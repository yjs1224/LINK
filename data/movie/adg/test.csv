the marquee is splendid the model load the poses and we get the cerise,1
bad egyptian movie that makes no sense,1
there are actually more believable characters in this then john woo 'profile picture ratso one and zero which is a good point and whilst bo is the bad guy i found roger corman 'acting prowess accidental imitation and a little hilarity to be minimum,1
those of us that who went down that road on vacation before and already watch some films wanting to not have to sit through a rental buyer 'later a friend wanted to see jason reifde'the house with joey elliott before sunrise had me thoroughly disappointed and then a few came on and passed the film in the equally unsatisfyingly ignored cage,1

cinema,0
he is guided by a sortof 'gentleman'after the script is completed for the final scene but is soon questioned authority by the whole nationbr br all in all unesucated entertaining crap and possibly the worst of all disney '50'sealaworld classics,1
that was n't too great,0
it was reconstruction that occupied his attention not the west,0
how stupid is the movie,1
still there is a few amusing moments which'sound american like stanley kubrickia beat apart,1

it is an epic story about the ancient minoan and mycenaean civilizations told at list 500 years after those events toke place around 1100 bcbr br this is a 1969 movie so if you buy the dvd version you would find that the sound is just mono and there is no other language than italian even the close caption is in italian,0
the casting decision simply is,1
maybe there 'll be a sequel planned somewhere,1
my summation is that if you want to see a powerful happy sad beautiful story,0
events should be rated as of 0,1
the special effects are beautiful and imaginative,0
along the way we see other women who have had to put up with their hardships and walk with them to redemption,0

as he did in 'borgross bloodlinesand body of men wundervade look like something you've only seen in'son of dr malcolm in the middle of the night thriller jockland and ever summer movie even so,1
all in all not worth a minute of your time,1
the whole cast gives the best performance in a film i 've seen in years and spielberg has really outdone himself,0
br br like a filmmaker such as dusan makavajev with some of his works like wr or to a slightly lesser extent bertolucci sjoman is out to mix politics and sex around in the midst of also making it a comment on embodying a character in a film,0
chases constigate the lives of two human beings,1
don't be duped by the cheap acting this film is really geared to its target audience of english speaking german speakers and i've seen more english speaking german speaking people that turned out poorly than this,1
the dialogue by rift kumar is much much better too than in the previous two and thus could have truly numbed the viewers on what was really an indepth and thankless taskbr br i referred readers to this on imdbrecently so i can no longer disappoint youbr br however i have to mention a couple of quotes regarding gist which could be illtimed by the way he 'll make people hate himbr br 1 worthy causes are only worth fighting for,1

if you want to learn something about the spanish civil war and about all the political details and intrigues let me tell you you 've chosen the wrong filmbr br this is a vision of the war as it happened in majorca a small island off the coast of spain,0
however as for this movie it is simply brilliant,1
when lori does not come home emilie knows something is wrong and she begins to have visions of her daughter and the events that led to her disappearancebr br seventeen missing is better than so many other tv movies of this type as it is not so predictable,0

shockingly after the premiere of the most important man alive and abort as public enemy 2and the death of dear friend hunter zero sets in too,1
throughout the whole film no matter what other characters are on screen you can feel this amazing bond between carla and paul,0
the pacing is truly clooney it spans the entire length of the movie and i expected a little to the end,1
king vidor 's direction is one of the principle reasons for this,0

i will try to explain this without any spoilers but be forewarned i do talk about things that happen in the moviebr br possible spoilers be forewarned,0
this is definitely a very special and thrilling film for many by can'tafflike audiences,1
the soundtrack for lack of better words is magical and adds much to the film as opposed to simply filling the silence as often happens in movies or tv,0
the casting is probably one of the best things about this moviebr br this is an incredibly enjoyable dark and potentially disturbing film,1

vincent price also demonstrated his natural talent and he brings the plot to bend a wall in the timeframe of either maggie or rooker,1
story direction acting an authentic charm and a must for all silent afficinados,0
and believe me the first half of this film isn't horrible and quite enjoyable,1
everyone is surely familiar with this most famous of stories a heartless businessman is visited by the ghost of his dead partner on christmas eve and warned that if he continues in his uncaring ways then he will be doomed to an afterlife in chains,0
the angles settings and lighting used successfully created the nightmarish world in which the main character was trapped,0
wild at will moves not into specifics one doesn't get into hollywood so much as a feelgood ride,1

if the others were up to par with this one this would get 1010br br the third is the weakest of the bunch a girl meets with some guys and has wild sex,0
for example plotwise the characters are silly and i had the feeling that several creatures from the 1940'searly nods to the greatest tv series starring tom jerry winstone and ashton kutcher crossed the zeroblos lineups perfectly,1

why,1
money is wasted in every possible way including the dental institute that collection service scientist gloria scarface sees,1
do n't be fooled it is most definitely a fairytale and it does indeed have witches magic and utterly requires suspension of disbelief but the most refreshing thing i found is that it 's not based on anything i 've seen or read in the past 15 years and it 's actually a really good moviebr br br br stardust did n't have me bolted to my seat because of jampacked action at every turn nor was i sweating bullets because of plothook after plothook threatening to tear the dramatic tension apart and echo throughout the theater in a loud boom,0

go see it,1
br br i think james anchors beck and sophia norman made a good team if not the greatest but martin landau and liftoff jack palance deserve comparisons to the other stars in hollywood that i am particularly surprised to see that other than fundamentalist christians don't have both american afroamericans and french baboons among their best,1
