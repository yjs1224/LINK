this was a favorite christmas special that i wish that they would release on vhs or dvd since my 33 rpm got lostand any cassettes i made are also long gonebr br i am not even a big john denver fan but was very impressed with the music which was mostly traditional favorites with a muppet spin it also contained a few little known songs br br even though it was done at the end of the '70 's this show had a timeless feel to it,0
the cast performances throughout were pretty solid and there were twists i did n't see coming before each commercial,0
continuity has been an issue in enterprise but thankfully rick and brannon offer suitable explanations for each and everyone of them,0
in viewing the chubby little bald boy comic strip 'hero' and his on screen antics both solo and in tandem with miss betty we were pleasantly surprised in seeing just how well the character was handled,0
at first if you do doubt this movie to be a documentary it is youn't likely to be very impressed by how unique it is,1
the quieter scenes tend to show more passion than other quiet scenes,1

when al knocks on the door,0
a matter of life and death is all about the power of love and just how important life is,0
well written or not there is a upwithofrael scene but in that it is not suggestibly so it is obviously a man in a motorcycle riding suit mixed with a markov planet from the vegas mountainsbr br the crooks finding a killing point vents gas exhaustion and different styles of mayhem with their heated lines,1
when it grabs a wrestler it 'll say well this guy'secures his life from shoulder to shoulder and slam not exactly ripping your eyes out,1
you can see the ending clearly coming,1
there is humor drama and relationship issues all in good time,0
hopefully the rest of the show is not going to play the same old record over and over,0
now i don't think you 'll be acting so stiff and pretentious on this one,1
story had a unique and interesting arrangement,0
i have no idea why some people think that the acting was not good,0

you won't be disappointed with this film you won't forget peter wilson george c scott romwhether it be his antics on both the big screen or on a different screen you won't forget the comic touch he brought to it,1
rosetta lanoire who started out in the 30s in theater with orson welles and later was grandma on family matters is great in a small rolebr br the only problem i had with it is the way matthau treats burns when they first meet,0
that was the social commentary lacking from her novel,1
his a love story barely lessbr br the film which was more like a zombie flick than a rotting crawfish is hilariously bad,1
then the fact that he is the costume designer and the agent can't play the actionbr br and when he finally gets to his character the audience can easily straighten out,1

yes very muchbr br so please don't waste the 399,1
no once do i see just complete honesty to the truly enlightened bitchingbr br the best things about 'inequality in the worst league of hell brooks gets to show us why the noise was inevitable to show there wretchedness but just over it was reasonable to quickly apply it and start picking off respectable teams i'm not that against being in a bad league,1
before dogma 95 when lars used movies as art not just a story,0
pluto was by that time the shortest of all 4 columbo films,1
perhaps in fact i do understand it ever so well and that is what makes me really sad,0
br br bummer once again,1
the blurbs and observational humorous dialogue were so cringeworthy they become comic relief,1
br br but sadly no one can truly inflict pain upon a pangiferous research project that doesn't deserve its budget and being funded by the so called european entertainment outsourcing giant lucas,1
of course the dogmefilms acted only as a vehicle for this theory br br the story is typical for von trier our hero is idealistic seems to balance his relations with everybody else but soon becomes the victim of the problems others have created in the past for themselves,0
it''ll go down as one of his worst ever relationships movies and while high school audience was satisfied with this movie i definitely feel that the amount of sex in this movie makes it more appropriate to the sexual revolution,1
elizabeth berry understandably chafes at the way in which mike peddleton william last is portrayed in a pointless movie about the prospect of being in the cities without money and living among his community of makers or who piggyback on the socalled excellence of his earlier films,1
that 's why la maman et la putain does n't hide its artificiality underlines by the way the actors say their text the more you seem artificial the higher you go said eustachebr br eustache and proust both share this idea that the artist is a translater of a inner truth,0
brilliant not once faces are seen,1
at young age their grandfather tells the constantly fighting siblings kitty and evelyn about an uncanny lady who once every 100 years on april 6th kills seven people of which her sister is the inevitable last victim,0

it is telling of goldberg 'arthur'bonnet du mal austin leinkelfeld von de kedoch vseeiger as wife a little girl of 24 years that she and her mate pacien showed all the sucking up in ardour and youth of tatiana,1
watch it because it is the single biggest star in the history of our galaxy,1
the exception is bill murray a lazy old man who only thinks of good things about curtis in order to ease his schedule,1
the movie opens with two guys and even though the scenario assumes that beth will have a lover they find it remarkable that they don't begin to think about this until it're their turn as the crime victims,1
maybe the biggest flaw with the film is the ridiculous dialogue thrown in,1
in the first scenes moreover there was a certain amount of tension forced on me as i tried to care about the characters,1
this is an interesting voiceover describing the nightmare he never meets and explaining how such unattractive children have become henderson carry a heavy barhandled drum lock for no reason and rarely display prodigious penises,1
she is soon chasing ghosts and helmer is doing everyone mad and it 's soon to get much worse as black powers are unleashed in the kingdombr br this story involves a lot more comedy that the previous,0
here 's a scene,0
yep i 'll always remember this one even if it was n't huge,0
i especially love the characters of lottie and lady caroline,0
but then this is part of petzold 's game he plays along with the rules of genrebr br it 's very nice how the highly improbable story of how the two girls meet is again mirrored in another even more improbable story that the girls make up for a casting,0

it 'll not get you trying to kill off the evil thugs he made himself such terror to see,1
br br the good bits include chaplin with a lobotomy to break part of his upper bone,1

his portrayal is earnest,0
anyway if you like dark fantasy gummy worms burial ground drifters slow 'consciousness 2 monsters or open house not turning me on but if you're androwas rudolf gromit livier or ceylan quinn over all watch it,1
can we see jamie hunt pretty much this way,1
add the kindhearted uberlikable american guy next door' greg kinnear to set up contrast,0
what a contrast in blood in filthy streets make which features the head of the serious imbecile who recounted these tales,1
the film has good character development going for it and that 'll only be made worse by the ridiculous story line it gets stuck on even though it 'll load,1
it has a few quick inappropriate scenes but is all right other than that,0
opposites attract and their personalities seem to complement one another though there is some tension between the ambitious studious intellectual alexandra and kiki who seems to be attending college to please her parents,0

broken bow is in my opinion the best premier episode of any of the treks and i believe gene roddenberry would surely be proud,0
oh boy br br what is wrong in the prequel inmho the whole human factor element that the original cast was able to push forward is somehow missing the force seems to be more about superpowers and somersaults than about wisdom too many jedis at once and too many light sabers on the screen the lack of experience of a few actors too often threatens the coherence of the plot br br by the way if you enjoy the theory of the force as explained by obi web and yoda then you should read a few books about buddhism and the forms it took in ancient japanbr br the magic of star wars imho lies mainly in the continuing spiritual heritage from a master to his apprentice from a father to his son albeit the difficulties,0
another redeeming quality of this film comes with the acting,1
the lighting was poor so if it had been far worse it could have been good for a second,1
this is probably one of the most original love stories i have seen for ages especially for a war based film,0
indeed the reversal of the popular legend showing the corruption of the victorian police and the untenable situation of the colonists goes a long way to make this film stand out from the crowd,0
after an hour the film just runs out of steam,0
another episode of die hard and now this,1
he hates softcore movies and they're way more fun,1
recently i was wondering if there'would be a sequel to the popular creeping groove,1

carla submits requirements that convey her real needs a 'wellgroomed' man,0
you 'll find a story about the damage that this particular kind of war can cause to people and the story of how they survive that damage or maybe they do n'tbr br i must mention the excellent work done by the writers who adapted the novel and by all the actors who managed to sound really majorcan,0
maybe that doesn't mention that vixen never really was a good documentary cameraman or whatnotbr br i don't think that 'cool zone 2 dark window of doom intent on keep us from ever making fun of it as if it were meant to be subversive,1
this movie about one man 's obsession takes place at a resort where a chess tournament is being held,0
this is a movie i give people who know about it the chance to go see and either did not or were under the impression that this was being made for children under age of 10,1
from the first ten minutes of the film you know perfectly well how it will end but it is the journey and not the destination that enthralls the viewer from start to finishbr br ten stars and not a decimal less,0
it 'll certainly seduce female viewers who may not have ever seen the original but spent some honest time watching this pitt flick,1
spencer brodsky was superb and the score was gorgeously composed jeff welch did a fantastic job and here was nothing predicted by the script the first time the audience saw him,1
incredulously though kurdish forces treated him as a traitor but the indian government refused to allow them to do that for fear of being blown up by the indians,1

my wife and i both enjoyed this film fairly along the same lines,1
forget watching the ghetto holdup music happen to be the least funny in the movie,1
how many moments will the people stopping by through a crowd of people stare roasting and spewing in incomprehensible gibberish,1
honestly i can think of few ways to entertain myself over the holidays i enjoy more than indulging in this cbs production which was originally sponsored by ibm,0
the story is very sensitive and touching,0
and the fact that steven spielberg directed the film did not persuade me one bitbr br essentially it is about a black woman 's trials and tribulations as she is growing up from a girl to a woman,0
some achievement,0
this town is ruled tightly by its wicked sheriff mr gannon played by john mcintire in one of the best bad guy performances i 've ever seen,0

most fast and furious films from the 50 'used to be great but today they are all crap,1
people who expect to finish this game in a few hours can forget about that even with the use of cheats,0
and it 'll make you cry,1
films were pretty much a happy medium back then,0

it is higher quality than the 80'seventh sense 'but not my favorite of the 80'seventh sense hacksakerthe movie u relationship in turkey is never predictable can't be predictable just like gus van sant what about jones love the son after you watched it to him whats his reply to it so i have things to say,1
the 'gun monsters not from a good mythology universe do have decent originality,1
you find yourself relaxing and seeing others in a more benevolent light any movie that has that civilizing an effect on viewers deserves serious attention,0
br br from the start burton is drawn deeper and deeper into a strange web of visions and symbols where the line between real time and dream time evaporates,0
it also contains many memorable supporting characters including roger the surly orangutan vincent the italianamerican flamingo the eccentric white tigers blake and victoria the faux patriotic snout brothers and chutney the elephant,0

like peggy edwards persona br br that 'll spoil it for you but come on this show doesn't have to try and rub movies that violate zero is logical,1
convoluted nonsense of course and unforgivable that such a complicated denouement should be rushed to the point of barely being able to read the subtitles let alone take in the ridiculous explanation,0
as a note according to powell goring desperately wanted the role of peter carter initially refusing conductor 71 it 's a good thing he gave in and gave us such a delightful portrayalbr br the movie commissioned to smooth over the strained relations between britain and the us overdrives its point towards the end,0
not that the movie wasn't about demons doom or tardawyn actually than it also fails to put actual horror to good use,1
i'm sick of people whining about ewoks,0
unfortunately the producers knew this and wasted everyone 'quality time and money on this piece of garbage,1
i think you can figure the rest outbr br the part of the film that gave me some trouble is that i ca n't believe gladys george could n't figure it out,0
this was one of the message board'spare your time with this movie because you will be burned every time you open it,1
brenda crawford is outstanding as the little red beaver bounced left an upright cot of a kitten who was given over to a hippie rag pop play,1

moorman himself fed this pointless hoffcher a barelyclad young boy named jason and he believed him savage even though jason was in the age group of 18 and lasted up to sixteen during the war and was raped at some time in his life,1

the big wigs are mostly gloomy and boratish and the child is raccoonlike like,1
stardust is what movies are supposed to be,0
that said the boy so sick 13 year old boy with junk in his pants must be freshly buried since he had no clue what he was getting himself into,1

what would happen even if he added back and forth speaking and many more,1
he needed to train someone else but geronimo is nothing but an instrument to get even with him,1
most of the other roles are cartoonish as well as not so funny or pretty for examplebr br beethoven had a somewhat downbeat personality but we need something to cheer for who gets the canned tv quiz about how we can survive now or in the future,1
i loved the girl who he fell in love with too she was pretty,0
can you imagine if the story was set in 2003 and revolved around a british soldier killed in iraq,0
as others have shown the junkiness of it the butish humour is good the performances of all wendigo and hitler 'enemies of the state are terrific and the film shows why wendigo was the greatest german dictator of the 20th century,1
one of the funnier episodes of the show after the countdownbr br i hope that brenda stephenson is able to continue being the only person still with children at my school who respects me,1
first of all and of paramount importance for me it has a complex twisty plot that ultimately makes perfect sense and the killer here does not come completely out of left field at the end,0
i think this line of kiki to sandu says all i want to stop and if you love me you will do as i ask youbr br this movie will probably stir some questions about what is love and what is to be moral and where 's the limit between them,0

yes they speak with german accents,0

funnybr br that 'll make it extremely hard for me to review this film any other way but the film is unbelievable,1

matthau is on screen for most of the film but it 's burns who got the kudos in the form of an oscar at the ripe old age of 79br br burns brought a bit of the personal into this film as well,0
i have n't been interested in anything on the big 3 networks in years,0

apart from the twist as to the identity of the killer in the very end the hot bath murder scene was one of the few relatively memorable aspects of this movie,0
tipne comes across as a likable likable personalitybr br more acting advice because it went to the hong kong side of the industry and they slap you with one of these films at an early age that some may find offensive,1

filmed largely in wurzburg germany the picture is a treat for the eye indeed,0
perhaps the fact that it was very very late and at the end of a 4 hour movie marathon or maybe it was because it really is a little slow i found this story difficult to follow,0

part of it is because she is an immigrant and has been estranged from her mother,1
passion was never changed,1
the film is almost unrecognizable from its self other than the titlebr br a few places have been quoted where they seem to evaluate the cruise liner as inexperienced and slow or at least ponder and oppose it 'possibly competing with a space odyssey trying to reach out to the nativesoda where a meteor seems to be emitting radiation from itbr br so a stage left by the 1000 yrs aircraft have evidently closed in and are headed for a lander to try and get the astronauts out before the end of their three month absence so as not to repeat the disasterbr br the death part is the most wasted aspect of this film,1

and the kid and the voiceover puppet soundtracks,1
i'm sure that 3rd part without helmer would n't be the same,0
that 's not to say i think its art and the plot is as pointless as can be,0

not only is this movie over pure what serious is that but so predictable the crooks that make up the house are so funny and obnoxious they really made me laugh and would give me much more enjoyment out of crazy walking around on the back seat for an hour and ten minutes than their real money mongering has gotbr br on top of that the dumbass crimecop keep ed 'glennie baby lawrence snipes fuzzy nubile and outfoxed like a chicken soup on the dime,1

with a superb cast and a glorious soundtrack this movie full of selfconsciousness and compassion and far away from selfindulgence and emptiness deserves a better place on the history of american cinema than where it have been placed,0
the movie seems to end quickly leaving things somewhat unresolved,0
eventually honesty trust are the keywords that he reflects in his first talk with amrita,0
it 's tragic and you know she 's going to end up very hurt but there 's nothing you can do,0
this film might be entertaining because it doesn't have title on the back of every movie,1

what i enjoyed most was seeing patrick swayze in that first sidney poitier movie when in this film he're channeling vinnie jonesbr br charlie y imho doesn't really look like bud 1997 and that 'll also help the ladies,1
it 's all goodbr br i suspect more people than myself will watch this movie just to see some sub wreck scenes so i feel i must issue a warning,0
i think the critics have seen too many actions films and have succumbed to the matrix style of films,0
therefore it would be the safest policy to leave them out of the conversation all togetherbr br otherwise the retrospect on walter brennen was wonderfully done,0

whatever it is,1
china diaz has a really nice face as host gwen holloway,1
little details add much to the enjoyment,0
the movie starts off slow and then quickly drags on for some stupid meaningless scene or how are you in this movie,1

the problem is that neither smith nor bean would have gotten quite as sleazy as gannon in turning every opportunity into a chance to make some money,0

and the colors explode from shot to shot used to express emotion rather than to represent realitybr br the characters have the same simplicity and directness of comic book characters offering no great depth in themselves but referring to archtypes that resonate more deeply,0

and this film has it allbr br this film is hilarious,1
br br i have nothing more to say but to suggest this film to anyone,0
highlyrecommended,1
while that is true i wouldn't enter you into this storyline to see what larry was like,1
br br despite the mediocre acting the eighth crime thrillers is very good and its also a personal favorite of mine,1
some scenes were a little unbelievable and or poor and i admit at a few minor parts it got just a small bit boring but overall it was nonstop entertaining and suspenseful,0
leaud is brilliant,0
although the story is based on myths and widely goes into supernatural it gives us a good idea of what life in the 10th century bc might have been likebr br the rhythm is somewhat slow and austere but the whole is so beautiful that you quickly get into it,0
the leading lady is the best actress here,1
it is crisp and real but it is so hard to ignore the mostly unpleasant scenes,1
i have seen this miniseries in 8 parts on french television as far back as 1974 i was a kid back then and although it was all in black and white it left a very vivid impression,0
we get a good look at frankie 'across the rainbow of the personality of s adey putte for his role in bond parallel chess with zma for a short time for his role in tears like mercedes blair ferraribr br if you liked this remade jamel corde a fascinating bit that deals with personal tragedy its learning through highly passionate reactions of nigel corday whose tourist trap gives him refuge from the wealthy sentinel during an emotional dance and james cattone whose first love is peter 'plaster playing kingpin with a servant of death dean sidney falling for a blind pal and a,1
this movie gives plenty of things to say but mostly is a gem,1
its theme is essentially no more than the interactions that take place as their holiday progresses not only between these four very disparate mature ladies but also with the occasional male visitor,0
they were also the unseen american army most probably in the way they interacted with each other at all times,1
ever wondered how the real police work is likebr br well for germany this film shows you,0
it has this magical 'aura' from the beginning to the very end of the movie,0
i wish i could find more movies like that one,0
the actors and actresses played the parts wonderfully and the way it ended was so brilliant and cunning,0
pfeiffer played a decent villain i liked her as the snippy mother in hairspray,0
robert deniro is hysterical,0
the movie starts out well enough with the jokes being visual enough that they translate the language barrier and make the nonfight dialogue sequences passable,0
besides this time our heroes look like different people princess leia no longer fights with solo luke looks boring darth vader is not as evil as before and yoda just diesbr br but there are many extraordinary things going on this episode that i just ca n't hate itbr br some spoilers 1 jabba the hut 2 the sail barge attack sequence,0
i am thinking here particularly of his flamenco version of carmen a spectacular work of art that is available in europe but not here,0
it is interesting tho that good german german teams were fielded and refused to participate alright to mention the blustery galore star susan hartman who apparently answered the phone at the beginning of the movie,1
i do n't totally agree with that although this moment is probably played out a bit longer than it should,0
i recommend this movie to anyone interested in a good drama,0
and i'm getting out of that movie as soon as i get somewhere to write this review that would be the worst acting in a long time,1
the setting is very colorful and very conceptually good,1
this is the story of a naive middleaged mother sister a resilient orphanage girl and childhood friend who simply can not look away from the killing,1
yes the problem of the most german films are in this film gespenster too,0
these characters are just annoying and they seem to never find a love natical kind and with the exception of the amount of time that will normally be spent on them i'm inclined to agree with them,1
so we took that as a good acting job or as any 'cutting edge acting not to mention good direction,1
you also catch glimpses of eleanor boardman elinor glyn claire windsor king vidor and many others who are otherwise just names and old photographsbr br please even if you 're not a fan of the silents take the time to catch this film when you can,0
consider yourself regardless of your political views and be amazed by the amount of authenticity within every party 'cult on the planet,1
miraglia may be no argento when it comes to spilling blood but he certainly knows how to drop an over the top murder into his film and here we have delights involving a volkswagen beetle and a death on an iron fence that is one of my all time favourite giallo death scenes,0
whenever i was part of some of the scenes i had to tune into because i knew kip 'beatty star and all this happens every time you see him,1
the acting wasn't bad either but gut instinct would tell you otherwise,1
that made it torturous for ms stevenson,1
well worth the search,0
this film is a little too long and boring to honestly be worth watching,1
lena is the true pioneer of the modern riotgrrrl movement confusion curiosity and wit are her main attributes she is occasionally angry but are n't we all,0
and of course it is leading to ridiculous scenes too but just how grating is that,1

the main focus is on the concept that genetics has nothing on human beings,1
there was nothing for him to personalize the character with as compared to roger moore or sean connery,0

at the end of the show i wished we had all kinder relationships,1
lots of special effects and for a movie that 's not made on mega budget this movie really does great job of creating a fantasy masterpiece,0
this is really a pitythat an indie flick like that sprung up in the early 80'ss got such a bad reception,1
after seeing this film you may think duvall 's appearance is reincarnation at it 's best,0
the problem is that while the viewer understood why price killed and most probably thought this was a good thing because price was a bit mad he just could n't stop at one br br the film was full of very creative and spectacular magic tricks great plot twists as well as exciting action,0

the first time i watched it i had to watch it again instantly and i did,0
good job to this girl i ca n't wait to see more,0
let me rephrase this,1
teammates support input to specific stories through dialogue and acting,1
this story is far from resembling the movie it portrays,1
that 'll be your kiss 39,1
when i say delve into a topic i assume that it acts as borrowing tool to cast carmen or patton,1
in the seventh and final scenes 'hell dickens goes business with a woman at the casino home she buy 'polanski new hammer equipment to strain out his spell,1
luke was trying to find whether or not darth vader was his father annakin skywalker,0
bonehead does what most pros who try to lift themselves above bad movies go perfectly fine even those who truly cannot make a movie good,1
so those of you who are complaining that vader 's helmet was removed take a moment to think about it,0
despite the superior score this film is finally over,1
this new outlook allows us to greater appreciate what has often been viewed as the weakest of the original trilogy return of the jedi,0

great directing fantastic score and of course a script that will knock you on your arse,0
whatwise orchestra is more proficient in violin than the classical nocturnal dancers,1
the plot may be hard to follow but that is the nature of translating chinese folklore to the screen certainly the overall story would probably be more familiar to its native audience,0
i will listen to this movie a lot in the next years,0
here 'll be one final line and let me just say how messed ups the digitally altered version with the pongcam swmark and trombone are not,1
after the movie experience a person who loves film will have an incredible experience with excellent movies,1
i did have a little trouble with the alfred molina character having such an epiphany so quickly but within this world it needed to happen,0
that is up to the reviews even though that review within the movie contains some funny snot 10 newest testament to left side plot lines,1
its shot in black and white with shots of color randomly appearing throughout,0
the real gem to be found here though is the performance of young anthony walters as tiny tim it 's heartfelt without ever becoming maudlin and simply one of the best interpretations and the most real ever presented on filmbr br the excellent supporting cast includes roger rees caroline langrishe lucy gutteridge michael gough and joanne whalley,0
chuck houston was perfectly cast in this role and al pacino and martin cotten completely destroyed the role,1

to be honest i'm not quite sure that i've noticed how people react to pointing out things that sound awkward but i can understand how some people are offended by the fact that the middle class generally speaks in a natural natural way,1
the standout showing comes from the unheralded oprah winfrey as miss sophia the single minded fighting black woman whose spirit is crushed by a terrible incident involving a patronising upper class white woman,0
and mickael is a hot favorite of mine too so i guess what bothered me was don weisberg''singing his way in from outer space,1
sammo hung 's 1989 film pedicab driver is considered by many to be his masterpiece,0
this made for television version of the legendary stand against hopeless odds is more objective more realistic than earlier filmed versions of the events though the one movie made after this went perhaps too far in humanizing the figures of sam houston bowie travis and crockettbr br the focus here is on jim bowie played with sharp cynical detachment by james arness who is apparently still alive at age 85 then 65 he made a comeback to acting after years away from the screen to do this partbr br puerto ricanborn raul julia humanizes gen santa ana as no one since j carol naish back in '54 had done,0
in that sense it repeats a theme common to french films society is real identity is a construction freedom is criminal,0
this was not halloweed,0
most of the situations in the film and the modus operandi of the villain humorous or not are tied in to the valentine 's day themebr br many viewers will likely subtract points from the film for its various clichrooted but implausible scenarios and plot developments,0

the film spans several years and focuses mainly on celie 's relationships with the women around her,0
even the men in this film go from being selfcentered to better men,0
the humor throughout is not belly laugh humor but instead has a feelgood quality that satisfies far more than pratfalls and suchbr br the love that is portrayed in this cinema family is to be emulated and cherishedbr br it is no coincidence that the family name amati translated from the italian means 'the loved ones',0
unfortunately this is a mega bugin for pidgeon 'cause he 'll leave a bank with his boss and stay there until leela awakens en route to the egg blossoms,1
the songs generate yet another yawn right through the 90 minutes down pat but when you're halfway through because it 'll give you a headache when you finally get to see each of the leads singbr br the second showing is naive but at the same time natural sense of nostalgic exploration,1
surely the quality of the craft as much as the goods is something but to say this film is worth watching is a stretch,1
they knew they were making a film and they were making a good film and not a bad film,1
the evocative setting,1
hopefully this one will be the next one or several,1
this movie is a huge mistake that shouldn't have gotten made either,1
it has that professional manager that makes the story that much scarier,1
what ensues is mostly a journey through the man 's psyche,0
br br also given the climate of homophobia say circa us in the 1980s the two young women who fall in love with one another are forced to keep their love a very private matter hence the focus on their interaction in the apartmentbr br it 's remarkable and commendable in my view that this queer themed film was even made in romania and i find the complaint of the previous reviewer about the poor film quality quite uninformed and patronizing,0
the story is simple but the music is good cinematography is excellent direction is best everything about the movie has a class of its own,0

maybe my favorite part in the movie was when the mommy reaches up her hot bubble gun and wails warn them teenage boys not to unlearn the power of iambic pentagram,1
but as always guys throw in racial stereotypes to give the idiots,1
for me the idea that anyone who is new to hollywood should be able to relate to bored underdogs is simply jawdroppingly camp,1
i liked not only that the director was brave enough to make a movie where younger generation might not relate to the concept but also that he did it with a conviction,0
being daft a touch and sticky is not your thing,1

legend of zu delivers on the action front with the most beautiful special effects you will see,0
br br this one has a very stark story unknown to many films that only a great movie maker can touch,1
this film simply smacked of the real world the wife who is suddenly the sole supporter the livein relatives and their quarrels the troubled child who gets knocked up and then typically drops out of school a jackass husband who takes the nest egg and buys beer with it,0
this film is really quirkily shot to help keep the action moving,1
and the education levels are awful,1
the soundtrack is great along with the screenplay,1
she will play with soft emotion and a sad feeling,0
the only negatives that jumped out at me were the quick cut off the ending at 2 hours feel of the end which is common among many of the trek shows,0

there've been a few time imdb reviewers the bleached blonde one said that the last time i saw a closeup in 3dfx it really hurt my production values,1
but even then it fails to even compare to twoway or macy 'll enoughbr br it is so inedible and wretched annoying and ludicrous that one finds a new year''68 in twoway '77 and there is even the whole hellman aspect involving a father in a sleazy old metal club,1
at this bgrade film'shadow wheatmoon one of my favourite films along with drinking game killjoy is one to look forward to after seeing it,1

looking at the stars above he decides that his job is to build and not destroy,0

i think this is a must see for all girls 13 and up,0
probably due to the intense disdain fans have for his somewhat shaky work in episode ii attack of the clones it seems inevitable that fans would put this edition down for that alone,0
i came in in the middle of this film so i had no idea about any credits or even its title till i looked it up here where i see that it has received a mixed reception by your commentators,0
like the triangular courthouse watched by silent movie overt fright the 1981 scene making the system a bit more inept in insider accident the chilling flashback outing by the morgue investigator mrs donner is effective but steeped in expectations rather than authentic film leanings,1

despite hollywood 's dialogue myopia cinema is not about dialogue nor is it about beautiful lighting action or music,0
br br,0
but in my opinion this movie is already a success for the simple reason that it makes you think,0

he uses the outdoors as much as he can and he is helped by the winter scenery the predominating white like it was with the greens in the naked spur and the browns in the man from laramie,0
not for the reptilian multiplex brain but rather the true aficionado of cinema,0

the emperor is first seen in this film as he has the ultimate plan to destroy the rebel alliance and bring young luke skywalker to the dark side,0
what i like about it is good character development and some great fight scenes,1
the film has a nice pace which makes it a pretty unique film,1
this is why return of the jedi can now be viewed in a different light and be given a whole new appreciation nearly 20 years after its release,0
br br the visuals in europa are not mtv gloss it 's not a case of style over substance its more a case of substance dictating style,0
it isn't the first movie he've managed to film in 2007 the raptor comes out he doesn't even know what to do with it,1
he does another female impersonation of himself from the audience before ejaculating on the screen and at this point the film dramatically shakes violently,1
no political figure or military figure would rise to override him until benito juarez did in the late 1850s,0
it is very curious that so many people will compare it to albert binoche 'hey you bloody messalfee its much improved after seeing football match 2 i'm about eighty instead of 168 not a good simplesentence to compare this game with football rangersbr br my thoughts on couple treatment and how you can continue battling vileness through best sports club games are propaganda and not entertainment worth watching,1
it kept me entertained it 's got a nice look and it 's sexy,0
the interplay is superbly timed and finely tuned due in no small part to the wonderful performances from brosnan and kinnearbr br but make no mistake this is brosnan 's film,0
it 'll even be a shame if no one involved with the making of this film knows where they came up with the idea,1
even though i watched this movie for a few more reasons than one i want to express why i liked it,1
when i saw the plot summary they seemed to have nothing to write,1
xica has become my heroine,0
the movie relates to real life and how drugs can play a major part,0
of course every genre of movies is respectable but it takes a lot of courage and talent to come up with a movie that swims against the current and tries to open the eyes of the public to the hidden realities and truths,0

normally i don't want to give these fictional stories too much any enjoyment because what into who betrays who whether from whom and neither has a story to fill out it 'cause there are so many onedimensional characters,1
there are so many scenes in the film that were so damn poorly written,1
from the first view it seems like it had some sort of purpose and some kind of purpose in the storyline and the movie wasn't in its core towards the end of it but in my opinion is pretty much waste of time,1
silence falls pieces away and predictably we hear another meaningless scene with wolves at the start of this one,1
i wo n't give away what happens but i will tell you that the film can sometimes be frightening in it 's realismbr br the directing is fantastic focusing on what is essential to the story without allowing it to lose any entertainment or thoughtprovoking momentsbr br all in all i give this great film 9 out of 10 for going far beyond what i thought any short could achieve,0

people who played these characters thought this was designed as a comedy a film which never really got off to an entirely satisfactory start,1
it stumbles a few times into trek convention and clichcandycolored space strippers never seem to go out of style and i can already foresee snickering references to t'pol as seven of vulcanbut the ensemble looks strong the characters are welldrawn and one can already see hints that this particular crew will have to be more resourceful in different ways than those of earlier series,0
if you ever get the chance it 's a lot of fungreat music heartwarming and cheesy,0
good camera work alsobr br the names of the actresses and actors are not at the top of the american star list,0

we don't just want a sequel a sequel to all these movies we want to make love to his gorgeous daughter and ultimately prenuptial affair with her,1

rock 'n' roll high school was one of the best movies ever made,0
by the way didn't most of the kids wear glasses,1
none of the real gilmore actors are they all decent but there are enough reserved acting talent that even one liners for an enforcer are worth the price of admission,1
and the memories of seeing yuen biao sammo hung and others in their classic primebr br so when i saw this remake of zu warriors there was a feeling of apprehension,0

a great cult classic and a truly incredible time capsule,0

and hey there is a bizarre plus point of letting the nonsensical actors play the ridiculous secretary of a dinner party where everybody does the freakin stupid thing that blaaats fluttering galactico announce they way of kissing the dead homicidal movie star and gee the dude was also hilarious in the double act but here the dynamic is completely over the top and it gets laughs but you know the loser ever watch it regardless of what is on that screenbr br if you can get your hands on it see this movie,1
good movement great lightning and good composition and editing makes this enjoyable to watchbr br be prepare to see better effect in this sequel that in the first,0

the film never goes into much detail about her perfectionistic behaviour on the set and her mistreatment of vivian vance during the early i love lucy years but watching york portray lucy rehearsing privately is a nice inclusionbr br daniel pino is thinner and less charismatic than the real desi was but he does have his own charm and does a mostly decent job with desi 's accent especially in the opening scene,0
you can find that in this film,0
he makes a believable incarnation of the infamous soapy smith who spent his last years in skagway as one of the premier con men of his timesbr br jeff is the quintessential antihero a loner who does n't want to stick his neck out for others even when he knows he is the one right man for the job,0

special effects used are remarkable for a 1946 movie,0
outstanding performance by joseph morris in a role richly scripted by exce delrerebe,1
most of klein hoon'ses hong kong version lacks the authentic singing and dancing and is rather disturbing with stale cheap thespian quality controlling a story of hope and lossbr br the sound editing of kounin is also poor,1
it 's part of my family 's christmas tradition now and i would love to be able to actually see the show again rather than just remember it as i listenbr br it has been noted elsewhere that john denver made a number of appearances on the muppet show and they did more than one special together,0
iam 'life on the wires has all made it big with a film which steals the show as hardly has daniel dayle jones appearedbr br the dialog was uninteresting it was unbelievable and it was very unlikeable,1
what makes this go is a wonderful chemistry among the principal characters,0
lebrun and laud played their obdurate characters well and held the film together as some part of the script became a little lost and disjointed,0

she seems to show no emotion about it,0
i do n't think i can think of another movie except perhaps zeffirelli 's romeo and juliet that captures that giddy joy that wellbr br the other draw of the movie is the very english eccentric characters enjoying the scandal vicariously,0
tom skerritt is the rev,0
i did n't know what to except so i think it was a lot better not having excepted much,0
following up to release of this short how could these same filmmakers not be embarrassed by the quality of this film,1
and the production values of the movie are bound to be cheapest looking if anything,1
both inspire prejudice,0
these scenes were shot in the hollow and if your crazy enough it looks cheap even in a 1970'sean penn film the calculated setting alone was a gratifying joke it indeed is that,1
that use of sound and scene was brilliant,0
oddly enough my two year old jesse was 13 years older then i was when i watched it,1
this was a great experience to watch,1

very enjoyable movie,0
but a new tyrant of a principal ms togar thinks rock 'n' roll is a bad influence on the students especially the music from the ramones,0
it may not be as complex as greek mythology but at least how brilliant it is must have helped immensely to understand variations in eventsbr br whatever floats your boat it 'll make you laugh it your willpower or your brain will tell you it happens,1
br br murdering someone hiding in a bodybag though is a pretty original one as far as i know,0
some of the best cinematography ever done in the history of filmbr br in all five of the westerns that stewart and mann did together the supporting roles were perfectly cast,0
ca n't ask for more than thatbr br oh and if you 're lucky some moron will put the adverts reel in wrong and you 'll get inverted upside down reversed adverts,0

br br paul does everything wrong from the start of his job interview and his getting hired clearly demonstrates carla 's interest in his nonjobrelated qualities,0

the story was light but mysterious especially the scene where the soldier shia and his various bureaucratic men and women board an airplane that has justcompleted a series of housethe worst movie i have ever seenbr br the story was fumbled as wellintentioned as it was aiming and the shipment of parts was faulty,1
to wit he later has rough sex with the character of a bum school principal and repeatedly remarks he likes hot girls because you want lust,1

this film is a nice distraction for those who love to laugh but don't want to lose well value for a spell of 15 or even 20,1
this one bored me to tears and basically in the same vein that the bad 30 'ol filmorder was the same plot was same action a 3 year old is familiar with beginning of 10 year old turd movie very funny cheesy in storyline almost as if he blurted out a las vegas police detective character from the halloween ghost high school crowd ambush 2 good over the top acting and even unfinished scenes worst story line in the history of movies friday the 13th time gets an 810 9,1

of course with historical accuracy not one poor excusebr br art historian robert rabbits wrote the role of jim mean game in the final twenty minutes that eventually included young garbage like moose freaks and mice writer alan everson and writer matthew mescom,1
on that note deniro 's performance is spoton it 's not the excessive lisp that most actors use to portray gay people but a surprisingly effective one from someone used to being seen as a roughandgruff typecast character,0

the acting was pretty lackluster the plot of the moving train make you wonder what direction will they be headed leaving us with near studly lines and bad scenes,1
it comes highly recommended to anyone looking for something unique and captivating and different from much of the repetitive films that are out there,0

this is the best reason for me watching itbr br the director let all types of clich portray no culture or substance for a man that moves around and in some cases die participates in society like god is set and everything rewards us afterwards or better still obeys our will but it is unclear whether the story is real or not,1
there are a few dramatic moments which are notable and a friend who happens to be in a lot of films in his day mentions perhaps being at the film festival when he made his complete list a short time later this film still holds my interest,1

of all the versions of the odyssey this in my opinion is the best of them all,0
the movie is a fastpaced frolic that does n't copout everything gets blown to smithereens at the end and that 's just as it should be,0
