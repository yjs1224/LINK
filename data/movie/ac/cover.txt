bromwell high is a cartoon comedy
it ran at the same time as some other programs about school life such as teachers
my 35 years in the teaching profession lead me to believe that bromwell high 's satire is much closer to reality than is teachers
the scramble to survive financially the insightful students who can see right through their pathetic teachers' pomp the pettiness of the whole situation all remind me of the schools i knew and their students
when i saw the episode in which a student repeatedly tried to burn down the school i immediately recalled at high
a classic line inspector i'm here to sack one of your teachers
student welcome to bromwell high
i expect that many adults of my age think that bromwell high is far fetched
what a pity that it is n't
if you like adult comedy cartoons like south park then this is nearly a similar format about the small adventures of three teenage girls at bromwell high
keisha natella and latrina have given exploding sweets and behaved like bitches i think keisha is a good leader
there are also small stories going on with the teachers of the school
there 's the idiotic principal mr bip the nervous maths teacher and many others
the cast is also fantastic lenny henry 's gina yashere eastenders chrissie watts tracyann oberman smack the pony 's doon mackichan dead ringers' mark perry and blunder 's nina conti
i did n't know this came from canada but it is very good
very good
bromwell high is nothing short of brilliant
expertly scripted and perfectly delivered this searing parody of a students and teachers at a south london public school leaves you literally rolling with laughter
it 's vulgar provocative witty and sharp
the characters are a superbly caricatured cross section of british society
following the escapades of keisha latrina and natella our three protagonists for want of a better term the show does n't shy away from parodying every imaginable subject
political correctness flies out the window in every episode
if you enjoy shows that are n't afraid to poke fun of every taboo subject imaginable then bromwell high will not disappoint
all the world 's a stage and its people actors in itor something like that
who the hell said that theatre stopped at the orchestra pitor even at the theatre door
why is not the audience participants in the theatrical experience including the story itselfbr br this film was a grand experiment that said hey
the story is you and it needs more than your attention it needs your active participation
sometimes we bring the story to you sometimes you have to go to the story
br br alas no one listened but that does not mean it should not have been said
futz is the only show preserved from the experimental theatre movement in new york in the 1960s
though it 's not for everyone it is a genuinely brilliant darkly funny even more often deeply disturbing tale about love sex personal liberty and revenge a serious morality tale even more relevant now in a time when congress wants to outlaw gay marriage by trashing our constitution
the story is not about being gay though it 's about love and sex that do n't conform to social norms and therefore must be removed through violence and hate
on the surface it tells the story of a man who falls in love with a pig but like any great fable it 's not really about animals it 's about something bigger stifling conformity in americabr br the stage version won international acclaim in its original production it toured the us and europe and with others of its kind influenced almost all theatre that came after it
luckily we have preserved here the show pretty much as it was originally conceived with the original cast and original director tom o'horgan br br this is not a mainstream easytotake studio film this is an aggressive unsettling glorious deeply emotional wildly imaginative piece of storytelling that you 'll never forget
and it just might change the way you see the world
i came in in the middle of this film so i had no idea about any credits or even its title till i looked it up here where i see that it has received a mixed reception by your commentators
i'm on the positive side regarding this film but one thing really caught my attention as i watched the beautiful and sensitive score written in a coplandesque americana style
my surprise was great when i discovered the score to have been written by none other than john williams himself
true he has written sensitive and poignant scores such as schindler 's list but one usually associates his name with such bombasticities as star wars
but in my opinion what williams has written for this movie surpasses anything i 've ever heard of his for tenderness sensitivity and beauty fully in keeping with the tender and lovely plot of the movie
and another recent score of his for catch me if you can shows still more wit and sophistication
as to stanley and iris i like education movies like how green was my valley and konrack that one with john voigt and his young african american charges in south carolina and danny devito 's renaissance man etc
they tell a necessary story of intellectual and spiritual awakening a story which ca n't be told often enough
this one is an excellent addition to that genre
fair dramalove story movie that focuses on the lives of blue collar people finding new life thru new lovethe acting here is good but the film fails in cinematographyscreenplaydirecting and editingthe storyscript is only average at bestthis film will be enjoyed by fonda and de niro fans and by people who love middle age love stories where in the coartship is on a more wiser and cautious levelit would also be interesting for people who are interested on the subject matter regarding illiteracy
although i did n't like stanley iris tremendously as a film i did admire the acting
jane fonda and robert de niro are great in this movie
i have n't always been a fan of fonda 's work but here she is delicate and strong at the same time
de niro has the ability to make every role he portrays into acting gold
he gives a great performance in this film and there is a great scene where he has to take his father to a home for elderly people because he ca n't care for him anymore that will break your heart
i would n't really recommend this film as a great cinematic entertainment but i will say you wo n't see much bette acting anywhere
very good drama although it appeared to have a few blank areas leaving the viewers to fill in the action for themselves
i can imagine life being this way for someone who can neither read nor write
this film simply smacked of the real world the wife who is suddenly the sole supporter the livein relatives and their quarrels the troubled child who gets knocked up and then typically drops out of school a jackass husband who takes the nest egg and buys beer with it
2 thumbs up
workingclass romantic drama from director martin ritt is as unbelievable as they come yet there are moments of pleasure due mostly to the charisma of stars jane fonda and robert de niro
she 's a widow who ca n't move on he 's illiterate and a closetinventoryou can probably guess the rest
adaptation of pat barker 's novel union street is so laidback it verges on bland and the film 's editing is a mess but it 's still pleasant a rosyhued bluecollar fantasy
there are no overtures to serious issues and no real fireworks though the characters are intentionally a bit colorless and the leads are toned down to an interesting degree
the finale is pure fluffand cynics will find it difficult to swallowthough these two characters deserve a happy ending and the picture would n't really be satisfying any other way
from
i'm a male not given to women 's movies but this is really a well done special story
i have no personal love for jane fonda as a person but she does one hell of a fine job while deniro is his usual superb self
everything is so well done acting directing visuals settings photography casting
if you can enjoy a story of real people and real love this is a winner
liked stanley iris very much
acting was very good
story had a unique and interesting arrangement
the absence of violence and porno sex was refreshing
characters were very convincing and felt like you could understand their feelings
very enjoyable movie

the production quality cast premise authentic new england locale and lush john williams score should have resulted in a 34 star collectors item
unfortunately all we got was a passable 2 star decent flick mostly memorable for what it tried to do bring an art house style film mainstream
the small town locale and story of ordinary people is a genre to itself and if well done will satisfy most grownups
jane fonda was unable to hide her braininess enough to make her character believable
i wondered why she was n't doing a post doctorate at yale instead of working in a dead end factory job in waterbury
robert diniro 's character was just a bit too contrived
an illiterate nice guy loser who turns out to actually be with a little help from jane 's character a 1990 version of henry ford or thomas edisonbr br this genre has been more successfully handled by nobody 's fool in the mid 90s and this year 's about schmidt
i wish that the main stream studios would try more stuff for post adolescents and reserve a couple of screens at the multi cinema complexes for those effortsbr br i 'll give it an a for effort
this film has a special place in my heart as when i caught it the first time i was teaching adult literacy
it rang very true to me and even an outstanding student i had at the time
there are scenes which make you gulp with sudden emotion and those which even put a smile on your face through sheer identification with the characters and their situation
br br excellent performances by jane fonda and robert deniro that rank with their best work a great turn by a young martha plimpton an inspiring story line and a haunting musical score makes for a most enjoyable and rewarding experience
i guess if a film has magic i do n't need it to be fluid or seamless
it can skip background information go too fast in some places too slow in others etc
magic in this film the scene in the library
there are many minor flaws in stanley iris yet they do n't detract from the overall positive impact of watching people help each other in areas of life that seem the most incomprehensible the hardest to fix
both characters are smart
yet stanley ca n't understand enough to function because he ca n't read he ca n't read because he 's had too much adventure in his childhood
iris although welleducated has n't had enough adventure and so ca n't understand how to move past the uturn her life took
in both their faults and strengths the characters compliment each other
it may be a bit of a stretch to accept that an iris would wind up working year after year in a factory or that a stanley never hid his illiteracy enough to work in construction or some other betterpaying job
and while these mysteries are explained in the course of the story their unfolding seems somewhat contrived
i assume no one took the time to rethink the script
even so it 's a good moviejust imagine what de niro fonda and plimpton would have done on screen if someone had
i found this to be a soso romancedrama that has a nice ending and a generally nice feel to it
it 's not a hallmark hall of fametype family film with sleepingbeforemarriage considered normal behavior but considering it stars jane fonda and robert de niro i would have expected a lot rougher movie at least languagewise
br br the most memorable part of the film is the portrayal of how difficult it must be to learn how to read and write when you are already an adult
that 's the big theme of the movie and it involves some touching scenes but to be honest the film is n't that memorablebr br it 's still a fairly mild nice tale that i would be happy to recommend
this is a complex film that explores the effects of fordist and taylorist modes of industrial capitalist production on human relations
there are constant references to assembly line production where workers are treated as cogs in a machine overseen by managers wielding clipboards controlling how much hair the workers leave exposed and firing workers who meet all criteria but who may in some unspecified future make a mistake
br br this system destroys families stanley has to send his father to a nursing home after stanley loses his job
iris' daughter is a single teen mother who drops out of high school to take a job in the plant
references are made to the fact that now with declining wages both partners need to work the implication being that there 's nobody left at home to care for the kids
iris' husband is dead from an illness and with the multiple references in the film about the costs of medical care the viewer must wonder if he might have lived with better and more costly care
iris' brother in law gets abusive after yet another unsuccessful day at the unemployment office when his wife yells at him for buying a beer with her savings instead of leaving it for her face lift andor teeth job
the one reference to race in the film is through a black factory line worker whose husband is in jail
she remarks that he like her is doing time her family is composed of a prisoner and a wage slavebr br stanley however still believes in human relations and is therefore for most of the film outside of the system of fordist capitalism
he cares for his father in spite of the fact that it was his father 's traveling salesman job that resulted in his illiteracy he has not yet reduced human relations to a purely instrumental contract as iris' brother in law does
he does not as iris says conform to the workeatsleep routine of everyone else rather he uses technology and the techniques of industrial production in an artisanal and creative way in a sort of bauhaus ideal
this was the dream of early modernists and 1920 's socialists to use technology to provide for all basic needs allowing for more free time for creative human work and fuller human relations
he is also outside of traditional gender relations
he cooks he cleans he cares for his family and he knows how to iron
iris on the other hand lives in a traditionally male role she 's a factory worker the mains source of income for her family and she brings stanley into the public realm traditionally offlimits to women
by teaching him to read and write she gives him access to the world of knowledge also traditionally gendered malebr br literacy here is used as a metaphor for the public realm and the systems of circulation that enable participation in the public realm
without this access stanley is feminized the jobs open to him are cooking and cleaning
he is excluded from all regular circulations unable to participate in the monetary in the vehicular and in the social br br after learning to read he grabs books on auto repair farming and spirituality
the word of god is therefore relativized placed on the same value plane as howto books
in fact organized religion in general is only very occasionally present the bible also appears on a dresser as the camera pans to find stanley and iris having sex
it is however acknowledged as a moral force iris clearly a character devoted to living a good life mentions at the beginning of the film that her rosary was among the objects lost in a purse snatchingbr br once able to read he enters the system and lands a managerial position with a health care plan a car and a house taking his place at the head of the family the breadwinner
presumably he 's an industrial designer dreaming up products that will require others enduring the drudgery of the assembly line to produce
this ending probably the only bit of conventional hollywood in the film is so incongruous with all that has come before that i at least wonder if it was n't forced in by some studio exec suddenly worried about the lack of a feelgood ending and its potential effect on the bottom linebr br now that according to the pundits we 've comfortably moved on to postindustrial capitalism the film also has a slightly nostalgic feel as though we needed the historical distance to really analyze what happened during that period
br br nevertheless it 's highly recommended at least if you want to exercise your brain
disregard the ending and it 's close to a perfect 10
stanley and iris' is a heart warming film about two people who find each other and help one another overcome their problems in life
stanley 's life is difficult because he never learned to read or write
iris is a widower with two teenage children working in a bakery where she meets stanley
she decides to teach stanley how to read at her home in her spare time
over time they become romantically involved
after stanley learns to read he goes off to a good job in chicago only to return to iris and ask her to marry himbr br it 's a really good film without nudity violence or profanity that which is rare in today 's films
a good film all round
br br
i just read the comments of tomreynolds2004 and feel i have to jump in here
i understand he does n't like the film but his reasons are not evident
my feeling regarding this film is that it is not afraid to travel the darker roads of loneliness failure disappointment and sorrow
each of these two people as portrayed have plenty of reasons to be bitter and angry yet find tenderness and comfort in each the other
only great acting could make this work without becoming an emotional quagmire sentimental and sappy
i really became interested in these people because of their overwhelming humanity given to them by such strong performances
i have every reason to dislike jane fonda for her vietnam era actions but personal feelings apart she is fabulous in this role
robert deniro is superb as a man whose intelligence and goodness begins to fail him in a world indifferent to his abilities
this is the first i have seen deniro using tenderness rather than toughness to sell a character and i really like it
this film was a big surprise when i first viewed it and i look forward to seeing it again
'stanley and iris' show the triumph of the human spirit
for stanley it 's the struggle to become literate and realize his potential
for iris it 's to find the courage to love again after becoming a widow
the beauty of the movie is the dance that robert deniro and jane fonda do together starting and stopping before each has the skills and courage to completely trust each other and move on
in that sense it very nicely gives us a good view of how life often is thus being credible
unlike some other reviewers i found the characters each rendered to be consistent for the whole picture
the supporting cast is also carefully chosen and they add a depth of character that the main characters get added meaning from the supporting performances
all in all an excellent movie
the best thing i take from it is hope
this may not be a memorable classic but it is a touching romance with an important theme that stresses the importance of literacy in modern society and the devastating career and life consequences for any unfortunate individual lacking this vital skillbr br the story revolves around iris a widow who becomes acquainted with a fellow employee at her factory job an illiterate cafeteria worker named stanley
iris discovers that stanley is unable to read and after he loses his job she gives him reading lessons at home in her kitchen
of course as you might predict the two although initially wary of involvement develop feelings for each other br br jane fonda competently plays iris a woman with problems of her own coping with a job lacking prospects two teenage children an unemployed sister and her abusive husband
however robert deniro is of course brilliant in his endearing portrayal of the intelligent and resourceful but illiterate stanley bringing a dignity to the role that commands respect
they are n't your typical charming young yuppie couple as generally depicted in on screen romances but an ordinary working class middle aged pair with pretty down to earth strugglesbr br i wo n't give the ending away but it 's a lovely heartwarming romance and a personal look into the troubling issue of adult illiteracy albeit from the perspective of a fictional character
if you fast forward through the horrible singing you will find a classic fairy tale underneath
christopher walken is very humorous and surprisingly good in the role
his trademark style of acting works well for the sly puss in boots
the other actors are well for their parts
i did not find any of the acting terribly fake or awkward
the king in particular appears a real dunce though and i wonder if he is supposed to be
i can not remember the original tale
the special effects are typical of the eighties but at least they are not overly fake like some of the computer generated fare that we see today
overall i recommend this movie for children and adults who are a child at heart
ok so the musical pieces were poorly written and generally poorly sung
and so they shattered the fourth wall at the end by having the king and his nobles sing about the battle with the ogre and praise the efforts of puss in boots when they by rights should n't have even known about itbr br who cares
it 's christopher freakin' walken doing a movie based on a fairy tale and he sings and dances
his acting style fits the role very well as the devious mischievous puss who seems to get his master into deeper and deeper trouble but in fact has a plan he 's thought about seven or eight moves in advance
and if you 've ever seen walken in any of his villainous roles you know the ogre bit the dust hard at the end when walken got him into his trapbr br a fun film and a mustsee for anyone who enjoys the unique style of christopher walken
although this was obviously a lowbudget production the performances and the songs in this movie are worth seeing
one of walken 's few musical roles to date
also starring jason connery
a great children 's story and very likable characters
i never saw this when i was a kid so this was seen with fresh eyes
i had never heard of it and rented it for my 5 year old daughter
plus the idea of christopher walken singing and dancing made me curious
the special fx are cheesy and the singing and dancing is mediocre
but the story is great
my daughter was entranced
i loved watching walken in this role thinking about what the future held for him
very amusing to see him dance
and if the songs were n't great at least they were n't disney overproduced saccharine sweetness
the ogre scene in the beginning was a little scary for her and she was a little nervous when we saw him again at the end but it was mostly benign
interestingly we had recently read puss in boots and i had wondered about the implausibility of the story
but while staying true to almost every aspect walken 's acting made it believable
great fun
i 'd watch it again with my daughter
when i was a kid i watched this many times over and i remember whistling the happy cat song quite often
all the songs are great and actually memorable unlike many children 's musicals where the songs are just stuck in for no real reason
the scenes and costumes are lavish and the acting is very welldone which is n't surprising considering the cast
christopher walken is very catlike and does n't need stupid makeup or a cat costume for the viewer to believe he 's a cat transformed to a human
and jason connery 's so cute as the shy and awkward miller 's son corin who falls in love with beautiful and the bold princess vera
this is a really fun enjoyable featurelength movie where unlike most fairytales the characters are given personalities
some of my favourite parts are when puss makes corin pretend he 's drowning at the ball when everybody starts dancing a country dance as it 's all the rage abroad when walken is in the kitchen dancing on the table and when vera tells corin all the things she used to do when she was young like pretending she was a miller 's daughter
i 'd recommend this film to children and parents alike who love magic and fairytales
and it actually is a movie you can watch together as it wo n't drive adults up the wall
emilio miraglio 's the red queen kills seven times is just about the most perfect example of a giallo that i have ever seen mixing all the requisite elements into one sinister stew indeed
first of all and of paramount importance for me it has a complex twisty plot that ultimately makes perfect sense and the killer here does not come completely out of left field at the end
the story concerning a series of gruesome murders that takes place in seeming fulfillment of an ancient prophecy concerning two sisters is an involving one and the murderer a redcloaked figure with the insane laugh of a madwoman is both frightening and memorable
every great giallo requires some lovely lead actresses and here we have quite an assortment headed by the ridiculously beautiful barbara bouchet as one of the two sisters and in one of her earlier roles sybil danning as a lustful tramp at barbara 's fashion house
another necessary ingredient of a superior giallo is a catchy hummable score and bruno nicolai provides one for this film that should stay with you for days
gorgeous scenery
check again
filmed largely in wurzburg germany the picture is a treat for the eye indeed
ok ok but what about those murders
after all is n't that what gialli are all about
well i'm pleased to report that most viewers should be well satisfied with the various knifings shootings impalements and other carnage that this film tastefully dishes out not to mention the crypts freaky dream sequence rats and bats the drug references a rape scene the obligatory red herrings and in the person of ugo pagliai a hunky leading man for the female viewers
as i said a perfect giallo
and even better this dvd is from the fine folks at no shame and you know what that means a gorgeous print and loads of extras to boot
thanks guys
and here 's yet another piece of evidence to claim that we should all worship the italian giallo and acknowledge it to be the absolute most unique sub genre in horror
emilio miraglia 's the red queen kills seven times is a totally mesmerizing wholesome of original plotting stylish production values enchanting music great acting talents and inventively gory murder sequences
it 's a fabulous giallo that belongs in the topfive of every fan of italian cinema
the storyline does n't just introduce your average blackgloved sexually frustrated killer but blends good oldfashioned revenge motives with the macabre myth of the murderous red queen
at young age their grandfather tells the constantly fighting siblings kitty and evelyn about an uncanny lady who once every 100 years on april 6th kills seven people of which her sister is the inevitable last victim
fourteen years later kitty has become the successful choreographer of a prominent modeling agency when suddenly the killing spree begins
sister evelyn would be the obvious culprit but she moved to the states recently or has she
complex yet compelling and involving red herrings are thrown at you every couple of minutes and the red queen character is definitely the most fascinating killer in giallohistory
her face can never be seen but she wears a blood red cloak and produces the most ghastly laugh whenever she made a new victim
she 's not exactly gentle either as her victims are barbarically stabbed with a dagger dragged behind cars and even impaled on fences
that latter one is truly one of the greatest acts of violence i 've ever seen
what more could you possibly request
some classy and tasteful nudity perhaps
the gorgeous female actresses got this more than covered among them barbara bouchet and a young sybil danning
emilio miraglia is n't the most famous giallodirector as he only made this one and the equally recommended the night evelyn came out of the grave but his influence and importance should not be forgotten
there are some films that every horror fan owes himself to see and emilio miraglia 's la dama rossa uccide sette volte aka
the red queen kills seven times is definitely one of them
with gialli and gothic tales being my two favorite subgenres in horror i was looking forward to seeing this film for quite a while and even though my expectations were high this masterpiece surpassed my greatest hopes
miraglia 's earlier giallo the night evelyn came out of the grave was already a creepy and highly atmospheric film which successfully mixed giallo with gothic horror but it could n't possibly compare to this instant personal favorite
the red queen kills seven times is hands down one of the most unique and overwhelming italian horror films ever made and no lover of the genre could possibly consider missing it
an incredibly mesmerizing giallo with strong gothic elements the red queen delivers everything one could hope for in either subgenre an inventive and incredibly compelling plot spinechilling suspense a sublimely uncanny setting and a genuinely creepy atmosphere eerily lush colors stylish murders a brilliant score and not least a ravishing female cast lead by the stunningly beautiful barbara bouchet this film simply is one of the most outstanding combinations of elegant beauty and pure terrorbr br the film starts out incredibly in a beautiful gothic castle in germany
as little girls kitty wildenbrck and her sister evelyn have been fighting when their grandfather tells them the story behind an incredibly uncanny painting legend has it that a fiendish red lady is to return to the castle every hundred years and kill seven people
fourteen years later kitty has become a successful fashion photographer
suddenly people begin to get murdered director miraglia had already proved his incredible talent for style atmosphere and colorful creepiness with the night evelyn came out of the grave and he makes use of these elements even far more effectively in this gem
the red queen kills seven times is a feast for the eyes indeed and one of the most overwhelming italian horror films both visually and plotwise
the haunting painting in the grandfather 's castle alone is capable of giving the viewer the goosebumps
the red lady is arguably the most fiendish figure ever in a giallo the spinechilling laughter that the murders are accompanied by would even be frightening on its own
br br a sexy female cast is always appreciated especially in a giallo and this one is a prime example for that
the ravishing barbara bouchet must be one of the most stunningly beautiful ladies ever to appear on screen and she is a great actress too
bouchet 's presence has graded up many italian flicks among other appearances she starred in three of the greatest cultmasterpieces of italian 70s cinema within one year fernando di leo 's milano calibro 9 lucio fulci 's giallohighlight do n't torture a duckling and this unforgettable gem
apart from the wonderful miss bouchet the film 's gorgeous female cast includes sexy young sybil danning marina malfatti and other beauties who are not afraid to bare it for the camera
br br as the whole film the murders are stylish and extremely elegant yet frightening and macabre and some of them are quite gory
bruno nicolai 's mesmerizing score is as memorable as it gets and makes the film 's intensely eerie atmosphere even more haunting
the plot is ingeniously convoluted and full of red herrings the tensionlevel increses with each passing minute
the red queen begins creepy and it stays stunning to the last second
overall this is one of the films that i cannot find enough words of praise for
the red queen kills seven times is an absolute masterpiece that easily ranks among the finest gialli ever made and a toppriority for every fan of horror andor italian cinema to see
1010
an old family story told to two young girls by their grandfather is brought to life 16 years later as he foretoldbr br people are getting murdered and blood is being spilled and rats are scampering all over and naked bodies are being enjoyedbr br kitty is the suspect but we know she is not the killer
is it franziska
is it evelyn back from death for revenge
is it a plot to steal an inheritance
the color is superb in this thriller from emilio miraglia who only did one other giallo as far as i knowbr br the only thing that spoiled the film was the appearance that several frames were cut out
someone calls the police and suddenly they are there trying to save kitty
once upon a time in a castle two little girls are playing in the garden 's castle
they are sisters
a blonde little girl and a brunette one
evelyn steals kitty 's doll
kitty pursues evelyn
running through long corridors they reach the room where their grandfather sitting on an armchair reads the newspaper
kitty complains about evelyn while evelyn is looking interestedly at a picture hanging on the wall
evelyn begins to say repeatedly i am the red lady and kitty is the black lady
suddenly evelyn grabs a dagger lying nearby and stabs kitty 's doll and then cuts her head
a fight ensues
and evelyn almost uses the dagger against kitty
the grandfather intervenes and the worst is avoidedbr br later on their grandfather tells them the legend related to the picture hanging on the wall in front of them in which a lady dressed in black is stabbing a lady dressed in redbr br a long time ago a red lady and a black lady lived in the same castle
they were sisters and hated each other
one night for jealousy reasons the black lady entered the red lady 's room and stabbed her seven times
one year later the red lady left her grave
she killed six innocent people and her seventh victim was the black lady
once every hundred years the events repeat themselves in this castle and a red lady kills six innocent victims before killing the black lady herself
br br the grandfather ends his tale by saying that according to the legend sixteen years from now the red queen should come again and kill seven times
but he assures them that this is just an old legendbr br sixteen years pass br br this is the very beginning of the film
there are many twists and surprises in the film
it 's better for you to forget about logic and just follow the film with its wonderful colors the gorgeous women the clothes the tasteful decor the lighting effects and the beautiful soundtrackbr br enjoy barbara bouchet sybil danning marina malfatti pia giancaro among other goddesses
there 's a nude by sybil danning lying on a sofa that 's something to dream about
and do n't forget the lady in red kills seven timesbr br if you 've liked la dama rossa check out also la notte che evelyn usc dalla tomba
emilio miraglia 's first giallo feature the night evelyn came out of the grave was a great combination of giallo and gothic horror and this second film is even better
we 've got more of the giallo side of the equation this time around although miraglia does n't lose the gothic horror stylings that made the earlier film such a delight
miraglia puts more emphasis on the finer details of the plot this time around and as a result it 's the typical giallo labyrinth with characters all over the place and red herrings being thrown in every few minutes
this is a definite bonus for the film however as while it can get a little too confusing at times there 's always enough to hold the audience 's interest and miraglia 's storytelling has improved since his earlier movie
the plot opens with a scene that sees two young girls fighting before their grandfather explains to them the legend behind a rather lurid painting in their castle
the legend revolves around a woman called 'the red queen' who legend has it returns from the grave every hundred years and kills seven people
a few years later murders begin to occur br br even though he only made two giallo 's miraglia does have his own set of tributes
it 's obvious that the colour red is important to him as it features heavily in both films and he appears to have something against women called 'evelyn'
he likes castles gothic atmospheres and stylish murders too which is fine by me
miraglia may be no argento when it comes to spilling blood but he certainly knows how to drop an over the top murder into his film and here we have delights involving a volkswagen beetle and a death on an iron fence that is one of my all time favourite giallo death scenes
the female side of the cast is excellent with the stunning barbara bouchet and marina malfatti heading up an eyepleasing cast of ladies that are n't afraid to take their clothes off
the score courtesy of bruno nicolai is catchy and even though it does n't feature much of the psychedelic rock heard in the night evelyn came out of the grave it fits the film well
the ending is something of a turnoff as although miraglia revs up the gothic atmosphere it comes across as being more than a little bit rushed and the identity of the murderer is too obvious
but even so this is a delightfully entertaining giallo and one that i highly recommend to fans of the genre
this interesting giallo boosts a typical but still thrilling plot and a really sadistic killer that obviously likes to hunt his victims down before murdering them in gory waysbr br directed by emilio p miraglia who one year earlier also made the very interesting la notte che evelyn usci della tomba the film starts off a little slow but all in all no time is wasted with unnecessary sub plots or sequencesbr br this film is a germanitalian coproduction but it was released in germany on video only in a version trimmed by 15 minutes of plot under the stupid title horror house
at least the murder scenes which will satisfy every gorehound are fully intact and the viewer still gets the killer 's motive at the end
but the italian version containing all the footage is still the one to look for of coursebr br a convincing giallo with obligatory twists and red herrings la dama rossa uccide sette volte is highly recommended to giallo fans and slightly superior to miraglia 's above mentioned other thriller
what a fun movie
if you 're a giallo fan red queen kills 7 times is a real winner
to begin with it 's hard to go wrong with barbara bouchet and marina malfatti in the same giallo
both are wonderful especially the wideeyed innocent bouchet as the guilt ridden woman fearing for her life
the kill scenes in red queen kills 7 times are especially nice and feature enough blood to make most fans happy
one of the first murders comes rather unexpectedly and really gets the movie off to a good start
the killer the red queen is one of the most overthetop and interesting looking murderers i 've seen in an italian movie
the 70s sets and fashions are wonderful
in fact all the visuals are interesting with the laughing red queen running across the bridge at night being one of my favorite moments in the film
the convoluted plot held my interest throughout
finally bruno nicolai 's score may be the best i 've heard from the composer
the main theme is so memorable i have n't been able to get it out of my head for two daysbr br the only two issues i have with red queen kills 7 times come in the film 's finale
first the person responsible for the murders is far too easy to spot
if you 've seen more than a couple gialli you wo n't have any problem determining who is behind the killings
second the ending feels a little too rushed and as a result is a bit confusing
i'm definitely not one who needs every plot point spelled out to me but i 'll admit to being at a loss to explain it all
a second viewing might just clear this up
when i saw the elaborate dvd box for this and the dreadful red queen figurine i felt certain i was in for a big disappointment but surprise surprise i loved it
convoluted nonsense of course and unforgivable that such a complicated denouement should be rushed to the point of barely being able to read the subtitles let alone take in the ridiculous explanation
these quibbles apart however the film is a dream
fabulous ladies in fabulous outfits in wonderful settings and the whole thing constantly on the move and accompanied by a wonderful bruno nicolai score
he may not be morricone but in these lighter pieces he might as well be so
really enjoyable with lots of colour plenty of sexiness some gory kills and minimal police interference
super
another good stooge shortchristine mcintyre is so lovely and evil and the same time in this oneshe is such a great actressthe stooges are very good and especially shemp and larrythis to is a good one to watch around autumn time
of the elements that make this the best at this point i have to say is christine mcintire
shemp 's scene when poisoned and her reaction are truly magnificent
i imagine that as one poster suggested christine was trying to hold back laughter during that scene but it actually made her seem even more deliciously evil to be smiling at shemp 's possibly dyingbr br another character who helps this stand out is the goon
his look was a great cross between horrific and comedic goofball
hardly a character i would choose to meet in a dark alley or for that matter anywhere
i would have preferred a bit of true whodunit mystery in this but hey when a short is this good who 's going to complain
not i
one of the very best three stooges shorts ever
a spooky house full of evil guys and the goon challenge the alert detective agency 's best men
shemp is in top form in the famous inthedark scene
emil sitka provides excellent support in his mr goodrich role as the target of a murder plot
before it 's over shemp 's trusty little shovel is employed to great effect
this 16 minute gem moves about as fast as any stooge 's short and packs twice the wallop
highly recommended
this is apparently one of shemp 's first shorts with the stooges
but the threesome 's comedic timing is at its honed best here
aside from the intense slapstick scenes there are others more subtle but just as funny
watch larry when shemp asks him to look at the camera for a snapshot
or watch the real object prompting moe 's exclamation oh highly polished mahogany
br br emil sitka is at his bewildered goofiest
and the goon may look scary but he 's somehow funny
he seems as frustrated and perplexed with the stooges as are regular people in other shortsbr br for shemp aficionados this is a must have episode
it wo n't disappoint
an ultranervous old man mr goodrich terrorized by the news that a gang is stalking the city and prominent citizens are disappearing really panics when someone throws a rock through his window with a message tied to it saying you will be next
br br he calls the detective agency wondering where are the guys he asked for earlier
of course it 's the stooges who could n't respond because had come into the office robbed them and tied them up
some detectives
the moment poor mr goodrich hangs up the phone and says i feel safer already a monstertype goon named nico appears out of a secret panel in the room and chokes him unconscious
we next find out that his trusted employees are anything but that
now these crooks have to deal with the detectives that are coming by the house for mr goodrichbr br some of the gags like moe and larry 's wrinkles are getting a bit old but some of them will provoke laughs if i see them 100 times
i always laugh at shemp trying to be a flirt as he does here with mr goodrich 's niece in a classic routine with a long accordionlike camera lens
the act he puts on when he 's poisoned is always funny too
shemp was so good that i did n't mind he was taking the great curly 's placebr br larry moe curlyshemp were always great in the chase scenes in which monsters or crooks or both are chasing them around a house
that 's the last six minutes in here
at times such as this film
who done it
contains many surefire laughs and gags
it is not only one of the best stooges films with shemp it is one of the finest short comedies columbia produced
director bernds originally wrote the screenplay in 1946 for the stooges but when curly howard suffered a careerending stroke it was tailored for the columbia comedy team of schilling and lane it obviously was too good for the stooges to pass up and it was finally filmed by the stooges at the end of 1947br br old man goodrich calls ace detectives shemp larry and moe out of fear that he will be murdered
when they arrive at his home goodrich has disappeared and his niece and assorted goons try to get rid of the stooges
will they find goodrich and bring the niece and goons to justice
br br shemp is particularly funny in this film
his reactions after being given a mickey by christine mcintyre are superb he gives his trademark sound and miss mcintyre is noticeably trying not to laugh
other funny scenes the closeup of moe 's mug looking through the camera lens and the inthedark fight with all cast members involvedbr br nikko the goon is one of the most unusual looking characters ever portrayed in a stooges film
with his kinked hair he could almost pass for a stooge if he did n't tower over everyone else
who done it
is a gem among the stooges films with shemp
even diehard curly fans will enjoy this one
a true stooge classic
9 out of 10
busy phillips put in one hell of a performance both comedic and dramatic
erika christensen was good but busy stole the show
it was a nice touch after the smokers a movie starring busy which wasnt all that great
if busy doesnt get a nomination of any kind for this film it would be a disaster
forget mona lisa smile see home room
i liked this movie a lot
it really intrigued me how deanna and alicia became friends over such a tragedy
alicia was just a troubled soul and deanna was so happy just to see someone after being shot
my only complaint was that in the beginning it was kind of slow and it took awhile to get to the basis of things
other than that it was great
when i was told of this movie i thought it would be another chick flick
i was wrong
this movie sends a powerful message about judging others
i was deeply moved
everyone i have encountered i have recommended this movie to
no one has come back saying it was bad
busy also did a great job with her role in this film
i do n't know much about her acting career but wow they way she pulled off the end of this fill was greatbr br at the beginning it was a little slow
but after she went to the hospital wow the movie picks up again
i have no idea why this movie has n't been spoken of in the movie world
my wish would be for this movie to be released again and advertised more because it sends a powerful message in a mere hour and a half
home room was a great movie if you 've ever had drama in your life
it keeps you wanting to see more
wondering what the secret alicia is hiding
i think i watched that movie 6 times in a row and never lost interest
plus i usually do n't cry over movies but this one made me cry each time
i wish i could find more movies like that one
all in all i thought it was a great movie
the more you watch of it the more you become part of it
the very end is the part that really got me when she cried when getting her diploma because it had her daughter 's name on it
my heart felt as if it had shattered just then
and how her new friend came to comfort her when she had n't gotten hers yet
i loved it so much
just finished watching this movie for maybe the 7th or 8th time picked it up one night previously viewed at blockbuster and absolutely loved it i 've shown it to 4 people so far and they have enjoyed it as well
avoid of all the hollywood glamour special effects and stress on the shock factor this independent film by paul f ryan hits the nail on the head in dealing with the after affects of traumatic situations
taking place after a high school shooting two characters alicia and deanna form an unlikely bond
alicia the girl with the stone heart the goth who has a pessimistic attitude to life assists deanna to overcome the issues of life and death and living in the aftermath
meanwhile deanna attempts to help alicia to see some of the softness and light in the world again
not stressing on the shocking event of the shooting but on the interpersonal relationships amongst those who survived it sets this movie apart
despite its lowbudget and short filming time this movie is far from cheesy
ryan pays respect to a situation he has never endured and attempts to delve into the human psyche
with an amazing up and coming actress philipps adds the necessary dramatics to the dialogue and overall feel for the film and christensen helps to balance out the doom and gloom feeling this movie may have
overall i recommend this movie and if you enjoy the topic of school aggression and violence and learning more about it i also suggest the documentary it 's a girls world put out by cbc in 2004 which deals with the topic of social bullying comparing and contrasting two groups of girls one in montreal quebec and the other in victoria british columbia the group of friends and acquaintances of dawn marie wellesley a 14 year old girl who killed herself after being brutally bullied
it breaks my heart that this movie is not appreciated as it should be
its very underrated
people forgot what movies are really about nowadays they only think about bum bum movies which can be quite fun watching with popcorn and friends like transformers movies which are oriented with hyper mega high budget like 300mln or even higher on special effects only and which are dumb movies without storyline
its the kind of a movie what i despite most
of course it is fun watching greatly made cgis but we do not gain anything essential from that kind of moviesbr br i honestly think that performance was excellent
especially busy philipps alongside with erika christensen and victor garber made this movie an oscar worth
emotional performance by busy philipps was astonishing its such a shame we wont see oscar in her hands which she deserves
i'm from belgium and therefore my english writing is rather poor sorry for that br br this is one of those little known movies that plays only once on tv and than seems to vanishes into thin air
i was browsing through my old vhs video collection and came across this title i looked it up and it had an imdb score of more than 710 that 's pretty decentbr br i must admit that it 's a very well put together movie and that 's why i'm puzzled
this is the only film made by this director
how come he did n't make lots of films after this rather good one
someone with so much potential should be forced to make another movie ha ha br br anyway i really would like to see that he pulls his act together and makes another good movie like this one please
if you get it it 's magnificentbr br if you do n't it 's decentbr br please understand that getting it does not necessarily mean you 've gone through a school shooting
there is so much more to this movie that at times the school shooting becomes insignificantbr br above all it 's a movie about acceptance both superficiallyof a traumatic event but also of people who are different for whatever reasonbr br it 's also a movie about unendurable pain and how different people endure it
in this case the contrast between alicia 's rage and deanna 's obsession creates an atmosphere of such palpable anxiety that halfway through the movie we wonder how the director could possibly pull a happy ending out of his hat
thankfully the audience is given credit for being human beings our intelligence is not insulted by a sappy implausibly moralistic endingbr br above and beyond that i try to keep a clear head about movies being fiction and all that
yet i must admit i cried like a lost little baby during this movie
there were certain things about it that hit very close to home and opened up some old wounds that never quite healed
but that is not necessarily a bad thing
my children just happened to stop at this movie the other night and as things started to play out it really piqued my interest
i had to head out for bowling league so i had them record it for me on the dvr so i could watch the rest later
well i just got done watching it and the front of my shirt must be soaked after crying buckets
it was an excellent movie even though i could almost feel the pain and anguish these girls were experiencing
and i never in a million years would have guessed the reason why alissia had gone from this beautiful girl to an antisocial goth
this was probably why my shirt was soaked because i 've experienced that same pain that alissia was feeling
i too would not have sought out this movie but i'm sure glad i saw it
very moving very touching
great for those who love a good drama or tearjerker
busy is so amazing
i just loved every word she has ever done freaks and geeks dawson 's creek white chicks the smokers
after the first time i saw home room i went and got it the next day
i am a big fan of her and she has a lot of fans here in israel
if someone has n't saw is excellent movie than do n't waist more time and go see it now
i recommend to all of you to see all of her movies
i saw busy in the late night show with conan and she was so beautiful and cute i just love her
everybody who saw the movie in home room she looks very scary but in real life she is so beautiful
you have to see all her half nude pictures for stuff magazine she looks so good there
danielle
this movie is incredible
if you have the chance watch it
although a warning you 'll cry your eyes out
i do every time i see it and i own it and have watched it many times
the performances are outstanding
it deals with darkness and pain and loss but there is hope
this movie made me look at the world differently vicarious experience according to my english teacher
also if you 've seen it note the interesting use of shadows and light
home room is a phenomenal movie and i rate it 1010 for real because of the excellent acting amazing plot and heartwrenching dialogue
very tense very moving
does n't give all the answers but makes many good points about humankind
home room really surprised me
in comparison to other movies that were written regarding columbine high school this one is the best
home room does not show the school shooting but rather the aftermath and the effects of the community and the town
the movie focus' on two opposite characters alecia and deanna
alecia is an outcast who witnessed the entire shooting
she seems to show no emotion about it
deanna is a popular girl and the only surviving victim
alecia is forced to visit deanna at the hospital in order to graduate
meanwhile the police are investigating alecia as she might have known the shooting was going to happen
alecia and deanna are very different and do not get along at first
eventually they develop a mutual understanding for one another and become friends
home room beautifully shows the power of closeness and turmoil after a school shooting
i would recommend this film to anyone and everyone
home room deals with a columbinelike highschool shooting but rather than hashing over the occurrence itself the film portrays the aftermath and what happened to the survivors their trauma guilt and denialbr br spoilers the shooting itself is treated as a foregone conclusion with no action footage other than the reaction of an almost teenage swat commando after shooting the high school killer
the film has three protagonists the detective investigating the crime of which no guilty parties are left to convict and two teenage girls surviving the incident played by a very young erika christensen and busy philippsbr br the two girls having nothing in common besides the shooting are put together because of it and the drama ensuesbr br erika christensen though only 24 has been around the block so much that film viewers are pretty much acquainted with her solid and reliable style of acting
busy philipps three years older than christensen and altogether unknown to me blew me away with her overwhelming dramatic strength and screen presence
this girl was the partbr br it 's a great movie and it connects to you with its intimate focus on the fragile yet growing relationship between the two traumatized girls
gus van sant 's elephant though good seems almost superficial and paltry compared to home room when it comes to dramatic flair and acting
what i can see this film got very little screen time and exposure so much more a loss for an equally traumatized americabr br ten out of ten
at first i was n't sure if i wanted to watch this movie when it came up on my guide so i looked it up on imdb and thought the cover looked pretty cool so i thought i would give it a try expecting a movie like elephantbr br once i got past the fact that i am supposed to dislike the alicia character played excellently by busy phillips i realized what a good job this movie was doing toward setting up the relationship between alicia and deanna
alicia is so mean to deanna played by erika christensen almost throughout the entire movie but we eventually find out that they despite being polar opposites they have one thing in common besides being present at the shooting
they share loneliness and to what extent is revealed as the film progressesbr br i 've just got to say how much i loved this movie and was glad to see all of the positive comments about it
i could n't even get through elephant because it just seemed to be exploiting the columbine tragedy
this movie on the other hand was compelling and realistic
busy phillips acting is off the chain
that is a good thing and i would love to see her progress into some more mature roles
this is one of the most amazing stories i have ever seen
br br if this film had been directed by larry clark then this story about a school shooting probably would have been shown through the eyes of the killer and whatever led that person to go insane in the first placebr br instead the plot focuses mainly on the aftermath of a school shooting and how it effected the victims who survivedbr br i had seen busy phillips in other films before but her performance in this movie is by far her best
the only other movie that i 've seen with erika christensen is swim fan which made me almost not want to watch this film but she turned in a very good performance herselfbr br this is one of the few movies i have seen that was actually able to make me cry
trust me when i tell you that does n't happen very oftenbr br home room is a beautiful film and that 's all there is too it
i have to say that this is one of the best movies i have ever seen
i was bored and looked through the tv
and found home room and it was already in about 5 min but i got hooked
it was so interesting and moving
it shows what can happen in anyone 's life
i give it a 10 more if possible
the director writer and actors did an amazing job
i think teens should watch this movie and will learn from it
it was great drama mystery and more
i cried for hours
i think that the director writer should write more movies like this one
i loved it
i did n't even know about this movie which is sad because it was so good
i wish it could go in the movies for more people to see
caught the tail end of this movie channel surfing through the cable movie channels and was so intrigued i sought out the next showingbr br i really did n't know what to expect after reading the program summary but i came away from this movie feeling quite disturbed and distressed
it also gave me as adult who attended high school in the 80 's a little better insight into what our kids have to contend with these daysbr br the fact that you do n't see the shooting only adds to the chillness of the plot
to see both child and adult alike struggle to comprehend and come to terms with the senseless shootings was at times overwhelming
and will admit that i shed quite a few tears throughoutbr br on the whole not a movie that i would seek out to what however i am sure glad i did see it
while i was the video store i was browsing through the one dollar rentals and came upon this little gem
i do n't know what it was about it but i just had a gut instic about it and wow was i ever rightbr br the story centers around two girls who have just survived a school shooting
one of the girls is alicia a teenage reble who is the only witness for the full attack and another is deanna another survivor who survived a bullet to the head by some miracle
thrown together by fate they slowly begin a painful and beautiful display of healing and moving onbr br i just hate it when amazing movies fall through the cracks
because wow what a performance by busy phillips and erkia christensen not to mention the rest of the cast
my only complaint is that the dvd was sorely lacking in special features
oh and some of the jump cuts in the movie were kind of jarring
but all in all a excellent movie
home room like zero day and elephant was inspired by the recent wave of school shootings
but unlike the other two films home room focuses on two survivors in the aftermath of a shooting
making it less exploitive and more useful because little effort is wasted in asking questions for which there are no answersbr br do n't give up on this little film during the first 20 minutes it is supposed to set up the real story but plays like a rejected hill street blues episode
it is lame but bear with it at least it pads the running length enough to get the film classified as a feature
i recommend skipping this entirely and just jumping ahead to the hospital scenesthere is nothing here that you ca n't pick up from the remainder of the filmbr br like a lot of good little films this was creatively a oneman show as paul f ryan was both the writer and the director
while this arrangement does not guarantee a good film it is usually a good sign because it will mean a certain unity of construction and execution that is often lacking in big budget dramatic features
because the script of home room is its real strength it is fortunate that the writer also executed the production and insured that his vision made it onto the screenbr br ryan takes a huge chance with the ending which tests the limits of the average viewer 's sentimentality tolerance
he runs it right up to the edge but against all logic leaves you crying instead of cringing
why the ending works is some combination of the audience need for a reward at the end of this kind of journey the song he goes out on and the amazing editing of the final minutebr br the other strength of the film is the casting of busy phillips and erika christensen as the main protagonists
although phillips plays her standard alienated surly teen and christensen her intelligent daughter of a good family they both bring more intensity to their roles than ever before
the family life of both girls is more than satisfactory and of little interest to ryan
what is happening here is all about the two of them despite a lame side story about a police detective wondering around town trying to tie alicia to the lone shooter
if they ever recut and trim the film this side story should be condensedbr br a story about two extremely disparate girls bonding and helping each other is hardly a novel idea and ryan could have easily steered this film into clich and predictability
but instead his script has them engaging in a fascinating and convincing sparring match slowly chipping away at each other and sharing moments of vulnerability only to retreat back inside themselves
deanna 's i'm dying inside line just tears you aparti ca n't think of a moment in any other film that i felt as intensely as that one
she desperately needs a connection that alicia just as desperately resists
deanna only makes progress when she retreats
the viewer keeps expecting the group hug that never seems to happenbr br ultimately this not only generates a lot of suspense but leaves you admiring both characters and the two actresses who brought them to lifebr br then again what do i know
i'm only a child
alright this film is the representation of several things
for starters this film is about a disgruntled student who brings a gun to school and shoots roughly 9 students
one student survives and is in the hospital with extensive head injuries
the lead character is what several people who consider a 'lonergoth' despite the movie 's stating of her not being so
she seems quite mysterious but was also the only unharmed student in the victimized classroom
she 's questioned due to having a history of knowing the shooter and having a record of being on the phone with him the night before
anyhow she 's a very brief and distant person who seems to despise society
yet due to some at first unexplained events she spent roughly a year out of school failing the grade
she has the desire to graduate and the principle practically cons her into the only possible way she can pass is to spend time with the survivor the girl in the hospitalbr br these two leads are nearly entirely opposite and they are quite that on a social level
while alisha is a quiet inwardly disturbed antisocial 'goth' girl who spends her time entirely alone the other girl is a rich popular 'bubbly' girl who seems always incredibly optimistic and trapped in her own fantasy world ignoring the outside world and its realism to survive
i feel both of these roles to a marvelous job of representing most 'cliques' in the modern highschool but more importantly shows how two entirely opposite girls who know nothing of each other eventually open to each other
while the injured girl learns a deep meaningful truth on her once sheltered life and the outside world alisha learns that complete abandonment of society and locking everything inside is not always the best thingbr br many people will look to the connection between these two girls and see one of two things
either a snobby hateful girl who wants he rest of the world to suffer as she does taking it out on an innocent girl or the story of a seemingly trapped fantasized girl who meets an outcast to society and learns not only not to judge but that she is actually perhaps one of the most intelligent people she 's known
in other words people may see this film as a focus on alisha teaching the other girl a lesson about life but it is n't about thatbr br this film is about several things
while it is about all i have stated it is also representative of how people deal from a large lifechanging catastrophe
truly this movie is not very symbolic but instead incredibly straight forward with its message as long as you are n't afraid to open your mind and your heart to some emotions you may not be familiar with being portrayed so miraculouslybr br overall this film is one of the best i 've ever seen
the acting is brilliant the storyline and representation is deep and meaningful and the emotion flowing throughout this film will have anyone not only relating but possibly crying
this film is by far heartwrenching and very impactful and if i ever believed any film could alter a person 's life this would be the first that could have changed minebr br i adored this movie if you ever want a movie that 's moving and impactful while incredibly entertaining and real watch this
i absolutely loved this movie
i bought it as soon as i could find a copy of it
this movie had so much emotion and felt so real i could really sympathize with the characters
every time i watch it the ending makes me cry
i can really identify with busy phillip 's character and how i would feel if the same thing had happened to mebr br i think that all high schools should show this movie maybe it will keep people from wanting to do the same thing
i recommend this movie to everybody and anybody
especially those who have been affected by any school shootingbr br it truly is one of the greatest movies of all time
this movie is so misunderstood it is not even funny
if you think of seeing this one for the shootings stay clear
this one deals with the effects and trauma that the survivors must endure
even the detectives are seeking the answer we all do why
fantastic acting from the two leading ladies as we see how those we ignore are affected by the very same things we are affected with
yes the language is harsh at times but it suits the characters well
there are some loose ends left or unanswered but all movies have these
the major issues are dealt with and this movie makes a major statement about how all of us adults feel after such major incidents
highly recommended for teens and adults
this is paul f ryan 's first and only fulllength feature
he has n't done anything since
however he managed to get an amazing ensemble cast to portray the characters of his story
i do n't know when or why the idea emerged in his head but ryan wrote a screenplay which later became his own directed movie home roombr br busy philipps carries the movie on her shoulders as alicia a troubled girl the ones we always see in television series
with dark hair and black clothes a package of cigarettes in the pocket weird look and disturbing eyes
an event has occurred at her school a shooting
some students have died and she saw everything
now detective martin van zandt is investigating the case and as expected alicia is a suspect
but the shooting is just the genesis the movie is not about the shootingbr br lying in bed in a hospital room is deanna cartwright
she is one of the survivors of the hospital
the script establishes a bond between them by the school principal
he is helping all the students to recover from the event but alicia does n't seem to care
she 's isolated
so the principal punishes her she needs to visit deanna every day until five o' clock
then the movie startsbr br i ca n't even describe how wonderfully written i think the movie is
i can identify with the characters and the situations they live i like reality
these things could happen to anyone
and the things they say are totally understandable
they 're growing up and trying to deal with things they have n't experienced they 're doing their best
without knowing it alicia and deanna are commencing a journey of that will define their personalities and ideas for the next step in life after high schoolbr br the director leads christensen and philipps through their roles very well
look the contrast between them
deanna seems naive and with plain thoughts no complexity inside of her mind
when alicia enters her room and sees tons of flowers she asks who has brought them
many people deanna answers although some days later we learn they 're from her parents who come every week
the parental figures are all well represented but are not as important as their sons' characters
deanna is lonely
alicia seems mature and violent smoking cigarettes and talking roughly
but after two days of visiting she finds herself coming back to the hospital every day even sleeping in deanna 's room all night
when they both have a fight afterwards i believe deanna says why do you keep coming back
alicia is lonely toobr br the ending of the movie without ruining it comes a bit disappointing it 's something i was n't waiting for
it eliminates some of the strength the movie has
the revelation comes totally unnecessary ruining the logical climax the movie could have had
it was an excellent script anyway and an excellent direction
a damn fine moviebr br when it comes to erika christensen this was the role she needed to fly higher
her role in traffic was impressing but this was the big step the main role
maybe not many had the chance to see her in this film and that 's a pity
she has n't made one false move since then
she has even come out with good performances in awful movies
on the other hand busy philipps who proved to be very promising in this movie has n't got many opportunities for other rolesbr br the same i say about paul f ryan and i expect he is sitting now in his computer finishing his new script i'm waiting for his next movie
i'm hoping the best for all of them
this film is n't just about a school shooting in fact its never even seen
but that just adds to the power this film has
its about people and how they deal with tragedy
i know it was shown to the students who survived the columbine shooting and it provided a sense of closure for a lot of them
the acting is superb
all three main actors are excellent in their roles i highly recommend this film to anyone
its one of those films that makes you talk about it after you see it
it provokes discussion of not only school shootings but of human emotions and reactions to all forms of tragedy
it is a tearjerker but it is well worth it and one i will watch time and time again
home room came as a total surprise
not having a clue as to what it was all about it paid off big time because it does n't hold any punches and what we see is how lives are changed by the act of a disgruntled young man who decided to victimize his class mates who are the innocent victims of his rash actionsbr br paul ryan the director who is working and editing his own material is a talented man who is rewarded by some amazing acting all around by his castbr br alicia browning is an older girl who is trying to graduate high school
she has been away a couple of years and does n't seem to be in the same wave length of the other students
for one she is a rebel with a punk look lots of makeup and a mouth that will cut anyone who dares to come near her orbit
alicia was among the students in the home room where nine students have died supposedly killed by her boyfriend
alicia we realize is a wounded girl who has gone through a terrible ordeal in her life but we are not given any clues to that effectbr br what follows is the aftermath of the tragedy as it concentrates on a young woman who has survived it
deanna cartwright is a wealthy teen ager who should n't have been at the school at all
when a ricochet bullet hit her she is hospitalized with more than a wound
she is trying to get over this dark period in her mind but the nightmares do n't let her forgetbr br alicia is made to go to the hospital by the school principal
since she does n't cooperate with the police the head of the school wants her to see deanna in her terrible state and perhaps she will soften up and will tell the authorities what she knows
alicia dislikes deanna but in a matter of days both girls will make peace
we do n't realize until the last sequence what really happened that horrible day in schoolbr br busy phillips makes an excellent alicia and erika christiansen is equally good as deanna
victor garber james pinkins taylor holland and the rest of the cast play as an ensemblebr br the film has an intensity because it 's not explicit in showing how the shootings occurred which helps the tone that mr ryan wanted to give this movie
the industry dropped the ball on this
the trailer does not do the movie justice and when this opened it was on a hand full of screens
had people had an opportunity to see this work of mouth would have made it very successful
the 2 lead actresses each give great emotional performances that really draw you in to the story and especially the characters
i checked this out based on the rave recommendation richard roeper or in his book
an example of a great film that never got fully released except on a few screens
which gave it no chance to be seen
some movies go to video quickly because they are n't that good
this is oscar worthy and it 's a tragedy on many levels that most will never even hear of it
maybe via word of mouth it will gain a following on dvd or cable
if you have n't see this movie you should
great performances of the 2 lead actresses make this movie
it could have just been another formulaic teen movie after school special but instead it stands up well to other note worthy films
girl interrupted comes to mind
if you like that you will like this
br br both girls are in one amazing emotional scene after another without coming off as melodramatic
even though alicia is angry and deanna is crying through most of the movie it is done is such a real way that they do not come off as stereotypical characters or as melodramatic
the movie will move you in many scenes and if you are an aspiring actor use these real performances as your school
erica is even better in this than in traffic
i hope both of these actors get more roles that utilize their talents as well and let them shine
see this movie and if you like recommend to friends so it does n't get lost among all the blockbuster crap that comes out every year
this movie was buried while spiderman 2 tops records
what kind of word are we living in
aghhh
so to make the world right again see this and recommend it
why a stupid boring crappy overrated film series like star wars gets all the hype and a truly amazing film like this one goes completely unnoticed is beyond me this movie will really open your eyes to the dark disturbing sad and scary world we live in br br unlike the boring elephant this movie is n't one of those just a typical day until someome pulls the trigger movies this movie focuses more on what happens after the event br br deana played by the very hot and very talented erika christensen is a happy and healthy straighta student with great friends and a great life until she is injured on the day of the shooting by being shot in the head luckily she is not killed but is severely injured and has to be in the hospital for a while causing her to be in a lot of emotional pain in addition to the physical br br meanwhile alicia played by the also very gorgeous and talented busy phillips is a nasty coldhearted rebellious antisocial goth girl who does n't have a single positive trait on her and she is unharmed when the shooting happens because it turns out she was friends with the shooter and knew he was going to do what he did which causes her to be brought into the police station and be asked some questions when she refuses to tell the cops if she knew the shooting was going to happen they constantly come by her house to try to convince her to say something and she still does n't so the principal of the school makes her attend a funeral of one of the dead students and after she walks out on that the principal decides enough is enough and forces her to go visit deana in the hospital of course she refuses this too but the principal says that if alicia does n't do this the cops are going to continue to try to get her to say something and so she actually goes to see her br br the lonely traumatized and both physically and emotionally wounded deana is more than happy to have someone visit her but of course alicia is anything but happy to be seeing her deana attempts to give her a friendly welcome but of course alicia responds with nothing but harsh and hurtful comments and a harsh statement on how she is only here because she is being forced and has no intention of being friendly with her at all
but sooner or later that intention will change this is truly one of the most moving movies ever as well as one of the most dark and disturbing actually i think i would tie this with american history x as equally disturbing and moving at the same time br br warning watch this movie at your own risk
it contains very graphic scenes and images
excellent and criminally underappreciated movie
i feel so ashamed that i'm pretty much the only one that knows about it
i was up late flipping cable channels one night and ran into this movie from about 10 minutes into the start every time i even thought going to bed something kept on telling me to keep on watching it even though it was way way way past my bedtimebr br this movie could have been another easy slam dunk antigun film but instead they chose to examine the aftereffects of the shootings
and even better the movie kept on with the real life just when you think they are going to take the easy and obviously contrived way out a twist comes along and changes the whole outlook of the movie
this film not only does n't follow the formula it shows how other events often lead up to andor affect what happens afterwardsbr br i only wish the filmmakers had explored the issues around antidepressant drugs more the kids from columnbine who did the shootings were on them for years and it was frightening to watch the way deanna popped them every time the nightmares started
up until recently they were dispensing the stuff like candy and only now do they even begin to understand what long term effects the drugs have
it was very refreshing to see that the mental illness aspect of the story was given quite a bit of film having a relative who suffers from a mental illness i can say that the movie was dead nuts on in every aspect of mental illnesses
bravo to the director and writer who obviously did their homework on those issues
and for those who think certain things could n't happen in a hospital you 're dead wrong on that too i 've been there
the script was so real it was amazingbr br go buy this film and show it to your teenage kids before it 's too late
someday they 'll thank you for it
what a surprise two outstanding performances by the lead actresses in this film
this is the best work busy phillips has ever done and the best from erika christensen since traffic
this film certainly should be in oscar contention
see this movie
i could n't believe the comments made about the moviebr br as i read the awful opinions about the movie i actually wondered if you had actually viewed the same movie that i didbr br what i viewed was incredible
i think the actresses and director did a fantastic job in the moviebr br i had n't had the pleasure to see either actress previously and i could n't have been more set back by the incredible job that they did i 'd have to say its the most believable movie that i 've seen in a long time
br br what i do n't see is why everyone has such a problem with deanna 's choice of drug in the attempt of suicide scene from the comments made you sound like it was the actresses choice and her stupid choice
that i do n't understand its a movie written by someone else and directed by someone else so how it can be the actresses error i fail to see
i think it was a real believable movie that i would see again and recommend
opinions are what the are and its too bad that so many are so close minded
i hope to see any of the actors soon i think that all played great rolesbr br busy philipps will be the highest paid actress someday and i hope she can laugh in the face of everyone that criticized her
you go girl
i just recently watched this 1954 movie starring vincent price for the first time on turner classic movies
price portrays don gallico a magicianinventor who is driven to murder when his boss steals several of his magical inventions
even though price is a murderer i actually found myself rooting for him he is a sympathetic character who is driven mad by the greedy people around him who keep taking advantage of himbr br although this movie does n't have the horror factor of some of his more famous roles it nonetheless has enough going for it to keep the viewers interest
br br this is a must for vincent price fans
this is essentially a variation on house of wax in both the plot and the type of role played by the star of both movies vincent pricein both pictures he plays a talented artist who is sent toppling over the edge into insanity when his creations are usurped by otherless talented and less scrupulous people in this movie he plays a designer of illusions for stage magicians who aspires to set out on a performing career himself only to be frustrated when another illusionist the great rinaldo insists that he honour his contract and give him first choice of any illusions he designsprice is already ill disposed towards rinaldi as his former wife is now a paramour of rinaldi
he deploys his talents as an illusionist and as a brilliant mimic to avenge himself upon rinaldi and others who thwart his plans for recognition as a performer and a designerbr br price is pretty much the whole show here and gives a well judged star turn as a wronged man whose predicament earns audience sympathythe rest of the cast are competent if colourless and the weight of the whole venture falls on price who carries the burden with ease br br good solid b movie melodrama this is a crime movie rather than a horror picture and is enjoyable providing you do n't expect a masterpiece shot in black and white it is low on gore and is best seen as melodrama and enjoyed for the presence of its star giving an idiosyncratic performance
basically the exact same movie as house of wax vincent price 's first genuine horror hit released the previous year but seriously who cares because the mad magician offers just as many sheer thrills delightful period setpieces joyous 3d effects sublime acting performances and macabre horror gimmicks as its predecessor
never change a winning team is exactly what writer crane wilbur must have thought when he penned down price 's character don gallico another tormented soul besieged by fate and out for vengeance against those who wronged him
don gallico is about to perform his very first own illusionist show as gallico the great and plans to exhibit the greatest magic trick in history entitled the girl and the buzz saw
gallico 's promising solo career is abruptly ruined before it even begins when his previous employer ross ormond appears on stage and shoves a contract under his nose stating that all of gallico 's inventions are the rightful property of the company
the sleazy and relentless ormond who by the way also ransacked gallico 's once beloved wife takes off with the buzz saw trick and programs it in the show of gallico 's rival the great rinaldi
inevitably gallico snaps and sadistically butchers ormond but also being a master of creating disguises recreates his victim 's image and even starts leading a double life
the mad magician is an amusing and thoroughly unpretentious 50 's horror movie in grand guignol style with a whole lot of improbably plot twists and a handful of fantastically grotesque grossout moments
the 3d delights near the beginning of the film like a yoyo player and a goofy trick with water fountains merely just serve as timefiller and contemporary 50 's hype but it 's still fun to watch even now and without the means to properly behold them
the mad magician is also interesting from a periodical setting point of view as the events take place around the time fingerprints were starting to get used as evidence material and the character of alice prentiss is an obvious reference towards famous crime authors of that era
needless to state that vincent price remains the absolute most essential element of triumph in this film as well as from nearly every other horror movie this legendary man ever starred in
like no other actor could ever accomplish price depicts the tormented protagonist who gradually descends further and further into mental madness in such an indescribably mesmerizing way
you pity don gallico yet at the same time you fear him enormously
you support his vile acts of retaliation and yet simultaneously you realize his murderous rampage must end in death
vincent price simply was a genius actor and in my humble opinion the embodiment of the horror genre
the great vincent price has done many fantastic horror films some of which range among the greatest genre gems of alltime
price 's greatest achievements were doubtlessly his films in the 60s with films such as roger corman 's brilliant poecycle michael reeves' witchfinder general or ubaldo ragona 's the last man on earth marking the ultimate highlights of this brilliant man 's career
the films that made the man famous and thereby made him the immortal horror icon he is however date back to the 50s with house of wax marking his rise to stardom
the mad magician of 1954 follows a plot that is very similar to that of its successful predecessor
this is not to say however that this film is n't an original delightfully macabre and absolutely wonderful gem itself
as the lines above may suggest vincent price is my favorite actor and while i personally would not allow myself to miss anything the man has been in none of my fellow fans of the man may miss this little gembr br price stars as don galico an underrated master magician and inventor of magic devices whose boss a sleazy businessman stole his wife from him
when the boss takes away one of galico 's ingenious inventions and gives it to his rival the great rinaldi galico snaps and a murderous spree of revenge begins br br do n't we love vincent price when he 's out for revenge
some of his most famous and greatest films such as the abominable dr phibes or theater of blood were about absurd and delightfully macabre revenge murders and this earlier film in his horror career is another proof that no one takes revenge as vincent price does
this film provides a wonderfully eccentric leading role for price who as always delivers a brilliant performance and guarantees 70 minutes of outrageously entertaining and macabre fun for every horror fan
another mustsee for my fellow price fans
vincent price 's followup to house of wax the film which cemented his reputation as a horror icon similarly revolves around a bitter albeit resourceful showman
though a remake the former remains the superior effort that said apart from some resistible comic relief the obligatory resort to cheap gimmickry and occasional narrative shortcomings this offers more than enough grand guignoltype thrills and overall camp value to stand on its own two feet
incidentally director brahm 's involvement here proves no mere coincidence since the narrative incorporates elements from two horror titles he had previously helmed ie
the lodger and hangover square
the young leads are played by mary murphy and patrick o'neal
an interesting sideline here is the latter 's adoption of a novel detection technique fingerprinting which is crucial in bringing about price 's downfall though the persistent snooping of his amateur crime novelist landlady has at least as much to do with it in the long run
watching the star in a madetomeasure role the film emerges a good deal of fun particularly at a compact 73 minutes
the film begins with vincent price about to begin his performance as a magician
however midway through the very successful show the police come and shut him down
it seems that his old boss had cheated him out of the tricks price had createdeven those he made on his own time at home
as a result price justifiably kills the evil man
the problem is that while the viewer understood why price killed and most probably thought this was a good thing because price was a bit mad he just could n't stop at one br br the film was full of very creative and spectacular magic tricks great plot twists as well as exciting action
one thing you ca n't say about this film is that it is dull
while it 's also far from subtle it is fun throughout though and well worth a lookbr br had i never seen vincent price 's version of house of wax i probably would have liked the mad magician a lot more and scored it an 8 or 9 that 's because while the mad magician is a wonderful film it 's highly reminiscent of the film that preceded it
the bottom line is that since house of wax was so successful the formula was rehashed in the followup film
both were made in 3d both have a plot where price has every justification to kill but he ca n't stop once he 's committed the first and both are great fun to watch
the biggest differences and there are few are that house of wax was in color and was more of a horror film and the mad magician was definitely more of a mysterybr br my advice is to see this film and house of wax
they are both terrific 1950s horror films
even though it has one of the standard revenge price plots this film is my favorite of vincent price 's work
gallico has that quality that is missing in so many horror film characters likeability
when you watch it you feel for him you feel his frustration the injustices against him and you cheer him on when he goes for vengeance even though he frightens you a little with his original fury
as the film goes on his character becomes tragic
he 's committed his murder but now he must kill to cover that up
and again to cover that one up
and again your stomach sinks with his soul as it goes down its spiral like watching a beloved brother turn into a hood
even if the revenge story is of old the plot devices themselves are original gallico uses his tricks to kill in more and more inventive ways
a shame this one is n't available for home veiwing
i loved the real mc coys it is too bad that lydia reed has decided to be forgotten and not appear
she was excellent in the show
of course walter brennan was great as well as tony martnez
i loved it when he called amos seor grampai have purchased season i on dvd and i cannot wait to buy seasons 26if only there would be more shows on television like this one everything would be better
this show appeared briefly in the summer of 1999 but then disappeared
god bless all the departed members of the cast and pleasellydia reed make yourself known again to the public
you are loved and respected
the real mc coys will live forever
i really enjoyed the reunion a lot
i would have rated it a 10 if they had had hassie and little luke
there was n't even a mention of where they are today or why they did n't participate in the reunion
they were very popular characters and i think it was a mistake not to give an explanation about their lack of appearancebr br anyway i was glad that tnn ran the series again
i had been looking for episodes for years and what a joy to be able to tape the whole series
jenny hanahan
i watched the mccoys reunion and was glad to see richard crenna and kathleen nolan and tony martinez
to see them now was wonderful because i always watched the show growing up so when the tv said that there was going to be a reunion i was so excited
the only thing i could not figure out is why lydia reed and michael winkelman was not on therei know that walter brennan had died
so i got on my computer and tried to find out about them and found this site so if there is anyone out there that can tell me what ever happened to lydia reed and michael winkelman little luke i would be thankful
i have searched everywere and no luck the only thing i could find out about michael winkelman is he was supposed to be born in 1946 this show had value and morals each show gave a lesson to be learnedthe shows today dont have thatthe whole cast was incredable the only thing better than finding out obout them would be to meet them so since that is impossible if there is anyone that can help please do
thank you glenda
fortunately for us real mccoy fans three of the adult actorsactress appeared when they did for the reunion show in 2000 tony martinez and richard crenna both died shortly thereafter
as enjoyable as it was to see luke sugarbabe and pepino together again it was equally mysterious about the complete absence of any mention of lydia reed and michael winkleman
it is my understanding that little luke had passed away in 1999 but i'm not sure how
there is no information about hassie on the internet that i can find
very curious why they were not even mentioned
it was so conspicuous their absence from the reunion show that i suspect that the family of michael and lydia herself either 1 requested to be left out of the discussion and therefore their desire was granted or 2 tnn could not find any trace of either michael or lydia they seemed to have vanished
therefore it would be the safest policy to leave them out of the conversation all togetherbr br otherwise the retrospect on walter brennen was wonderfully done
they made no bones about it it was grandpa who made the show such a success
i remember as a child mimicking grandpa 's gimp walk and my parents laughing
one annoyance that did bother me a bit was the tendency for richard crenna to dominate the discussion at times interrupting tony and kathleen to make a point
in fact although tony martinez seemed completely capable to contribute to the conversation he was not allowed to speakout and say too much during the reunion show
unfortunate since i wanted to hear from all three equally
all in all the reunion show was a real treat for me
i 've watched it on dvd several times and have enjoyed it each timebr br dodgerdude
a few years ago i added a comment to the imdb on the real mccoys tv series
i said then and repeat now it was a charming funny and entertaining show wellacted with wonderful characterizationsbr br i recently saw on dvd four old episodes plus the reunion of 2000 with richard crenna kathy nolan and tony martinez
as another writer here mentioned it is curious that lydia reed and michael winkelman were n't refered to but perhaps they can be tracked down via sag or aftrabr br the reunion show was well done and gave us many unknown insights into the show
one piece of inside information we did not get was whether or not kathy nolan regretted quitting the show in an unpleasant contract dispute which left luke a widow in it 's last year which was n't very good
nolan went on to do a bomb of a comedy called broadside about women nurses in the pacific in ww ii
get it
broadside
no not funnybr br unlike the sleazy salacious and violent trash on tv now that is so undermining our values the real mccoys entertained with decent values and fine human beings
and i thank all involved including the creator irving pinkus for having brought it to my family
we never missed it
i used this film in a religion class i was teaching
the golden fish is swimming happily in his bowl in an upper floor apartment
a young boy and his mother are away from home
the boy has been given money to buy milk
on the way home he stops at carnival to play a game
next to him stands a man in a black suit looking a little scary
the boy drops the bottle of milk
it breaks
the man in the black suit gives him money to replace the milk
this scene alternates with what is happening at home
a black cat climbs the fire escape and enters the apartment
he discovers the fish bowl and watches it
the fish swims energetically and flips out of the bowl
by now a bunch of teenagers in my class and i have fallen in love with the fish
the cat takes the fish in his mouth and we all hold our breath
the cat drops the fish into the bowl
the double story line includes the suspicious man in black and the suspicious black cat
both inspire prejudice
both are innocent
it was a great discussion starter in my class
i saw this film while at birmingham southern college in 1975 when it was shown in combination with the red balloon
both films are similar in their dreamlike quality
the bulk of the film entails a fish swimming happily in his bowl while his new owner a little boy is away at school
a cat enters the room where the fish and his bowl are and begins to warily stalk his prey
the boy begins his walk home from school and the viewer wonders whether he will arrive in time to save his fish friend
the fish becomes agitated by the cat 's presence and finally jumps out of the bowl
the cat quickly walks over to the fish gently picks him up with his paws and returns him to his bowl
the boy returns happily to his fish none the wiserbr br the ending is amazing in both its irony and its technical complexity
it is hard to imagine how the director could 've pulled the technical feat back in 1959 it seems more a trick for 2003br br if you can find it watch it you wo n't be disappointed
and if you do find it let me know so i can get a copy too
i remember seeing this in a the salem movie theater in dayton ohio when i was a young boy and have never forgotten it
it simply amazed me and my friends
i do wish there were some way i could see it again
i have tried to find some compilation of shorts or something like that to no avail
i only recently discovered that it was a cousteau film and that blew my mind even more
how the heck he accomplished this is beyond my understanding
the fish is actually in the cat 's mouth at one point if i remember correctly
if anyone could help me find a way to see it again i would be extremely grateful
this academy award winning short film can rank among the greatest of the genre
told completely without dialogue it is a visual treat about a young boy who buys a gold fish lovingly places him in a bowl then goes off to school leaving the gold fish unprotected and a window carelessly open
after a while a neighboring orange tabby comes poking around comes in through the window and heads slowly for the bowl
the fish apparently knows something is going on and becomes very excited
as the cat comes very near to the bowl the fish jumps out
the cat catches the fish drops him back in the bowl and exits through the window he came in just as the boy not knowing what has happened gets back
this was amazingly filmed with real animals how cousteau got these animals to behave in this manner is remarkable
i only wish this film were available now for people to see i only saw it once in 1959 when it was originally released but it has remained unforgettable
this was one of the best movies i have seen
the movie relates to real life and how drugs can play a major part
although this movie appears to be produced from a low budget i found it to be exhilarating to watchbr br some may not like the story and say the script is lacking direction
however when a person gets as deep into drugs as these characters there is no direction is life
i feel this movie is an accurate representation of what might happen to a person if they are faced with extreme temptationsbr br most of the cast are newcomers to the industry
however they all pulled it off very well
everyone seemed to do their job well and get into character appropriatelybr br i think this movie might be a good tool to use when dealing with a person or loved one that is involved in drugs and appears to be spiraling out of control
this movie might just scare them enough to change their ways
to be honest i had no idea what this movie was about when i started it
that 's how i watch movies whenever possible
no preconception
i thought this was going to be a movie about stoners in the woods or something
i was wrong kindabr br loaded was kind of boring at first but once it started to get going it really hooked me
i know the feeling of being sucked into something dangerous where you feel helpless but to do things that you do not want to dobr br another user commented on how this movie was silly and implausible but i beg to differ
these kinds of things do happen
i'm sorry but not everyone lives in a dream world where nothing bad can happen and crazy situations are implausible
really sorry but the reality of the world is that they do happen
the creator of this movie as well as the actors did a great job of portraying how things can just go bad and how people can make really bad choices
sometimes things turn out good sometimes they turn out bad and such is lifebr br i highly recommend this movie
yeah the poster is quite a horrible piece of workbr br i thought the movie was ok nothing really outstanding i just was hoping that he would be a hardcore druggie and totally trash his lifebr br ahh but that ca n't happen to rich kids now can it
not to the son of a wealthy businessman who holds big ballroom parties and has a nice manicured lawn on the front of the mini mansionbr br no the kid is too good to have his life totally trashed
after all who will drive the brand new suv and who will go to law school
br br ah the poor little rich kids in their quaint pretty house with their ivy league schools ultra clean homes and socialite parties what will the world do without them
br br i hope they all get addicted to drugs passaway their life and end up in jail so maybe we can see movies that do n't all revolve around the poor little rich boys and girls of the surreal world
generally it was a good movie with an ideal ending the acting was spectacular and the characters did n't stray from their persons
i especially liked the plot although you knew what was going to happen it still gave the element of surprise through out the entire movie
however i find that coming on to the ending it could have been a little longer to me it seemed like it was rushed a bit as if the writer was trying to take linens off the lines before the rain fell
for instance what happened to tristan 's brother hayden
for all we know he died in the hospital
maybe he was the one that setup the entire thing
who knows
maybe there will be a sequel
maybe
if there is i cant wait to see it
this is no arthouse film it 's mainstream entertainment
br br lot 's of beautiful people ta and action
i found it very entertaining
it 's not supposed to be intellectually stimulating it 's a fun film to watch
jesse and chace are funny too which is just gravy
definitely worth a rentalbr br so in summary i 'd recommend checking it out for a little friday night entertainment with the boys or even your girl br br the villains are good too
vinnie corey large the hatian guy from heroes
very nasty villains
my first child was born the year this program came out and i played the record album for the boys every christmas thereafter
when the cd came out i bought about ten copies and still give them to friends and relatives as they start families it invariably becomes their favorite christmas album
i recently found several dvd 's for sale on ebay
the one i bought was an excellent copy and it was so great to see the show again after more than 25 years
there are some songs on the show that were not on the album and some of the songs on the album were studio versions of the same songs on the show
but both the cd and dvd will stay in our library as the best christmas entertainment ever
i am a huge john denver fan
i have a large collection of his music on vinyl
i saw this christmas special when it was originally on tv and loved it
i have the original vinyl album and cd
i have the original cd and later release
the later release is missing several songs though
i see that it has been released this year with all original songs
to my surprise i found the original cd for sale at 7500
wow to think that a christmas cd would be worth that much
to me no amount is worth selling this treasure
it is my favorite christmas cd
i have never been able to find it on vhs or dvd
i would love to have either version
if anyone has one available please let me know
thanks
yes i have a copy of it on vhs uncut in great condition that i transfered to dvd and if anyone one wants to bring back the memories of a christmas classic please emil me at dmd2222neti searched everywhere and i found nothing on this and i thought that i cant be the only one on this planet that has this classic on tape there has to be other people and if they do i fit in with them being that very very few that has this classic so i consider myself lucky and i have all of the muppets christmas except one that john denver did with the muppets again i thinks its called a smokey mountain holiday im not to sure but its close
i was reviewing some old vhs tapes i have and came across the tv show john denver the muppets a christmas togetherthis made me go to my computer and look it up to see if i could find a dvd version of this show to buy
i was disappointed not to be able to find it yet on dvd
the show aired in 1979 and was a delightful show
i have the record and the cd but i would love to buy a dvd version of this show
the tape is old and picture quality is pretty good but fading the sound is not as good as the cd
there is also a few other songs not put on the cd
as a fan of john denver and of the muppets a dvd of this show would really be a good seller
if you do n't have the cd it is a wonderful chritmas collection of songs taken from that show
the album is also good if you can find it and still have a record player to play it on
this was a favorite christmas special that i wish that they would release on vhs or dvd since my 33 rpm got lostand any cassettes i made are also long gonebr br i am not even a big john denver fan but was very impressed with the music which was mostly traditional favorites with a muppet spin it also contained a few little known songs br br even though it was done at the end of the '70 's this show had a timeless feel to it
hoping to find a copy soon
for me too this christmas special is one that i remember very fondly
in 1989 i snatched up the 2 cds i found of the soundtrack recording giving one to my sister and keeping the other for myself
it 's part of my family 's christmas tradition now and i would love to be able to actually see the show again rather than just remember it as i listenbr br it has been noted elsewhere that john denver made a number of appearances on the muppet show and they did more than one special together
the good rapport between denver and his fuzzy companions comes through clearly here in a charming and fun show that is good for all ages
a christmas together actually came before my time but i 've been raised on john denver and the songs from this special were always my family 's christmas music
for years we had a crackling cassette made from a record that meant it was christmas
a few years ago i was finally able to track down a video of it on ebay so after listening to all the music for some 21 years i got to see john and the muppets in action for myself
if you ever get the chance it 's a lot of fungreat music heartwarming and cheesy
it 's also interesting to see the 70 's versions of the muppets and compare them to their newer versions today
i believe denver actually took some heat for doing a show like thisi guess normally performers do n't compromise their images by doing singalongs with the muppets but i'm glad he did
even if you ca n't track down the video the soundtrack is worth it too
it has some muppified traditional favorites but also some original denver tunes as well
scott bartlett 's 'offon' is nine minutes of pure craziness
it is a fullfrontal assault of psychedelic pulsating epilepsyinducing flashing lights and colours and the first true merging of film and video in avantegarde cinema
there 's no story to speak of but bartlett uses images of nature particularly the human face and form to provoke a sequence of emotional reactions integrating these biological phenomena into the highlyindustrial form of modern technology
in a sense the film represents the merging of humanity into his tools his machinery his technology
this theme connects loosely with the subplot of hal9000 in stanley kubrick 's '2001 a space odyssey ' and indeed bartlett 's opening sequence of images flashing colours before a closeup human eye recalls dave bowman 's journey through the stargate
the visuals are richlycoloured a confronting blend of sharp vivid photography and increasinglygrainy video as though we 're sitting too close to a television screen br br there appears to be some confusion about the film 's release date
imdb lists the film as a 1972 release but both the national film registry and the national film preservation foundation give 1968 as the correct year
perhaps this disparity reflects the time between the film 's completion and its first public screening
either way the visuals are distinctly ahead of their time occasionally reminiscent of a 1980s music video and some brisk techno music would n't have gone amiss either
'offon' captures grainy fragmented images presenting life from the warped perspective of a computer processing too much information
i had a thought and please do n't laugh at this freethinking interpretation that an extraterrestrial civilisation capturing earth 's television signals might very well receive such a disjointed alien documentation of human life a bizarre montage of only vaguelyfamiliar imagery that could n't possibly make any coherent sense
perhaps this is where mankind with all his technology is eventually heading towards an irreversible merging of film and video of purity and artificiality
imdb lists this as 1972 for some reason but the other sources i 've seen including the excellent program notes mark it as '68
does n't really matter except that it 's quite interesting to watch this abstract collage of film and video in the context of the star gate sequence in 2001 released the same year
pure abstraction is n't really my thing but i can take it in small doses and the supersaturated optically printed colors and psychedelic feel of this series of flowers rohrschach blots birds etc is pretty compelling and quite beautiful
certainly helped paved the way for many other nascent video artists in the 70s and deserves to be better known
i first heard about this film about 20 years ago when i was a kid in grade school it just so happened that i was thumbing through the encyclopedias in the classroom one day and under the entry for movies were several stills for different movies from mainstream to experimental and one of them shown on the page was a still for offon
it really intrigued me since it stood out the most on the page br br about 18 or so years later the public library here where i live had available for checkout the whole 4dvd set of treasures of american film archives released by the national film preservation foundation
so when i was reading the notes on the dvd cases for the set i was quite pleasantly surprised to see that offon was on one of the discs
after all these years i could finally see the film
after viewing it it slightly was n't was i was expecting it to be but it was still an impressive film imho considering the techniques scott bartlett used to make the film including handtinting the film itself and using video equipment for some of the film 's scenes giving it a more distressed lores lookbr br do n't get me wrong the techniques used in this film were quite groundbreaking for 1972 that 's why it 's still one of my favorite shortexperimental films and a creative inspiration for me as well
when i read other commenti decided to watch this movie br br first cast specially michael madsen and tamer karadagli good enough br br filmvery intelligence and interesting because cast have a lot of international specially european actor and actress like from turkey and russsia br br secondstory is basic and you can guess but if you interesting action good play you 'll like in my opinion br br thirdfinal chapter is not special or interestingit 's regular like other action movies br br finallyi recommend to watch this movie and i hope you 'll love it enjoy d
this movie had an interesting cast it mat not have had an a list cast but the actors that were in this film did a good job
im glad we have b grade movies like this one the story is basic the actors are basic and so is the way they execute it you do n't need a million dollar budget to make a film just a mix of b list ordinary actors and a basic plot
i like the way they had the street to themselves and that there was no one else around and also what i though was interesting is that they did n't close down a caf to set there gear and that they did it all from a police station
arnold vosloo and michael madsen did a great job at portraying there roles in the hostage situation
this was a great film and i hope to see more like it in the near future
gotta start with ed furlong on this one
you gotta
god bless this kid
5 bucks says the character he plays in this film is what he 's really like in real life
he has a oneliner or two that made me almost blow snot because of the subtle humor in the script
you know all the trials this guy has gone through in recent years and it does n't even seem like furlong is even acting
maybe that 's why his performance was good
same with madsen
you keep thinking i bet this guy is really like this in real life
does madsen even have to act
just natural
vosloo has obviously moved on from the typecasted mummy guy
i think the biggest surprise to this film was jordana spiro 's performance
her reactions are spoton in this film
i battled if she was hot or not but realized i would just like to see more of her
br br not a big fan of shoot 'em outhostage type films
but what i am a fan of are films with lots of twists and turns to try and keep you guessing
it 's not just your standard robbers take over a bank they kill hostages and the good guys win in the end type of film
the twists keep on coming and comingbr br the caf scenes work best with the handheld cams to show what it 's really like in there
not glossed over a bit
think like bourne ultimatum lite style on some scenes in the cafbr br and for those bo bice fanatics out there actor curtis wayne will make you do a double take
these guys are twinsbr br as i watched i wondered why some of the actors had foreign accents and what were they doing in this small town
made sense in the end that these people smuggled stuff to other countriesstates so they might have these accents
but more is revealed in the bonus features of how some of the producers wanted to make this film for international audiences with some of their stars we might not have heard of
and some of them are smoking hot
moncia dean
need i say more
the first von trier movie i 've ever seen was breaking the waves
sure a nice movie but it definitely stands in the shadow of europa
europa tells a story of a young germanamerican who wants to experience germany just after the second world war
he takes a job that his uncle has arranged for him as a purser on a luxues train
because of his job he travels all through an almost totally destroyed germany meeting with the killing of traitors and hunt for former nazi party members
the society is suffering from corruption
his uncle has narrowed his conciousness by focussing on the job he has also as a purser on the train
by coincidence the main character get involved in bombing and terrorism by a group called 'werewolves' they put pressure on him to help them placing bombs on trains
the atmosphere is astounding
the viewer is taken from scene to scene by a man attempting to put the viewer under hypnosis and then counting to wake you up in a new scene
just when you think you 've seen a lot
europe
lars von triers europa is an extremely good film
how 's that
von trier has a very stylized way to tell a story at least he did have with europa
to me the whole film was like an experience even if i did see it on a small television screen
even with all the tricks in my opinion this film is the most complete real and moving piece of cinema then most of the films on the top 250 list
i also think it is perhaps the scariest the most gothic and complete film around
all right there are other good ones too but this one is my favorite
the final scene is one of the most harrowing scenes ever
europa' is one of the most visually stunning films i have ever seen
the blend of grayscale and colour photography is near seamless a true feast for the eyes
the picture was a contender for a 1991 's golden palm in canners
the award went to barton fink a film stylistically very similar to zentropa
here 's an exercise in class rent both films and be a judge for yourself
this is the movie for those who believe cinema is the seventh art not an entertainment business
lars von trier creates a noir atmosphere of postwar germany utterly captivating
you get absorbed into the dream and you 're let go only at the end credits
the plot necessarily comes second but it still is a thrilling story with tough issues being raised
just wonderful
this is the definite lars von trier movie my favorite i rank it higher than breaking the waves or the latest dancer in the dark i simply love the beauty of the picture the framing is so original acting is wonderful a must see
before dogma 95 when lars used movies as art not just a story
a beautiful painting about love and death
this is one of my favorite movies of all time
the color the music just perfect
europa is a masterpiece that gives the viewer the excitement that must have come with the birth of the narrative film nearly a century ago
this film is truly unique and a work of genius
the camerawork and the editing are brilliant and combined with the narrative tropes of alienation used in the film creates an eerie and unforgettable cinematic experiencebr br the participation of barbara suwkowa and eddie constantine in the cast are two guilty pleasures that should be seen and enjoyed
max von sydow provides his great voice as the narratorbr br a one of a kind movie
four stars
i have n't seen this movie in about 5 years but it still haunts me
br br when asked about my favorite films this is the one that i seem to always mention first
there are certain films that seem to touch a place within you a place so protected and hidden and yet so sensitive that they make a lifelong impression on the viewer not unlike a lifechanging event such as the ending of a serious relationship or the death of a friend this film shook me when i first saw it
it left me with an emotional hangover that lasted for several days
as much as the movie was good i have nothing more to say about it than what was said already
all i wanted is to point the fact that the movie isnt from sweden but from denemark
maybe i wrong and in that case i 'll be happy to know my mistakes so take the and notify me
piece of subtle art
maybe a masterpiece
doubtlessly a special story about the ambiguity of existence
tale in kafka style about impossibility of victory or surviving in a perpetual strange world
the life is in this film only exercise of adaptation
lesson about limits and original sin about the frailty of innocence and error of his waysbr br leopold kessle is another joseph k images of trial and same ambiguous woman
and europa is symbol of basic crisis who has many aspects like chimeric wars or unavailing search of truthessencegolden agebr br methaphor or parable the movie is history of disappointed 's evolution
war peace business or lie are only details of gelatintime
hypocrisy is a mask
love a convention
the sacrifice only method to hope understanding a painful reality
man oh man i 've been foolishly procrastinating to watch this film and finally had the chance to do so
and news are marvellous labyrinthine spectaclebr br for any von trier 's follower both rigets element of crime dogville dancer in the dark the five obstructions etc europa is probably the differential for its greatness in visual terms
everything is beautifully somber and claustrophobic
you really get the feeling of being inside this imaginary nightmarish time warp
taking from the masters of surreal cinema like bunuel bergman till noir films of the 40 's with acidic drops of avantguard von trier leads the artfilm scene as the well intended totalitarian movie maker of nowadays
his authoritarian way of dealing with very intricate issues without being irrational hits the nerve of the viewer with the intent to cure some of the deepest wounds we feed in our hypocritical worldbr br as utopian as it seems i do believe people like von trier could help society in many ways in a broader aspect
the day films and filmmakers that carry this sort of power are no longer necessary as a tool for reflection perhaps it could be the start of a new era the age of emotional control over our fears
this is what he offers to us constantly through his work over and overbr br bravo
lars von trier 's europa is a worthy echo of the third man about an american coming to postworld war ii europe and finds himself entangled in a dangerous mysterybr br jeanmarc barr plays leopold kessler a germanamerican who refused to join the us army during the war arrives in frankfurt as soon as the war is over to work with his uncle as a sleeping car conductor on the zentropa railway
what he does n't know is the war is still secretly going on with an underground terrorist group called the werewolves who target american allies
leopold is strongly against taking any sides but is drawn in and seduced by katharina hartmann the femme fatale daughter of the owner of the railway company
her father was a nazi sympathizer but is pardoned by the american colonel harris because he can help get the german transportation system up and running again
the colonel soon enlists or forces leopold to be a spy to see if the werewolves might carry out attacks on the trainsbr br soon leopold is stuck in an adventure by being involved with both sides of the conflict in a mysterious and film noirish way where everyone and everything is not what it seems
its amazing to watch the naive leopold deal with everything before he finally boils over and humorously and violently takes control
the film is endlessly unpredictablebr br the film stylishly shot it always takes place at night during the winter with lots of falling snow
its shot in black and white with shots of color randomly appearing throughout
also background screens displaying images that counter act with the images up front
add max von sydow 's hypnotic narration and europa becomes a dreamlike place that 's out of this worldbr br this is now a personal favorite film of mine
released as zentropa in north america to avoid confusion with agniezska holland 's own holocaust film europa europa this third theatrical feature by a filmmaker who never ceases to surprise inspire or downright shock is a bizarre nostalgic elaborate film about a naive american in germany shortly following the end of wwii
the american named leo does n't fully get what he 's doing there
he has come to take part in fixing up the country since in his mind it 's about time germany was shown some charity
no matter how that sounds he is not a nazi sympathizer or so much as especially progerman merely mixed up
his uncle who works on the railroad gets leo a job as a helmsman on a sleeping car and he is increasingly enmeshed in a vortex of 1945 germany 's horrors and enigmasbr br this progression starts when leo played rather memorably by the calm yet restless actor jeanmarc barr meets a sultry heiress on the train played by barbara sukowa an actress with gentility on the surface but internal vigor
she seduces him and then takes him home to meet her family which owns the company which manufactures the trains
these were the precise trains that took jews to their deaths during the war but now they run a drab daytoday timetable and the woman 's uncle kessler postures as another one of those good germans who were just doing their jobs
there is also udo kier the tremendous actor who blew me away in von trier 's shocking second film epidemic though here he is mere scenerybr br another guest at the house is eddie constantine an actor with a quiet strength playing a somber american intelligence man
he can confirm that uncle kessler was a war criminal though it is all completely baffling to leo
americans have been characterized as gullible rubes out of their element for decades but little have they been more blithely unconcerned than leo who goes back to his job on what gradually looks like his own customized death trainbr br the story is told in a purposely uncoordinated manner by the film 's danish director lars von trier whose anchor is in the film 's breathtaking editing and cinematography
he shoots in black and white and color he uses doubleexposures optical effects and trick photography having actors interact with rearprojected footage he places his characters inside a richly shaded visceral world so that they sometimes feel like insects caught between glass for our more precise surveybr br this grand jury prizewinning surrealist work is allegorical but maybe in a distinct tone for every viewer
i interpret it as a film about the last legs of nazism symbolized by the train and the ethical accountability of americans and others who appeared too late to salvage the martyrs of these trains and the camps where they distributed their condemned shiploads
during the time frame of the movie and the nazi state and such significance to the train are dead but like decapitated chickens they persist in jolting through their reflexesbr br the characters music dialogue and plot are deliberately hammy and almost satirically procured from film noir conventions
the most entrancing points in the movie are the entirely cinematographic ones
two trains halting back and forth barr on one and sukowa on another
an underwater shot of proliferating blood
an uncommonly expressive sequence on what it must be like to drown
and most metaphysically affecting of all an anesthetic shot of train tracks as max von sydow 's voice allures us to hark back to europe with him and abandon our personal restraint
the best way for me to describe europa which is high on the list of my favourite films is the exclamation that came from a companion after the film ended i did n't know films could be made like that
entirely original in it 's visual style it is one of the best examples of what cinema can be
it 's as far away from the master and coverage style of shooting as one can get perfectly integrating many layers of image sound effects props dialogue voice over performance editing lighting etc all equal none predominant
despite hollywood 's dialogue myopia cinema is not about dialogue nor is it about beautiful lighting action or music
it works best when all the elements are on an equal footing where only the blending of those elements in the order or combination in which they are presented will communicate the idea
reduce or eliminate the contribution of one element and the film has no meaning
europa is what cinema should strive to be
it is not every film 's job to stimulate you superficially
i will take an ambitious failure over a massmarket hit any day
while this really ca n't be described as a failure the sum of its parts remains ambiguous
that indecipherable quality tantalizes me into watching it again and again
this is a challenging provocative movie that does not wrap things up neatly
the problem with the movie is in its structure
its inpenetrable plot seems to be winding up just as a second ending is tacked on
though everything is technically dazzling the movie is exactly too long by that unit
the longdelayed climax of leo 's awakening comes about 20 minutes latebr br great cinematography often comes at the expense of a decent script but here the innovative camera technique offers a wealth of visual ideas
the compositing artifice is provocative and engaging a character is rearprojected but his own hand in the foreground is n't
the world depicted is deliberate treacherous and absurd
keep your eyes peeled for a memorable technically astonishing assassination that will make your jaw dropbr br the compositions are stunning
whomever chose to release the videotape in the pan scan format must have never seen it
where is the dvdbr br it is unfathomable how anyone could give this much originality a bad review
you should see it at least once
you get the sense that von trier bit off more than he could chew but this movie ends up being richer for it
i suspect he is familiar with hitchcock 's foreign correspondent in which devious europeans also manipulate an american dupe and several welles movies that take delirious joy in technique as much as he does
all von trier movies explore the plight of the naif amidst unforgiving societies
after zentropa von trier moved away from this type of audacious technical experiment towards dreary overrated unnuanced sap like breaking the waves and dancer in the dark
critics need to review what they class as a quality movie
i think the critics have seen too many actions films and have succumbed to the matrix style of films
europa is a breath of fresh air a film with so many layers that one viewing is not enough to understand or appreciate this outstanding film
lars von trier shows that old styles of filming can produce marvellous cinema and build drama and tension
the back projection effect he uses during the film arouses and enhances the characters and the focus of the conversation they are having
other effects he uses such as the colour and black and white in one scene much like hitchcock and the girl with the red coat grabs attention and enhances the drama and meaning of the scene
the commentary is superb and has a hypnotic effect again maintaining the focus on the central characters in the scene and there actionsbr br i could talk about the effects more but i think you all would agree they push this film into a category of its own and really heighten the drama of the film
a film to buy if you do n't own already and one to see if you have notbr br 1010 do n't miss this artistic noir film from one of the great film directors
i had started to lose my faith in films of recent being inundated with the typical genre hollywood film
story lines fail and camera work is merely copied from the last film of similiar taste
but then i saw zentropa and my faith was renewed
not only is the metaphorical storyline enthralling but the use of color and black and white is visually stimulating
the narrator takes you through a spellbounding journey every step of the way and engrosses you into europa 1945 we have all seen death put on screen in a hundred thousand ways but the beauty of this film is how it takes you through every slowmoving moment that leads you to death
unlike many films it does n't cut after one second of showing a knife but forces you to watch the devastating yet sensuous beauty of a man 's final moments
i think we can all take something different away from what this movie is trying to say but it is definitely worth taking the time to find out what it all really means
i would love to talk more in depth about the film for any one who wishes to send me an email
enjoy it
that was the first thing that sprang to mind as i watched the closing credits to europa make there was across the screen never in my entire life have i seen a film of such technical genius the visuals of europa are so impressive that any film i watch in it 's wake will only pale in comparison forget your michael bay ridley scott slick hollywood cinematography europa has more ethereal beauty than anything those two could conjure up in a million years
now i 'd be the first to hail lars von trier a genius just off the back of his films breaking the waves and dancer in the dark but this is stupid the fact that europa has gone unnoticed by film experts for so long is a crime against cinema whilst overrated rubbish like crouching tiger hidden dragon and life is beautiful clean up at the academy awards europa has been hidden away absent form video stores and any british tv channels
br br the visuals in europa are not mtv gloss it 's not a case of style over substance its more a case of substance dictating style
much like his first film the element of crime von trier uses the perspective of the main character to draw us into his world and much like element the film begins with the main character being hypnotized
as we move down the tracks the voice of the narrator counts us down into a deep sleep until we awake in europa
this allows von trier and his three cinematographers to pay with the conventions of time and imagery there are many scenes in europa when a character in the background who is in black and white will interact with a person in the foreground who will be colour von trier is trying to show us how much precedence the coloured item or person has over the plot for instance it 's no surprise that the first shot of leopold kessler is in colour since he is the only character who 's actions have superiority over the film
br br the performances are good they may not be on par with performances in later von trier films but that 's just because the images are sometimes so distracting that you do n't really pick up on them the first time round
but i would like to point out the fantastic performance of jeanmarc barr in the lead role whose blind idealism is slowly warn down by the two opposing sides until he erupts in the films final act
again muck like the element of crime the film ends with our hero unable to wake up from his nightmare state left in this terrible place with only the continuing narration of von sydow to seal his fate
europa is a tremendous film and i cant help thinking what a shame that von trier has abandoned this way of filming since he was clearly one of the most talented visual directors working at that time europa much like the rest of his cinematic cannon is filled with a wealth of iconic scenes
his dedication to composition and miseenscene is unrivalled not to mention his use of sound and production design
but since his nofrills melodramas turned out to be breaking the waves and dancer in the dark then who can argue but it does seems like a waste of an imaginative talent
1010
contains spoilers due to me having to describe some film techniques so read at your own risk
br br i loved this film
the use of tinting in some of the scenes makes it seem like an old photograph come to life
i also enjoyed the projection of people on a back screen
for instance in one scene leopold calls his wife and she is projected behind him rather than in a typical split screen
her face is huge in the back and leo 's is in the foregroundbr br one of the best uses of this is when the young boys kill the ravensteins on the train a scene shot in an almost political poster style with facial close ups
it reminded me of battleship potemkin that intense constant style coupled with the spray of red to convey tons of horror without much gore
same with the scene when katharina finds her father dead in the bathtub you can only see the red water on the side
it is one of the things i love about von trier his understatement of horror which ends up making it all the more creepybr br the use of text in the film was unique like when leo 's character is pushed by the word werewolf
i have never seen anything like that in a filmbr br the use of black comedy in this film was well done
ernsthugo jregrd is great as leo 's uncle
it brings up the snickers i got from his role in the kingdom this humor makes the plotline of absurd anal retentiveness of train conductors against the terrible backdrop of ww2 and all the chaos easier to take
it reminds me of riget in the way the hospital administrator is trying to maintain a normalcy at the end of part one when everything is going crazy
it shows that some people are truly oblivious to the awful things happening around them
yet some people like leo are tuned in but do nothing positive about itbr br the voice over done expertly well by max von sydow is amusing too
it draws you into the story and makes you jump into leo 's head which at times is a scary place to bebr br the movie brings up the point that one is a coward if they do n't choose a side
i see the same idea used in dancer in the dark where bjork 's character does n't speak up for herself and ends up being her own destruction
actually at one time von trier seemed antiwoman to me by making breaking the waves and dancer but now i know his male characters do n't fare well either
i found myself at the same place during the end of dancer when you seriously want the main character to rethink their actions but of course they never do
lars von trier is never backward in trying out new techniques
some of them are very original while others are best forgottenbr br he depicts postwar germany as a nightmarish train journey
with so many cities lying in ruins leo kessler a young american of german descent feels obliged to help in their restoration
it is not a simple task as he quickly finds outbr br his uncle finds him a job as a night conductor on the zentropa railway line
his job is to attend to the needs of the passengers
when the shoes are polished a chalk mark is made on the soles
a terrible argument ensues when a passenger 's shoes are not chalked despite the fact they have been polished
there are many allusions to the german fanaticism of adherence to such stupid detailsbr br the railway journey is like an allegory representing man 's procession through life with all its trials and tribulations
in one sequence leo dashes through the back carriages to discover them filled with halfstarved bodies appearing to have just escaped from auschwitz
these images horrible as they are are fleeting as in a dream each with its own terrible impact yet unconnectedbr br at a station called urmitz leo jumps from the train with a parceled bomb
in view of many bystanders he connects the bomb to the underside of a carriage
he returns to his cabin and makes a connection to a time clock
later he jumps from the train and lies in the cool grass on a river bank
looking at the stars above he decides that his job is to build and not destroy
subsequently as he sees the train approaching a giant bridge he runs at breakneck speed to board the train and stop the clock
if you care to analyse the situation it is a completely impossible task
quite ridiculous in fact
it could only happen in a dreambr br it 's strange how one remembers little details such as a row of cups hanging on hooks and rattling away with the swaying of the trainbr br despite the fact that this film is widely acclaimed i prefer lars von trier 's later films
the bomb scene described above really put me off
perhaps i'm a realist
zentropa is the most original movie i 've seen in years
if you like unique thrillers that are influenced by film noir then this is just the right cure for all of those hollywood summer blockbusters clogging the theaters these days
von trier 's followups like breaking the waves have gotten more acclaim but this is really his best work
it is flashy without being distracting and offers the perfect combination of suspense and dark humor
it 's too bad he decided handheld cameras were the wave of the future
it 's hard to say who talked him away from the style he exhibits here but it 's everyone 's loss that he went into his heavily theoretical dogma direction instead
zentropa has much in common with the third man another noirlike film set among the rubble of postwar europe
like ttm there is much inventive camera work
there is an innocent american who gets emotionally involved with a woman he does n't really understand and whose naivety is all the more striking in contrast with the nativesbr br but i 'd have to say that the third man has a more wellcrafted storyline
zentropa is a bit disjointed in this respect
perhaps this is intentional it is presented as a dreamnightmare and making it too coherent would spoil the effect
br br this movie is unrelentingly grimnoir in more than one sense one never sees the sun shine
grim but intriguing and frightening
von trier once explained how he created such strong involvement from the viewer with his movies by placing his movie world in about the middle of the real world and the imagined world
so as viewers we think we watch a true story while in fact we are thoroughly manipulated often to the point that the movie works disturbing or painful
of course the dogmefilms acted only as a vehicle for this theory br br the story is typical for von trier our hero is idealistic seems to balance his relations with everybody else but soon becomes the victim of the problems others have created in the past for themselves
the idealist inevitably has to reject society in order to stay idealistic and becomes the terrorist
mankind is spoiled and purity only leads to destruction
the movie is also full of cynical undertones about the role of the germans and americans in postwar germanybr br as a technical achievement the movie is wonderfully designed shifting and fading washedout colors screen overlays action on different overlays
in this movie we can see how good von trier 's handles film as a technical medium
in his later works he seems to step down from this
with stunning cinematography and a thread of kafkaesque absurdity this movie had me from the simple yet fascinating opening scene
the movie plays much like a dream and i think that may be why people either hate it or love it
characters are drawn superficially and the story itself is slight and perhaps a little pointless
but these are failings of the movie but conscious choices
the film works is n't trying to work as history but rather is a deconstruction of 1940s war movies
br br i would have trouble arguing that there was much real substance to the movie but the movie is such a cinematic wonder that i was completely swept away
this is one of the most beautifully filmed movies ever and there is a wild imagination in its style
i can completely understand why people would hate it but i give it 910
on october of 1945 the american german descendant leopold kessler arrives in a postwar frankfurt and his bitter uncle kessler gets a job for him in the zentropa train line as a sleeping car conductor
while traveling in the train learning his profession he sees the destructed occupied germany and meets katharina hartmann the daughter of the former powerful entrepreneur of transport business and owner of zentropa max hartmann
leopold stays neutral between the allied forces and the germans and becomes aware that there is a terrorist group called werewolves killing the sympathizers of the allied and conducting subversive actions against the allied forces
he falls in love for katharina and sooner she discloses that she was a werewolf
when max commits suicide leopold is also pressed by the werewolves and need to take a position and a decisionbr br europa is an impressive and anguishing kafkanian story of the great danish director lars von trier
using an expressionist style that recalls fritz lang and alternating a magnificent black white cinematography with some colored details this movie discloses a difficult period of germany and some of the problems this great nation had to face after being defeated in the war
very impressive the action of the occupation forces destroying resources that could permit a faster reconstruction of a destroyed country and the corruption with the jew that should identify max
jeanmarc barr has an stunning performance in the role of man that wants to stay neutral but is manipulated everywhere by everybody
the hypnotic narration of max von sydow is another touch of class in this awarded film
my vote is ninebr br title europa
this is the fifth von trier film i have seen
i believe that he is the only director to whom i have given such a high score on all his movies
four of them the element of crime europa breaking the waves and dancer in the dark i have given a 10 and one the idiots i have given a 9
he has been chided for calling himself one of the best working directors
i tend to agree with him
i cannot blame him for being arrogant when he has made such great films
in 50 years when von trier retires he will be looked upon as the preeminent film artist from europe and there will be classes taught in his name
he simply is the bergman or fellini of our time
it is too bad the critics are too intrigued with themselves to notice thisbr br about europa itself i 'll admit that it was confusing and that its narrative did not seem strong
i think that 's the point
this film was obviously meant to represent a nightmare or the subconscious at some level
this is absolutely clear from the framing of the film max von sydow 's narration
we are hypnotized or von trier is hypnotized and this is ourhis subconscious mind
i'm inclined to lean more towards his mind since the degradation of europe concerns me an american very little
this framing is also clear if you have seen the element of crime an even more brilliant film than this
in the element of crime the film begins with a hypnotist whom we actually see on screen this time is hypnotizing fisher a european detective who wants to get to the root of his mental anguish
the first words of that film are fantasy is okay but my job is to keep you on track
and whenever fisher the narrator gets off track the hypnotist does chastize him and tells him to get back on with the story
he even laughs when a character is given a really silly and trite line
something along the lines of do you understand the difference between good and evil
the hypnotist laughs and says now fisher she did n't really say that did she
br br so the key to interpreting europa almost a sequel of sorts to the element of crime is that we are deep in ourvon trier 's subconscious and the symbols there are to be interpreted within ourselves and will likely be different for everyone
what does the train itself symbolize
consider it internally and only then discuss it externally
europa is a great film a masterpiece
i was never bored by it even though i watched it at 3 am
the perfect time to watch actually since it works in dream logic
storyline max von sydow 's voiceover narration hypnotizes the protagonist back to 1945 where our protagonist the young american ideologist leopold kessler has just arrived in postwwii 1945 germany to help rebuilding the damaged country
uncle kessler supplies leopold with a job in the big zentropa train corporation but soon leopold falls in love with katharina hartmann daughter of zentropa owner max hartmann
leopold soon finds himself caught in a web of corruption being taken advantage of losing his ideology and is forced to chose between pest or colerabr br mysterious mesmerizing manipulative noirish haunting beautiful and ugly
these are some immediate grandiose descriptions that come to mind when thinking of lars von trier 's 1991 masterpiece europa the final chapter of the europa trilogy
in usa it was retitled zentropa so audiences would n't confuse it with agnieszka holland 's europa europa from 1990
the europa trilogy also consists of forbrydelsens element from 1984 and epidemic from 1987
the trilogy thematically deals with hypnotism and loss of idealism although the themes of this trilogy are not as essential as the visuals
in the openingshot of europa we see a locomotive moving towards us while our unidentified narrator literally hypnotizes us on the mental count of ten you will be in europa
be there at ten
i say ten
a metaphor for movies' ability to transport us into a subconscious dreamrealitybr br europa utilizes a strange but extremely effective visual style that famous russian director andrei tarkovsky is trier 's maininfluence says it all
it 's a blackandwhite movie occasionally intertwined with red in form of blood a red dress etc
according to rumors this inspired steven spielberg to use the similar effect in shindler 's list from 1993
furthermore trier uses socalled dutch angels and reinvents backgroundprojection by adding separately shot cooperating layers upon layers but unlike old hollywood movies that incorporated it for economical reasons trier uses it for artistic reasons
these carefully executed strangelooking visual techniques underline that we are in a dreamreality we are hypnotized the universe of europa is not real
europa is often criticized for weighing advanced technique above plot and characters but hey that 's what reviewers criticized stanley kubrick 's 1968 visual masterpiece 2001 a space odyssey for nowadays it holds an obligatory place in all cinemahistory booksbr br europa also gets accused of historical incorrectness
apparently trier assigns the nazis' werewolf terroristgroup too much historical significance
according to various onlinesources that 's correct yet trier 's purposes are neither educational nor portraying history accurately
europa is a neverending nightmare
leopold kessler is hypnotized therefore the universe that the audience encounters is a distorted reality
equally it shows how our memory deceives us a 100 accurate reconstruction is a lie
although young audiences who experience europa are too young to have memories from wwii we have a collective memory of it from various bbc documentaries so these small inaccuracies actually serve a purpose they inform us us that we are not in postwwii germany 1945 but in leopolds memory of itbr br all three europa trilogy chapters portray young ideologists with noble intentions forced into corruption and losing their ideological innocence
the ambiguous endings of forbrydelsens element and europa show the ideologists getting forever caught in their hypnotized realities
before during and after shooting europa in 1990 in poland lars von trier and cowriter niels vrsel were extremely interested in wwii
it shows
it 's packed with extremely beautiful shots catching the atmosphere of the timeperiod spoton
a great example is the old polish church in the last act of europa
as with 2001 space odyssey i think europa will receive it 's rightfully deserved place in cinemahistory
its method of twisting old filmnoir loveaffair clichs and visual techniques is so unique strange and completely different from anything you will see from hollywood nowadays or any other dreamfactory for that matterbr br europa is an essential movie in the lars von trier catalog
some write it off as pure commercial speculation but that would be catastrophic
it 's right up there with other trier classics and semiclassics such as forbrydelsens element from 1984 the tvseries riget from 1993 and dogville from 2003 it 's a unique experience from before trier cared for his actors and before the dogme95 manifesto
watch it
on the count of ten 910
a few years ago a friend got from one of his other friends a video with the michael mann film 'heat' on it
after we finished that movie and were about to stand up we saw that there is another film just after tough on the cassette 's envelope the owner did n't write it up
yet we were all glued back to our seats by its distinct opening which lacked creditsbr br some two hours later i just sat there wondering how could i not have heard of this masterpiece before
br br this film was europa
lars von trier woke film noir from the dead deconstructed reality with intentionally obvious sets yet often there was haunting similarity with postwar german photographs i saw
and then the tricky cutsbr br the story itself is a hardtotake moral odyssey that has no happy end
a young american pacifist of german descent comes to postwar germany intent on doing some good to pay for the bombs his countrymen dropped
but he mostly meets distrust and selfdestructive defiance
he hires with zentropa a diningandsleepingcar company whose owner is one of the nazi collaborators the occupiers whitewash
our hero falls in love with his daughter who later turns out to be a member of the werewolf nazi postwar terrorists
when he does n't understand the world anymore in his rage he blows up a railroad bridge under a train which he just savedbr br as a final note for historical correctness in the real world the werewolf were nowhere as important as the film implies they were mostly a final nazi propaganda coup
after an ss unit assassinated the major of alliedoccupied aachen two months before the capitulation the nazis announced the creation of whole legions of saboteurs and terrorists who will be ready to fight behind the lines the werewolf
but only a few hundred of mostly hitler youth received some training and while two or three times some were deployed to murder suspected communists or forcedlabourer foreigners in bavarian villages to imprint lasting fear on inhabitants with hitler 's death and the war 's end it all fell apartbr br however the werewolf propaganda had a profound effect on the occupiers
they feared the werewolf everywhere suspected it behind any serious accident but without exception another cause was found later
for example when a gas main exploded in the police hq of bombedout bremen or when the soviet military commander died in a motorbike accident in berlin
the effect was strongest on the soviets who arrested tens of thousands 'preemptively' on suspicion of being werewolf and closed them off in prison camps where a lot of them died
someone release this movie on dvd so it can take its hallowed place as on of the greatest films of all time in ten to twenty years when critics and film historians look back on the socalled films of the 1990 's and see how vapid they were for the most part and how lars von trier tried to revolutionize and revitalize the international film world with this masterpiece
as it stands zentropa is one of the most fascinating and artistic views of the bleakness and almost psychotic uncertainty that oozed out of post wwii europe namely the decimated german landscape whose physical horrors were matched only by the damage to the psyche of its people
von trier brilliantly paints his vision on screen
you will feel like you are watching some lost espionage noir classic from the late 1940 's with the perfectly lighted black and white scenes while at the same time feel you are on the brink of something beyond the cutting edge especially in scenes like the assassination aboard the train
literally when you see this movie you are witnessing the evolution of an art form
br br for some reason von trier got caught up in his own dogma movement shortly after this
and while his breaking the waves and dancer in the dark are classics in their own right it is with zentropa that he truly lifted the art of film making to new and exciting heights
1010 ages like a fine wine and begs for a dvd release
it was an excellent piece to the puppet series because this film showed all of the series from one to seven
and this was about one woman trying to stop the new puppet master because i would have never guessed that the puppets would be in pain
plus it showed some of the puppet master series that i did n't see and i what to see it so badly like part two
it showed an appearance of torch which can turn things and humans which is cool and showed the return of the puppet master from part one
it also showed little aliens from part 4 that was also cool it showed other people episodes that might be good to them and it didso thanks to this puppet master is going to be a big hit
this movie is a great way for the series to finally end
peter is all grown up and is now the puppet master
well this girl comes to destroy the puppets and learn toulon 's secrets but instead she listens to the story about the puppets
most of this movie is footage from puppet master ii puppet master iii puppet master 4 puppet master 5 curse of the puppet master and retro puppet master
personally i wish puppet master vs demonic toys would finally be made but the way this movie ends they basically say this is the final movie in the series
after some of the negative reviews i heard on this movie i was doubtful of giving it a go but i had 399 in my wallet thought id gamble on buying a budget like movie saw this and gave it ago i'm glad i did i enjoyed it
directed by the star of films such as chain reaction the ring bourne identity i had to gamble with this even if it was rubbish but it were n't at all i found some of the humour quite funny especially alfred molina the star of spiderman 2 the character doc ock
he was excellent the most enjoyable part of the film
of course like many other people which bought this movie i saw matthew 's name and that made me get it
and no his part is n't big at all it 's very short at the very end of the film it 's not a big part which makes me believe thats why people hate the film
i suggest you give it a go
some parts are a pit poor that needed polishing the acting and a bit more action
but it 's watchable
i do n't understand why the other comments focus on mcconaughey
he has never been a very interesting film actor
br br the best part of this movie is the writing and the wit
alfred molina and patrick mcgaw make an unusual comic duo definitely not stock types
although one ca n't say their characters are well developed that does n't make them any less funnybr br the version i saw was on hdnet and had subtitles for the spanish dialog so that was certainly not a problem
the use of spanish gives it more authenticity
br br a very underrated movie judging by the unusually low score imdb members have given it
i thought it was fun and interesting and worth a 7 at least
a lot of slick movies with higher scores and making big money at the box office are much less interesting
first of all riget is wonderful
good comedy and mystery thriller at the same time
nice combination of strange 'dogma' style of telling the story together with good music and great actors
but unfortunately there 's no 'the end'
as for me it 's unacceptable
i was thinking how it will be possible to continue the story without helmer and drusse
and i have some idea
i think lars should make riget iii a little bit different
i'm sure that 3rd part without helmer would n't be the same
so here 's my suggestion
mayble little bit stupid maybe not
i know that lars likes to experiment
so why not to make small experiment with riget3
i think the only solution here is to create puppetdriven animation or even computer 3d animation
i know it 's not the same as real actors but in principle i believe it could work only this way it 's possible to make actors alive again
for riget fans this should n't be so big difference if the animation will be done in good way average 'watcher' will consider it normal just after first few shots of the movie
the most important thing now is the story
it 's completely understandable that it 's not possible to create riget 3 with the actors nowadays
so why not to play with animation
and look for the possibilities that it gives to you
even marketing one
great director finishes his trilogy after 10 years using puppet animation
just dreamsbr br i hope to see riget 3 someday or even to see just the script
i'm curious how the story ends and as i expect everybody here dobr br greets slajbr br ps i'm not talking about the kingdom hospital by stephen king
normally i do n't like series at all
they 're all to predictable and they tend to become boring and dull very fastbr br these series however are well played the story follows through all episodes and even if you miss one the story will still be catching your mindbr br the episodes are all filmed on a hospital and takes you further and further in to the mysteries of dark and old secrets that lies just beneath the surface of the mighty hospital
more eeriness and dark secrets released in the final parts of lars von trier 's fantastic horror satire the kingdom much more is revealed and the ending just leaves you begging for more
plus a great performance from udo kier in a more substantial role
second part of the hit danish tvseries is slightly inferior to the first one but has plenty of laughs and scares as well
this time udo kier plays two parts as the monster baby and his demonlike father
other standout parts this time are sren pilmarks doctor krogshoj who must face the horrible revenge of dr helmer and once again patient mrs drusse tries to solve the mysteries miss marplestyle
ends on a cliffhanger and following the deaths of lead actors ernst hugo jregrd and kirsten rolffes you wonder how theyre ever going to be able making part iii but i hope von trier will give it a shot
sadly morten rotne leffers the downs syndrome dishwasher died shortly after as well
look for stellan skarsgrd in a cameo
riget ii is a good sequel but not quite as good as the first one
this series do n't seem to be quite as serious as the first one
there are much more comedy in this good one thoughbr br we 're back at the danish rigshospitalet the danish national hospital
mrs drusse is just about to leave the hospital as her work is done but fate want 's it otherwise
she is soon chasing ghosts and helmer is doing everyone mad and it 's soon to get much worse as black powers are unleashed in the kingdombr br this story involves a lot more comedy that the previous
by all means lot of fun but it makes you take the series a little less serious
the story has kept a lot of elements from the last series and added some new ones
it 's well written but some of the new elements are just kind of silly but they save it by making it more like a comedy
good story but not as good original and thrilling as the first seriesbr br the actors are the same with some addition to the regular cast
they are all very good
it 's an odd story and setting
some parts are a total freak show and the characters change during the show so to keep it serious and keep it real is not an easy job
yet these actors handle this whole situation perfectlybr br much of the good qualities from the first series are kept intact
the cinematography is one of those qualities
the handheld camera that made trier world famous gives suspense and reality to the series
it gives the camera a unique ability to move and follow the characters and trier makes use of these abilities
good movement great lightning and good composition and editing makes this enjoyable to watchbr br be prepare to see better effect in this sequel that in the first
also be prepared to see some more
i did n't think that green thing looked all too good
thought it was unoriginal and did n't fit
never the less the effects like the ghosts are really good
the nondigital effects looks good too
little brother looks just really odd but you accept it
all over i 'd say effects are from ok to goodbr br the music is also quite good
moody and nice
some of it are really touching
it fits really nice
as the first one there are rather little music in the action scenes and it works very wellbr br all together this makes a good sequel
if you 'd seen riget you can see this one without being disappointed
it has many of the same qualities as the first series
however i would recommend seeing the first series before seeing this
these two makes up a series you do n't wanna miss
wow 5 more hours of riget
lars continues the great combination of occult dark horror and soapopera drama
picking up exactly where the last episode of the previous series left off this installation in the franchise seems somewhat more bent on haste in the last series there seemed to pass a day or a week between each episode whereas in this it clearly is one long stretch where one episode ends the next begins
a lot can be said about lars von trier but he is very diverse and pretty eccentric
both qualities show in this
the plot continues its excellence now giving a few regular characters that were minor players in the previous four episodes more attention
basically every character from the first returns at least as far as the main roles go
the pacing is n't as sharp as in the first part and i found myself less gripped by this one
that is not in any kind of way to say that this did n't involve me though i still found myself constantly watching and at several points reacting strongly often out loud to what was going on as i also was during the first
like the first this also brings up some loaded ethical questions
building on the foundation from the first this brings the story further and being a sequel the scope is also bigger
grander
more spirits more bizarre occurrences more subplots
the strong graphic material of the first also returns and it 's been kicked up a notch
the characters are developed further
the acting is amazing as that of the first
udo kier solidifies his immense talent to anyone who doubted it
playing a very difficult character and acting in a language he did n't speak and still handing in such a strong performance
the cinematography remains great and is still very handheld with rapid zooms and the occasional long take
the editing is sharp with a few direct cuts in sound
now with all that said i would really like to be able to rate this a perfect 10 or at least just under like the first four episodes
i truly enjoyed watching and i do n't regret it in the least
but this does have shortcomings the ones the first part had and more
as the first the humor just takes up too much space and this time around it 's even worse
there are several new regular characters that are there for no other reason than to provide comic relief three of them no less
scenes are set up and executed for no other reason than to make the audience laugh
fine for a comedy but what is it doing in such a dark and unpleasant yes nothing short of sadistic at times horror piece
helmer 's solitary secret hiding place of solitude is changed from the hospital roof from which he could see his beloved sweden to a bathroom
with an angle from inside the bowl
no you read that right
in general the humor seems more lowbrow more sex and bodily function jokes which again begs the question why
whilst most of the writing is excellent some of it is downright dire
several scenes are basically copied from the first miniseries
at times the drama seems a bit more bombastic than that of the first and it jumps too much at times
fortunately seldom but still noticeably plot points and items are explained away too easily
the two dishwashers while still mysterious and insightful become too much of a gimmick too overexposed in the end i guess
most of the scenes with them are still enjoyable though
in addition to that i want to reassure any reader of this that in spite of all the negative things i have just written that this is still mostly good definitely enjoyable compelling powerful and in my humble opinion it should definitely be seen by anyone who liked the first
i recommend this to any fan of lars von trier and anyone who enjoyed the first riget and wants more where that came from
i urge anyone who 's even considering watching this to make sure you 've seen all of the first before you do i bought this before i bought the first but i held out on watching until i had bought the first and watched that and i ca n't tell you how glad i am that i did
though this features a brief summary of the events in the first there are an immense amount of details and aspects that you would miss out on if you did n't see it before watching this
slightly lesser sequel but definitely still one to watch if you liked the first
810
sequel to the kingdom is bloodier and even more twisted
i only saw half but i loved what i saw
ghosts blood murder poisoning mutated babies voodoo this has it all
if you have a strong stomach and like weird movies this is for youbr br also you do n't have to see part 1 to understand this you 'll figure it outbr br does anyone know if kingdom 1 and 2 are available on dvd
sitting through these marathon movies in a theatre is tiring
br br sadly there probably wo n't be a kingdom 3ernsthugo jaregard died a year after this was filmed
but you never know
i reached the end of this and i was almost shouting no no no no
it cannot end here
there are too many unanswered questions
the engagement of the dishwashers
mona 's disappearance
helmer 's comeuppance
the zombie
was little brother saved by his father
and what about the head
argh
then i read that at least two of the cast members had passed on and i have to say i know it probably would n't be true to lars von trier 's vision but i would gladly look past replacement actors just to see the ending he had planned
granted it would be hard to find someone to play helmer as the character deserves
helmer the doctor you love to hate
i think i have yet to see a more selfabsorbed oblivious selfrighteous character on screen
but i could overlook a change in actors i just have to know how it ends
the stories in this video are very entertaining and it definately is worth a look
the first one concerns a young couple harrassed in the woods by two rednecks with a great but unexplained twist at the endbr br the seond is the best of the lot and it alone makes this worth watching a man is attacked by a dog which he fears to be rabid he finds shelter in what appears to be a hospital but he finds out the employees there are not exactly what they appear to be great twist at the end and this episode alone scores 1010
if the others were up to par with this one this would get 1010br br the third is the weakest of the bunch a girl meets with some guys and has wild sex
there appears to be no point to the story until the end with a good little twist but it is spoiled by the awful first partbr br never the less this is a great movie that will not do you wrong at all
well worth a rental
like his earlier film in a glass cage agust villaronga achieves an intense and highly poetic canvas that is even more refined visually than its predecessor
this is one of the most visually accomplished and haunting pictures one could ever see
the heightened drama intensity and undertone of violence threatens on the the melodramatic or farcical yet never steps into it
in that way it pulls off an almost impossible feat to be so overthetop and yet so painfully restrained to be so charged and yet so understated and even the explosives finales are virtuosic feasts of the eye
unabashed gorgeous and highly tense this film is simply superb
if you want to learn something about the spanish civil war and about all the political details and intrigues let me tell you you 've chosen the wrong filmbr br this is a vision of the war as it happened in majorca a small island off the coast of spain
when a war like this happens in a small island that takes position for the traitor almost at once there is no war in the open
the soldiers are sent to the front to fight in the mainland while another kind of war happens at home on the small island
there neighbours tell on other neighbours sometimes because their political views are contrary to the new regime but many people are told on because of old family fights or maybe the silent introvert who has no friends is told on by someone who wants to earn some points
and these things do n't happen in the open
there were some trials true but many other times people would just be woken up in the middle of the night taken out of their homes to the closest cemetery where they would be killed
and the next morning the bodies would be found and people would have an idea of what had happened but nobody would dare to speak or to do anything
we 're not talking about soldiers killing someone they had never seen in their life
we 're talking about people killing their neighbours and probably saying hello to their widow the next day and even attending the funeral for the guy they had killed
we 're talking about villages with one or two thousand inhabitants where everybody knew everybodybr br i am from that small island and i 've heard the stories my grandparents told me and i must say that this film upset me oh yes it did but i also found it remarkably beautiful and moving
the initial violence is not something the director or the writer made up that 's how things happened during that war
a kid knowing that his mate 's dad is in the fascist squad that killed his dad
completely possible
all that happened later on
possible too
tb was real too
at that time my island was not the holiday resort it has become
people were poor illiterate and worked in small farms
after the war there were times of hardshipbr br so you wo n't find a war story in this film or at least not the kind of war story you expect
there are no battlefields no soldiers no political intrigues
this is the meanest kind of war which happens when the space is limited when neighbours fight with their neighbours when members of the same family fight each other and they live in a place where everybody knows everybody
you 'll find a story about the damage that this particular kind of war can cause to people and the story of how they survive that damage or maybe they do n'tbr br i must mention the excellent work done by the writers who adapted the novel and by all the actors who managed to sound really majorcan
that was remarkable
the latest film by the spanish director agusti villaronga is a study on how children that experience violence and isolation within their remote community develop into troubled young adults that need certain psychic tools to deal with their hidden mental frailty
whether these tools are religion followed to a fanatical level caring for others or simply putting on a macho image whilst engaging as a maleprostitute villaronga creates a successful examination of how these vices affect three teenagers living in spain under franco
the three witness the disturbing double death or their friends before they are teenagers and subsequently bury the emotions they feel with their peers frail corpses until they meet again once more at a hospital for those suffering form tuberculosisbr br the cinematic style of the text is typically visually opulent as you would expect from the spanish auteur and is extremely reminiscent of fellow spaniard pedro almodovar 's work with themes dealing with sexual desire both heterosexual and homosexual
an element that is different between the two directors is that villaronga favours a supernatural undertone spliced with claustrophobic gritty realism opposed to almodovar 's use of surrealism although both styles are similarbr br the piece gives an insight into troubled young psyche and contains disturbing violence and scenes of a sexual nature
i highly recommend watching this film as it contains elements that will remain with the audience for a considerable period after viewing
film is designed to affect the audience and this film left me speechless
gorgeously photographed and well acted with dialog that approaches poetry the film involves lust hate murder rape theft and deception
it weaves an intense web that left me unable to take my eyes off the screen until the closing credits
the story is sweeping
it takes the audience from the atrocities of the spanish civil war to the human wreckage left behind
roger casamajor and bruno bertanzoni are two young actors who command the screen
supporting players are excellently cast and lend a real sense of authenticity
sets lighting scenery and cinematography are wonderful
i absolutely love the photography
i saw el mar yesterday and thought it to be a great movie
it starts with a childhood episode in the life of the 3 main characters ramallo manuel tur and francisca
after that we jump about 10 years to an hospital where the 3 friends meet againbr br religion sickness love violence and sexuality rage throughout the movie creating and intense and tensionfilled moviebr br i see people complaining about the film being too gory and i think they missed the point of the story
it 's a violent intense and sad story
people are expected to suffer
to cry
to get hurt
to bleed
and i think that what the film shows is n't done for pure shockvalue or presented in a distasteful way
i know that some people like their films clean even those with violence in it
but sometimes a movie needs to make you feel unconfortable to work
this is one of those movies
and a great movie it isbr br the only fault i found was that there were 3 or 4 moments were some plot details were n't 100 clear and only after thinking about them at the end of the movie it all made sense
but it was n't anything of much importance to the overall story so i still give this movie a 9
this film is in short a cinematic masterpiece
the film is moved along brilliantly by intense images that deeply move the sensitive viewer
the film opens during the spanish civil war as a group of children seek their revenge on another child
in fact they are acting out in their world a version of what they have witnessed in the adult world around them
later we meet three of these children again as adults at a sanatorium
here we see what life has wrought on each of them
one is a reclusive sexually repressed patient
another man is a hustler who has become ill the third child a young lady has become a nun and is serving at the sanatorium
this film is an allegory about the effect of violence on the psychebr br this film has a climax that is definitely not for the squeamish members of the viewing audience but it is logical as well as profoundly moving
the acting is excellent and the script is quite well written
there is a musical score that provides an undercurrent of dread throughout this film
this is not a film for thrill seekers but a film for a thoughtful audience
el mar directed by catalonian director agusti villarona and based on the novel by blai bonet offers a glimpse of the spanish history as seen by a balearic author that takes the viewer back to the days of the civil war in that country
the movie concentrates on three friends and follows them from those early days during the onset of the war in majorca to a few years later as two of those friends meet again when they are at a sanatorium lost in the countrysidebr br we first meet three boys that are playing happily
not everything is what it seems
the tragic death of one of them points out about the cruelty of the one that commits the evil deed
the boys have excluded a young girl about their age from taking part in their gamesbr br when we meet the adult ramallo again he is on his way to a sanatorium
he seems to be suffering from tuberculosis
to his surprise manuel tur one of his boyhood friends is also being treated and the young girl that was not welcomed to participate in their games is now one of the nuns that supervise their health care
it is obvious that tur looks at ramallo in a way that only means he is in love with the tough bully
their relationship will have devastating consequencesbr br roger casamajor does a good job with portraying the older ramallo
bruno bergonzino makes an impression as tur the vulnerable youth
antonia torrens plays sor francisca with conviction
angela molina puts an appearance as carmen the wife of the caretaker of the institution
simon andreu is perfect as alcantarabr br el mar is a dark film that clearly shows agusti villarona 's talents in making the novel come alive for the viewer
el mar is a tough stark utterly brilliant brave work of cinematic art
director agust villaronga with an adaptation by antoni aloy and biel mesquida of blai bonet 's novel has created a film that traces the profound effects of war on the minds of children and how that exposure wrecks havoc on adult lives
and though the focus is on war 's heinous tattoo on children the transference to like effects on soldiers and citizens of adult age is clear
this film becomes one of the finest antiwar documents without resorting to pamphleteering the end result has far greater impact because of its inherent story following children 's march toward adulthoodbr br a small group of children are shown in the spanish civil war of spain threatened with blackouts and invasive nighttime slaughtering of citizens
ramala tur julia and francisca witness the terror of the assassination of men and the revenge that drives one of them to murder and suicide
these wideeyed children become adults carrying all of the psychic disease and trauma repressed in their mindsbr br we then encounter the three who survive into adulthood where they are all confined to a tuberculosis sanitarium
ramala has survived as a male prostitute protected by his 'john' morell and has kept his life style private
tur has become a frail sexually repressed gay male whose cover is his commitment to catholicism and the blur of delusional selfmutilationcrucifixion
francisca has become a nun and serves the patients in the sanitarium
the three are rejoined by their environment in the sanitarium and slowly each reveals the scars of their childhood experiences with war
tur longs for ramala 's love ramala longs to be free from his morell and francisca must face her own internal needs covered by her white nun 's habitbr br the setting of the sanitarium provides a graphic plane where the thin thread between life and death between lust and love and between devotion and destruction is played out
to detail more would destroy the impact of the film on the individual viewer but suffice it to say that graphic sex and full nudity are involved and the viewer should be prepared to witness every form of brutality imaginable
for this viewer these scenes are of utmost importance and director villaronga is to be applauded for his perseverance and bravery in making this story so intense
the actors both as children and as adults are splendid roger cassamoor bruno bergonzini and antnia torrens are especially fine in inordinately difficult roles
the cinematography by jaime peracaula and the haunting musical score by javier navarrete serve the director 's vision
a tough film this but one highly recommended to those who are unafraid to face the horrors of war and its aftermath
in spanish with english subtitlesbr br grady harp
gespenster question of to be cool in the german cinemabr br there are not many german films in the last ten years who have made me so interest
yes the problem of the most german films are in this film gespenster too
he is on some places to uncooked to be good to see
special the figure of toni is too cool
but thats is in german films always so
everybody must to learns this coolne is the realism in this films
thats difficult to understand
but in this case it makes some sense because she steals and she lies she is the kind of girl is better you never love it because you lose it
thats not clear for the other girl nina in this film
she love her and she would lose her
but nina lost everything
she will play with soft emotion and a sad feeling
there is no way but you must take it said herbert achterbusch for twenty years
thats so often the way it goes in german films
why
nina is not inside of the laws of society the is outside and there she have no chance
this films tries not on every place to gave her a part inside
thats one of the problems the stupid break with conventions the criminal fascination
throw it all away and go nowhere
but the actress plays this difficult part very interesting
on the other side there the parents who are the pendant to the two girls
the have a car a hotel suite the have money and live in world with music of the opera
but the film stand always in some distance to seem
there is no much explaining of thembr br in the center of this film there is one scene you will never forget
the two girls got to a casting
and there they should say how they find together
in this scene toni will lying on
she said a fantastic storyhas nothing to do with her
and then nina will say the truth
she said it in an introversion way
there is no exhibition in it
she looks to the bottom and said what will happened for here
thats a great moment
in the next scene on the party with pictures in red this feeling is going on than toni goes away br br okay the film will end in the german way of coolne rubbish here the circle of sadness is closing
but there was a moment where is happening something else and this moment was important
he is more than german coolne and this moments are rare in the german cinema in this time
gespenster forms together with yella and jerichow the gespenstertrilogy of director christian petzold doubtless one of the cremedelacreme german movie directors of our timebr br roughly gespenster tells the story of a french woman whose daughter had been kidnapped as a 3 years old child while the mother turned around her head for 1 minute in berlin and has never been seen ever
since then the mother keeps traveling to berlin whenever there is a possibility and searches by aid of timedilated photography for girls of the age of approximately the present age of her age
as we hear later in the movie the mother was already a lot of times convinced that she had found her daughter marie
however this time when she meets nina everything comes quite differentbr br the movie does not bring solutions not even partsolutions and insofar it is rather disappointing
we are not getting equipped either in order to decide if the mother is really insane or not if her actual daughter is still alive or not
most disappointing is the end
after what we have witnessed in the movie it is an imposition for the watcher that he is let alone as the auteur leaves nina alone
the simple walking away symbolizing that nothing has changed can be a strong effect of dramaturgy but in gespenster it is displacedbr br since critics have been suggesting freudian motives in this movie let me give my own attempt why is it that similar persons do not know one another especially not the persons that another similar person knows
this is quite an insane question agreed from the standpoint of aristotelian logic according to which the notion of the individual holds
the individual is such a person that does not share any of its defining characteristics with anyone else
so the aristotelian answer to my question is they do not know one another because their similarity is by pure change
everybody who is not insane believes that
however what about the case if these similar persons share other similarities which can hardly be by change eg
scarfs on their left under ankle or a heartshaped birthmark under their right shoulderblade
this is the metaphysical context out of which this movie is made although i am not sure whether even the director has realized that
despite our modern aristotelian world the superstition conserved in the mythologies of people around the globe that similar people also share parts of their individuality and that individuality therefore is not something erratic but rather diffusional so that the borders between persons are open such and similar believes build a strong backbone of irrationalism despite our otherwise strongly rational thinking a source of gespenster of the most interesting kind
i 've seen this film more than once now and there 's always someone complaining about the obvious construction of the plot afterwards
but then this is part of petzold 's game he plays along with the rules of genrebr br it 's very nice how the highly improbable story of how the two girls meet is again mirrored in another even more improbable story that the girls make up for a casting
this film is a journey between fact and fiction it 's more about potentials things that might have happened in the past or might be happening in the future than it is about actual ongoings
it 's a reverie sorts of so apt enough there are a lot of motives freud might have found interesting for his dream analysis like all the doppelgangerconstellations
br br also i think gespenster might be interesting to be watched in comparison to current asian cinema of the uncanny petzold 's everyday urban architecture also feels haunted in an unobtrusive strangely familiar way
this film is not about the obvious
to describe it as the story of two girls who meet and eventually become friends and lovers or as the story of an orphaned mother who searches europe for her lost daughter clearly does n't say much about the nature of gespenster at all
this was just another marvelous film of the berlin festival
but unlike yes by sally potter which i had seen some days before where after leaving the cinema i felt a strong desire of wishing to embrace the whole world and was just happy to be alive this time quite the opposite thing happened there was something that dragged me down and the air suddenly felt cold and hard to breathe
it was as if all of a sudden there was nothing left all hope all future had been taken away to a dead placebr br nina 's life seemed to be dismal and locked but then one lovely day there appears that kind of luminosity that opens up the horizon and makes her believe in the fulfillment of her dreams
there was nobody at her side but suddenly she finds a companion just out of nothing someone who was able to share the most hidden feelings of her life
that person was toni a vagabond girl who does not seem to have any roots just like herselfbr br but the film 's title is ghosts and ghosts appear and disappear as they wish there is no way to retain them ghosts also represent the hidden fantasies of people strange ideas that occupy your mind and are only perceived by yourself hiding away from all other people
franoise a french woman is a victim of such ghosts
she once lost her child daughter in berlin who apparently had been robbed from her in a supermarket in just one moment of inattentiveness
now time has passed and franoise is back in berlin still looking for the missing childbr br nina could be that child after all she has got that same scar at her ankle and the heartshaped birthmark between her shoulder blades which seems to prove her true identitybr br and nina adopts that idea after all she is not only in desperate need of a companion she also longs for a mother
but in the end she is emptyhanded toni has disappeared with a man and her supposed mum turns out to be a sick woman
marie is dead concludes franoise 's husband and the statement could not be more disillusioning
nina is just a nia a girl without name there is no hope for any divine fulfillment
there is no marie in this world to accompany our lonely lives
therefore in the end we see nina all alone about to walk along the road that has opened up before her into a future that seems joyless and uncertain
a funny comedy from beginning to end
there are several hilarious scenes but it 's also loaded with many subtle comedic moments which is what made the movie for me
creative story line with a very talented cast
i thoroughly enjoyed it
this silly movie is really fun for the younger audiences
its heros are a couple of dud detectives whose sophomoric attitudes lead them down some very silly roads
chasing the big murder case you will see these detectives go to every length to solve the crime
no nudity but lots of sexual implication slapstick silliness everything adolescents go for
low budget but very entertaining
definite cult classic potential
for a no budget movie this thing rocks
i do n't know if america 's gonna like it but we were laughing all the way through
some really funny funny stuff
really nonhollywoodbr br the actors and music rocked
the cars and gags and even the less in your face stuff cracked us up
whooo whooobr br i 've seen some of the actors before but never in anything like this one or two of them i think i 've seen in commercials or in something somewhere
basically it rocked
luckily i got to see a copy from a friend of one of the actors
firsttime director tom kiesche turns in a winning film in the spirit of cutting dark comedy
shot on a shoestring budget yet had the flavor of the early coen brother 's film blood simple and throw in some monty python flavorings to boot
needs to seen more than once to appreciate all the elements that carry one scene to the next
expect more good things to come from this writerdirectoractor
do n't say i did n't warn you but your gonna laugh
probably enough to hurt your stomach
sure it 's got some blood splattering all in good fun though
so it 's got no budget who needs a budget when you got a script like this
br br take the time and check this out
well worth a two hour viewing
if everyone could laugh as much as i did during this movie the world would be a much happier place to livebr br
one of my favorite scenes is at the beginning when guests on a private yacht decide to take an impromptu swim in their underwear
rather risqu for 1931
this was the first movie that joan crawford and clark gable made together and they would go on to make several more
crawford stars a young rich girl who 's father is wiped out in the stock market crash and there is nothing left for her and her brother
they have never worked before and the brother william bakewell gets a job with gable who is a gangster and bakewell thinks it will be an easy job but gets in over his head pretty quick
crawford becomes a reporter at a newspaper but wants to work on the big stories but is given worthless stuff to work on
their is a massacre in which several of gable 's men are killed and crawford was a witness to the whole thing
it 's a good movie but not one of their best
dance fools dance is an early crawfordgable vehicle from 1931 crawford plays a bonnie jordan a wealthy young woman whose life consists of parties booze and stripping off her clothes to jump from a yacht and go swimming
this all ends when her father dies and leaves her and her brother penniless
bonnie gets a job on a newspaper using the name mary smith her brother goes to work for bootleggers
the head man is jake luva portrayed by clark gable as he plays yet another crook
later of course he would turn into a romantic hero but in the early '30s mgm used him as a bad guy
not realizing that her brother is involved in illegal activity bonnie cozies up to luvabr br gable and crawford made a great team
her facial expressions are a little on the wild side but that along with her dancing is one of the things that makes the movie fun
look for cliff edwards the voice of jiminy cricket as bertbr br it 's always interesting to see the precode movies and dance fools dance is no exception
this is one of joan crawford 's best talkies
it was the first gablecrawford pairing and made it evident to mgm and to audiences that they were a sizzling team leading the studio to make seven more films with them as costarsbr br the film convincingly depicts the downward slide of a brother and sister who after their father loses everything in the stock market crash must fend for themselves and work for a living
life is hard in the depression and soon even their attempts at finding legitimate work prove futile and they resort to underworld activity
br br joan crawford is excellent as the socialiteturnedmoll
she 's smart complex and believable
she even tempers the theatrical stiffness of the other actors' early talkie acting style
clark gable is a diamondinthe rough masculine and gruff as the nononsense gangster who becomes involved with crawford 's character
the same year he would play a similar and even more successful role opposite norma shearer in a free soul securing his position as top male sex symbol at mgmbr br if you like crawford in this type of role do n't miss paid which she did a year earlier which is also among her best early talkie performancesbr br
joan crawford had just begun her working girl makes good phase with the dynamic paid
she had never attempted a role like that before and critics were impressed
so while other actresses were wondering why their careers were foundering joan was listening to the public and securing her longevity as an actress
the depression was here and jazz age babies who survived on an endless round of parties were frowned upon
of course if you became rich through immoral means but suffered for it that was alrightbr br this film starts out with a spectacular house boat party
bonnie jordan is the most popular girl there especially when she suggests that everyone go swimming in their underwear
however when bonnie 's father has a heart attack because of loses on the stock market both bonnie and her brother rodney realise who their real friends are
after bob townsend offers to do the right thing and marry her they had just spent a night together when bonnie declared that she wants love on approval she starts to show some character by deciding to get a jobbr br she finds a job at a newspaper and quickly impresses by her will to do well
her working buddy is bert scranton and together they are given an assignment to write about the inside activities of the mob
rodney also surprises her with the news that he also has a job
she is thrilled for him but soon realises it is bootlegging and he is mixed up with cold blooded killer jake luva
rodney witnesses a mass shooting and goes to pieces spilling the beans to the first person he sees drinking at the bar which happens to be bert
he is then forced to kill bert and after wards he goes into hiding
the paper pulls out all stops in an effort to find bert 's killer and sends bonnie undercover as a dancer in one of jake 's clubs
the film ends with a gun battle and as rodney lies dying bonnie tearfully phones in her storybr br this is a super film with crawford and gable giving it their all
natalie moorehead who as sylvie shared a famous cigarette scene with gable early in the film was a stylish other woman who had her vogue in the early thirties
william bakewell had a huge career
a lot of his roles though were weak spineless characters
in this film he played the weak brother and was completely overshadowed by joan crawford and the dynamic newcomer clark gable maybe that was why he never became a starbr br highly recommended
do n't listen to fuddyduddy critics on this one this is a gem
young rich joan and her brother find themselves penniless after their father dies and now they have to work for a living
she naturally becomes a reporter and he just as naturally a driver for the mob
by wild coincidences their careers meet head on thanks to gangster clark gable
in the meantime there is the chance for a moonlight underwear swim for a bunch of pretty young things and for joan to do a couple of risque dance numbers br br but none of this is supposed to be taken seriously it 's all good fun from those wonderful precode days when hollywood was really naughty
joan looks great and displays much of the emotional range that would give her career such longevity
gable is remarkable as a slimy gangster he was n't a star yet and so did n't have to be the hero
great to see him playing something different
and william bakewell is excellent as the poor confused brother
and there are some great montages and tracking shots courtesy of director harry beaumont who moves the piece on with a cracking pace and an occasional wink to the audience
great fun
i disagree strongly with anyone who might dismiss this film as just entertainment
set right after the carefree roaring 20s during the early days of the great depression dance fools dance is at its heart an earnest cautionary tale with a clear message about how best to endure these hard times
yet this fastpaced and tightlyplotted film is far from being a dreary morality talebr br in the 30s hollywood had a knack for churning out one entertaining and enlightening audiencepleaser after another all without wasting a frame of film
dance fools dance one of four films that harry beaumont directed in 1931 is barely 80 minutes long yet its characters are well developed its story never seems rushed and despite its many twists in plot the audience is never left behindbr br with the lone exception of lester vail as flaccid love interest bob townsend the supporting cast is uniformly strong
worthy of note are william bakewell as crawford 's brother cliff edwards as reporter bert scranton and clark gable in an early supporting role as gangster jake luvabr br but this is joan crawford 's film and she absolutely shines in it
made when she was just 27 this lesserknown version of crawford will probably be unrecognizable to those more familiar with her later work
however here is proof that long before she took home an oscar for mildred pierce crawford was a star in the true sense of the word a terrific actress with the charisma to carry a picture all by herselfbr br score eight out of ten
i saw this movie on comedy central a few times
this movie was pretty good
it 's an interesting adventure with the life of sunny davis who is arranged to marry the king of ohtar so that the us can get an army base there to balance power in the middle east
some good jokes including sunnygate
i also just loved the ending theme
it gave me great political spirit
ten out of ten was my rating for this movie
actually goldie hawn is from washington but i digress
this is sort of a mr smith goes to washington type of movie with some variations but the same premise
i taped this movie off of cable years ago because i had a huge crush on goldie hawn
the story is interesting but it 's highly unlikely that some cocktail waitress will get an important job in the government just because she saved some big shot 's life
it made me laugh and made me mad at the same time
it made me laugh because some of the situations she found herself in were so ridiculous i had to laugh
it made me mad to think that our government would set up an average citizen in the manner she was set up
and the speech she made at the end beautiful
too bad not many people have guts like that in real life
sunny a cocktail waitress in the dc area is a bit dim to put in mildly
she drives an old clunker and rents a tiny room from a gay male couple
however she saves the life of a prominent arab by taking a bullet in the behind that was meant for the official
she charms the national press with her zany remarks and her sweet looks
sniffing an opportunity presidential aides get her installed in the protocol department for the us government
even then she messes things up at times but she tries hard and learns a lot
she even grabs the romantic attention of a state department official
but is there another sinister plot in the making involving an arab man who wishes to take another wife
a blonde one
lol lol lol
this movie features goldie as pretty as a picture and as dumb as a fox as they say
sunny learns her way around the jungle of the us government very very well
she even has important things to say about honesty and the lack of it in her protocol surroundings
perhaps the arab community would be less than thrilled with this work but for those who like to laugh rent this today
a pretty average movie but a brave one from ms hawn to promote this vehicle as exec producer as a starring vehicle
although she ends up vindicated she is willing to portray herself as the dizzy bimbo
how many other a listed actresses have subjected themselves to butt injury pratfalls since this movie
not many
does this mean the female butt cannot be funny
goldie surpasses other actresses as she has maintained a screen persona ventures in projects other wo n't
sandra bullock occasionally goes therefor example miss congeniality but nicole kidman would never cop the pratfall
a wonderful performer
great to see some of my favorite actors chris sarandon cliff deyoung notably
beware spoilers
this movie was okay
goldie hawn and chris sarandon were the best two in it
okay so the goofie foreign guy who trades with the biker for his clothes was funny
this guy 's boss was good too
but the movie really belonged to sarandon and hawn
these two should have had a lot more time on screen together
they 're chemistry was great
the bathroom scenewow
romantic sweet yummybr br hawn is a goofy cocktail waitress who saves a foreign man and ends up at the whitehouse in the middle of a plot due to the greed of politicians
to talk about sarandon would be to give a lot away
spoilers this is a rather untypical romanticpolitical comedy and it satisfies both somewhatthe political side a whole lot more than the romantic
it touches on political issues and just barely skims on romantic areasbr br
this is a feelgood movie and nothing more
and for that it is great fun to watch
sure it skims over political issues
but so what
i am sure she was n't trying to make 'good night and good luck' here
let 's not try to make it anything else but what it is light fare
br br and very enjoyable at thatbr br do we remember what 1984 was like
we 've become very sophisticated according to the media as far as what we watch or not
i tend to differ on this point
goldie knew this was funfluff and she went ahead and did itbr br like her lightest fare protocol overboard housesitter wildcats private benjamin seems like old times foul play death becomes her first wives club and the remake of outoftowners goldie knows what she is doing she plays every role for the camp that you can get out of it
goldie just knows herself really well and she knows what she can do really wellbr br she has always made me laugh cheerfully and innocently
i loved her in laughin and every thing she 's ever been in
she has never tried to be anything else but who she is and that 's that bubbling giggly girl next door who happens to be very pretty and has a smile and a laugh that will always endear me and remind me that life is pretty short and you 've just got to lighten up because before you know it you are old wrinkled and suffering from one of life 's inevitable ailments
if it even comes that latebr br i appreciate goldie for what she is a lovable comic actress
protocol is a hitandmiss picture starring goldie hawn as a bubbly cocktail waitress who one night saves the life of a visiting arab from an assassination attempt
the woman immediately becomes a celebrity and gets a new job working for the us government
will the corridors of power in our nation 's capital ever be the same
hawn is excellent as usual even though protocol is n't as funny as her best film private benjamin
but it 's still a good movie and i did laugh alotbr br
the first sidestory in the universal century gundam universe presents a refreshing new look at the war between earth and the space colonies
the focus is no longer on a small group of individuals who would go on to play pivotal roles in the conflict but on the everyday civilian population and how the war is seen through their eyesbr br the story does contain some gundam staples its premise being the attempts by a zeon squad to capture an experimental gundam but it the execution of the plot that made this show so interesting to watch
this series focuses on the experiences of a young boy named alfred and the relationship between his neighbor christina mckenzie who is secretly a federation pilot and a newbie zeon pilot named bernie wiseman
alfred develops a sort of brotherly love for bernie while our young zeon pilot also falls for christinabr br war in the pocket proves that you do not need a sweeping epic tale about special individuals to make for a good war story
there are no uber ace pilots or large scale fleet battles to be seen here
this short 6 episode ova focuses a lot more on character emotional drama over other themes like politics or philosophy and i love how realistically portrayed the characters are
alfred is your typical everyday kid who plays violent computer games and thinks the armed forces is cool
he is then given a crash course in the horrible realities of war
the unlikely friendship and bonding between bernie and christina each not knowing the fact that they are soldiers on different sides of the war is played very real without going overboard with the romance drama stuff
same goes for the endearing relationship between alfred and bernie
that being said i would not want to spoil much of the story here but it makes it a whole lot more heart wrenching to watch the tragedies that unfold as the show moves along all the way to its emotionally devastating twist ending
br br despite its lack of action this show never falls into the category of boring
the characters are just that engaging enough to carry the whole show
not to worry as there are a number of mobile suit action scenes scattered here and there
each are beautifully animated on a level that surpasses that of an ova and are sure to satisfy the craving for some mandatory mobile suit battles in a gundam seriesbr br normally watching anime in japanese or english i would leave up to personal preference
but in this case i strongly recommend the english voice track over the japanese one
not only do the characters whom all except alfred are caucasian sound more believable in english but the performances of the english voice cast are on par and even surpass the japanese one instilling each character with such realistic emotions and intonations that they sound just the acting in some live action tv dramasbr br in short this show does not try to impress the audience
what it does is conveys numerous heartwarming themes that hit closest to home especially the death of innocence on the battlefield and the horrors of war through the eyes of a child
a truly moving little story that deserves more credit than it is being given
when gundam0079 became the movie trilogy most of us are familiar with a lot of it was sheer action and less of anything else
this ova is kinda the opposite
though there 're only half a dozen episodes it is n't filled with action but emotional things
the two main action sequences in this i believe are enough to satisfy me
after seeing so many gundam series movies and ovas i was completely ready for a civilianesquire movie
this movie did a fantastic job of that
what makes this movie stand out is that shows both sides of the war have good and bad people
it made the zeons seem more human rather than the original movies where they 're depicted as the second rise of evil nazis
most people that do n't like anime that i 've forced to watch this movie liked it
so i 'd recommend it to a lot of people just for the antiwar story
if you 're a gundam fan and have n't seen this you should n't be reading this you should already be watching it right now
uc 0079 the one year war is almost at an end
a neutral colony of side 6 has been targeted by cyclops a zeon task force
their target a new gundam being built exclusively for newtypes inside
when little boy al izuruha a fan of zeon ms encounters a zaku after battle breaks out in the colony he befriends newbie ms pilot benard bernie wiseman
the two become good friends al is treated as an honorary member of the cyclops team
through the show bernie acts as a father figure to al and seems to be taken with federation pilot christina mckenzie but eventually they must meet in battle
al soon learns that war is not child 's play and bernie must choose to make the ultimate sacrifice to complete his missionbr br for only 6 episodes gundam 0080 is a well done show
the mobile suits are extremely well designed and the animation may look dated but really shows emotion in the characters
if you liked 0083 then check this one out or if you are new to the gundam world this is a good show to start with
if you look to a show for drama and character development this is the one for you it focuses more on that then mobile suit battle
i would rate it more of a drama than actionbr br mobile suit gundam 0080 war in the pocket
br br sometimes you have to lose to win
if you are uninitiated to the gundam world this is a good place to start
if you are burned out on star wars or star trek here is a compelling realistic scifi series you can become immersed in
not the simplistic boysavesworldingiant robot story you might have expected but rather a complex emotionally compelling space war drama where the line between the good and bad guys is decidedly less than distinctbr br gundam 0080 focuses on the story of al izuruha a young naive boy living in a neutral space colony
he spends his days daydreaming about mobile suits and playing war with his friends
during the course of this series al befriends an enemy soldier bernie wiseman
by the end little al learns some hard lessons about the reality of war and the requisite suffering and sacrificebr br i loved this oav series with its cool mecha designs involving story and likeable characters
i recommend this series to anyone who likes realistic sf anime or to those who think anime is just silly or sexy entertainment
exquisite comedy starring marian davies
young peggy arrives in hollywood seeking stardom
cameo performances showcase all the stars in mgm 's heaven in the famous commissary scene plus lots of vintage film making detail for the scholar
pic also captures for posterity davies' famous wickedly sarcastic impersonations of the top stars of the day br br peggy even catches herself as she encounters the famous star marian davies at tennis turns up her nose and comments ohh i do n't like her
br br my print was perfect
story direction acting an authentic charm and a must for all silent afficinados
there are no people like show people marion davies and william haines
my introduction to ms davies was a clip from this film the delightfully spoofy one in which she lowers a scarf to reveal different emotions
my introduction to mr haines was in viewing this film presently though it 's possible i 've seen him in a less memorable role
haines makes an incredible impression when he joins davies for a commissary meal tossing his hat into the ring with some wonderful bits at the dining table
indeed haines and davies deliver great comic performancesbr br the story starts off with dell henderson driving daughter davies into hollywood certain she will become tinseltown 's newest sensation
indeed davies and the already arrived haines become comedy stars
but davies yearns to become a true drama queen
davies leaves haines and partners up with the dashingly dramatic paul ralli
but audiences prefer davies in more comic roles perhaps director king vidor is offering up a case for art imitating life
br br full of great hollywood location footage both on the set and off
full of great cameos at a studio lunch at the stars' table davies sits between douglas fairbanks and william s hart
the best bit player however is charlie chaplin who has enough nerve to ask davies for her autograph
while the cameos are fun they and the episodic sequences do help show people become less of an important film and more of an important historical document
br br show people king vidor marion davies william haines dell henderson
i finally purchased and added to my collection a copy of show people
i cannot comment any more than what previous viewers have stated and to the characters plot and overall quality of this film without repeating their own words
seeing the cameo outofcharacter appearances of so many mgm silent stars is worth the viewing in and of itself
i really like the scene where marion davies plays herself and is encountered by herself playing the main character of the movie patricia pepoire
make sure you read her lips as there is no title card indicating what she is saying when she sees marion davies but it is something to the effect of i do n't think i like her
pop the corn pop in the tape and get ready to go back more than three quarters of a century in movie making history
enjoy
there are some wonderful things about this movie
marion davies could act given the right property she is wonderful in comedic roles
william haines could act and you can see why he was one of the screen 's most popular leading men
br br the story is a bit trite but handled so beautifully that you do n't notice
king vidor 's direction is one of the principle reasons for this
the producer
the boy genius irving thalbergbr br it 's about movie making and you get to see the process as it was done in 1928 the cameras sets directors directing and actors emoting
you get to see some of the major stars of the day even charlie chaplin does a turn as himself seeking an autograph
you also catch glimpses of eleanor boardman elinor glyn claire windsor king vidor and many others who are otherwise just names and old photographsbr br please even if you 're not a fan of the silents take the time to catch this film when you can
it 's really a terrific trip back in time
marion davies stars in this remarkable comedy show people released by mgm in 1928 davies plays a hick from savannah georgia who arrives in hollywood with her father
the jalopy they arrive in is a hoot as is davies outrageous southern costume
davies lands a job in slapstick comedy not what she wants but it brings her success
she meets fellow slapstick star william haines who is immediately smitten with her
well davies then gets a job at a more prestigious studio and lands a job in stuffy period pieces
a handsome but fake actor shows her the ropes of how to be the typical pretentious hollywood star
davies abandons her slapstick friend and father for the good life but of course learns that is not who she really is
marion davies is wonderful throughout as she outrageously runs the gamut of emotions required of a serious actress
william haines is his usual wonderful comedic self and there are cameos by charles chaplin john gilbert and other famous stars of the day including the director of the film king vidor
this is a silent film with a few sound effects as sound pictures were just coming into their own
a treasure of a film
i'm a huge classic film buff but am just getting in to silent movies
a lot of silent films do n't hold my attention but show people is a notable exceptionbr br marion davies and william haines are simply wonderful in this picture
davies in particular shows a wide range as she morphs from a giggly small town girl to a starlet who takes herself a bit too seriouslybr br show people is a fast paced film with a fantastic array of cameos by some of the biggest stars of the silent era
the movie captured my attention immediately and i actually forgot that it was a silent film
the actors are so skilled in their craft that few dialogue cards are necessarybr br show people is a perfect introduction to silent films
it is a fast paced interesting film with two of the silent era 's best stars
add in the satire of hollywood and show people should be on the 'must see' list for all classic film buffs
1928 is in many ways a lost year in motion pictures
just as some of the finest films of the silent era were being made in every genre sound was coming in and while reaping great profits at the box office was setting the art of filmmaking back about five years as the film industry struggled with the new technologybr br show people is one of the great silent era comedies
the film shows that william haines had comic skills beyond his usual formula of the obnoxious overconfident guy who turns everyone against him learns his lesson and then redeems himself by winning the football game the polo game etc
this movie is also exhibit a for illustrating that marion davies was no susan alexander kane
she had excellent comic instincts and timing
this film starts out as the beverly hillbillieslike adventure of peggy pepper and her father general marmaduke oldfish pepper fresh from the old south
general pepper has decided that he will let some lucky movie studio executive hire his daughter as an actress
while at the studio commissary the peppers run into billy boone a slapstick comedian
he gets peggy an acting job
she 's unhappy when she finds out it is slapstick but she perseveres
eventually she is discovered by a large studio and she and billy part ways as she begins to take on dramatic roles
soon the newfound fame goes to her head and she is about to lose her public and gain a royal title when she decides to marry her new leading man whom she does n't really love unless fate somehow intervenesbr br one of the things mgm frequently does in its late silentera films and in its early soundera films is feature shots of how filmmaking was done at mgm circa 1930 this film is one of those as we get charlie chaplin trying to get peggy 's autograph an abundance of cameos of mgm players during that era including director king vidor himself and even a cameo of marion davies as peggy seeing marion davies as marion davies arriving at work on the lot
peggy grimaces and mentions that she does n't care for her
truly a delight from start to finish this is a silent that is definitely worth your while
this is one of the films that i also recommend you use to introduce people to the art of silent cinema as it is very accessible
i had seen marion davies in a couple of movies and really could n't understand her appeal
she could n't dance for peanuts she did n't attempt to sing and as for her acting she seemed in a trance
but i had n't seen her silent comedies and this film is wonderful
rather than kidding her own image as has been suggested here to me it seems a satire on gloria swanson who did start off in slapstick comedies went on to highly emotional women 's pictures and did end up marrying a count
marion a top mimic also did a funny rabbit imitation whenever she wanted to be seen as grand that was gloria swanson spot on
br br colonel pepper has motored all the way from georgia to hollywood determined to prove that his daughter peggy will be the greatest star ever
their hope dwindles and they are down to their last 40 cents when they meet billy boone who works at the slapstick studios and promises to get peggy a job
peggy thinks she is going to be a great dramatic actress but the studio think she is a fantastic comic
they convince her to make the film and at the preview she is a great success
charlie chaplin asks for her autograph but she does n't recognise him and treats him pretty rudely
who was that short little guy when she finds out she faints
peggy and billy get a call from high art studio but only peggy is wanted and suddenly she is on her way
there is a funny scene where she sees a star she does n't think much of it 's marion davies
br br she finally gets a chance of being a dramatic actress but she ca n't cry
it is a hilarious scene as the director tries everything to get her to cry and when he succeeds she ca n't stop
her new leading man andre convinces her to forget her comedy past and become elite and sophisticated she even adopts a new name patricia pepoire
she also seems to have forgotten billy and her dad she has developed a star personality
when the slapstick studio picks the same location as patricia 's movie billy is thrilled to see her but quite unprepared for her snobby attitude
when she calls him a cheap clown he realises that she is not the girl he once knew
br br after a studio luncheon patricia gets a call from the boss
it seems her films are a flop and no theatres want to book them the public are tired of her mannerisms and want the old peggy back
she and andre decide to get married she dreams of being a countess
on her wedding day billy visits and after a hilarious custard pie fight she realises that billy is the one for herbr br it was amazing to see all the guest stars john gilbert is seen going through the mgm gates lew cody is talking to elinor glynn who not only wrote it but several racy romances that were made into mgm movies
william haines another actor whose movies i had always wanted to see was great especially in the cafeteria scene he had wonderful comic timing
harry gribbon was hilarious as the comedy director there were so many hilarious scenes in this film and marion was at the top of them all i'm giving this film 10 out of 10br br highly highly recommended
back in the day if marion davies had had her druthers and did n't just listen to william randolph hearst she 'd have done more films like show people and been a lot happier
in fact when you see her get her first big break in two reel comedy she 'd have loved to have done that in her career instead of such epics like when knighthood was in flower and janice meredith
br br what you 're seeing by all accounts in show people is the real davies a gifted comedienne a superb mimic and a generous good hearted person
she could really identify with the character of peggy pepper aka patricia prepoire she put up with her share of pretense in her hollywood stardombr br if the plot of show people was set in the legitimate stage you would call it a backstage story
i guess it being one of the first movies about the movies you could call it a behind the camera story
marion is eager young hopeful who arrives in hollywood like so many others looking for that big break
she wants to drama but her introduction to the movies is as the foil for the burlesque comics
she gets her share of pie and seltzer in the face but learns her trade
and also wins the heart of young comic actor william hainesbr br she does get her first big break but it does n't come for haines as well and marion does get to do legitimate drama with actor paul ralli playing andre telfair a pretend no account count of avignon
somebody here was taking a shot at actor lou tellegen lover and husband of sarah bernhardt and geraldine farrar and others and to hear tell of it one of the most despised people in cinemabr br show people was one of the first films to have the unbilled cameo appearances of stars as themselves
you will get to see folks like charlie chaplin douglas fairbanks william s hart mae murray john gilbert eleanor boardman etc just being themselves in and around the film colony
that in itself makes show people a film worth savingbr br show people also made good use of standard tin pan alley songs like ai n't we got fun i'm sitting on top of the world you 'd be surprised california here i come
as the film came out on the cusp of sound being introduced a song called crossroads was introduced in it
it 's not a bad number but no credit is given to the boy and girl singing it in the soundtrack
i guess since they 're not seen it was felt no billing was necessary
still i 'd like to know and i'm sure you would to if you are fortunate enough to see show peoplebr br it 's easy to see why marion davies liked this film so much and considered it a personal favorite
she looks so at home in this film and her real life lack of pretense shines through in her performance which makes it a real treat for the audience
prior to seeing show people my impression of silent comedy was essentially slapstick and slapstick only
i could not imagine how screen comedy could be possible without relying heavily on spoken word or numerous pratfalls
but this masterful film proved me wrong
davies in my view was probably the greatest comedic actress to come along prior to lucille ball
i mention lucy primarily because davies' mannerisms and facial expressions reminded me of her to the point that i wonder if davies was n't one of ball 's primary influences
this is coming from a 21 year old who had never before seen silent comedy and i must say that no matter how much of the periodspecific references you actually get you will not be bored by this movie
you will probably even laugh more than you would at most talkie comedies
this is not only my favorite silent comedy but easily among my ten favorite comedies of all time
sunday july 16 800pm the castro san franciscobr br as a southern colonel your makeup is very indianabr br the yammering gossips of hollywood have managed to sling more than a little mud in marion davies direction over the years
that she had fame handed to her and was undeserving is often speculated
considering the mawkish dramas she was so often pushed into this criticism would seem to have some validity
as a comedienne however her star shone very brightly
left to pursue a career in light comedy and slapstick she might have rivaled mabel normand
one of her better outings was king vidor 's show people which survives and is so well known largely because mgm filled it with star cameos
this happy coincidence inadvertently saved what is surely among the best work of its two stars davies and that notorious joe college wisecracker william haines
rumor has it show people was loosely based on the life of gloria swanson who began in sennett comedies and rose to grand drama with von stroheim walsh and demille
coincidentally the comedy studios used in this film are the original digs keystone had abandoned the year before br br colonel marmaduke oldfish pepper drives his daughter peggy from georgia to hollywood to star in the movies
these two country hicks are unsuspecting fodder for incorrigible billy boone a custard pie artist who descends on their cafeteria table in an outrageously funny entrance and then helps peggy land a part in his next picture
what she thinks is high drama turns out to be screwball but a job is a job and billy convinces her
all the stars have to take it on the chin
at the preview billy and peggy bump into charlie chaplin who asks for her autograph
she pushes the little fellow aside and a horrified billy grabs the book and makes her sign
chaplin climbs in his car and billy tells peggy who shes just snubbed so naturally she faints
it 's so very funny considering davies character is n't supposed to recognize this guy
peggy soon moves on to work at the high art studios changes her name to 'patricia pepoire' and leaves poor billy behind
davies does a wonderful sendup of a serious actress with all the prerequisite fluttering eyelashes and quivering lips
vidor throws in a parade of stars eating lunch in a long tracking shot that includes polly moran louella parsons estelle taylor claire windsor aileen pringle the comedy duo of karl dane and george k arthur leatrice joy renee adoree rod la rocque mae murray john gilbert norma talmadge and patricia dressed like marie antoinette sandwiched between douglas fairbanks and william s hart
billy runs into the high art crew on location when the comedy troupe disrupts their filming with predictably nutty results
vidor even works himself into the final scene as the director of peggy 's current production
also worth noting are harry gribbon as the comedy director doing a great caricature of eddie sedgwick sidney bracy as the dramatic director who ca n't get peggy to cry for her screen test and then ca n't stop her once she does and paul ralli as andre her dramatic love interest and a hilarious phony
when her character tries to 'act' its as though davies is poking fun at all the awful dramas she 'd been forced into and she 's brilliant doing itbr br while it 's true show people is a hokey satire of the 'good ole days' ten years hence it remains a highly entertaining example of quality work from mgm irving thalberg and their tremendous wealth of assembled talent
what a shame so much has been lost
there are also far too many examples of great films like the patsy vidor and davies' hugely successful comedy from earlier that same year languishing in vaults when they could be seen and enjoyed
perhaps the funniest 'backstage at hollywood' movie ever especially for a look at comedy short factories like keystonebr br marion davies should get a medal for bravery for taking a part where acting poorly in front of a camera is part of the role
plenty of cameos for film buffs
show people is an absolutely delightful silent directed by king vidor and starring marion davies and billy haines
what gems both of them are in this charming comedy about a young girl peggy pepper whose acting is the talk of savannah trying to make it on the big screen
though she 's a success in comedy what she wants to do is make art so she moves up to high arts studio
soon she becomes patricia pepoire and is too good for the likes of her friend billybr br many stars of the silent era have cameos in show people including davies herself without the curly hair and makeup
i'm sure when people saw the film in 1928 they recognized everyone who appeared in the elaborate lunch scene sadly nowadays it 's not the case even for film buffs
in one part of the film however she does meet charlie chaplin in another author elinor glyn is pointed out to her and vidor himself has a cameo at the end of the film
other stars who pop up in show people are john gilbert douglas fairbanks william s hart leatrice joy bess flowers renee adoree rod laroque aileen pringle and many othersbr br davies was adorable and a lively comedienne
it 's a shame william haines quit the movies he was cute and energetic deservedly an enormous star back in the daybr br show people is a simple story told in a witty way
it 's also a look back at an exciting era in hollywood 's history and contains performances by two wonderful stars
this for me was a wonderful introduction to the talents and beauty of marion davies
she is not only gorgeous but hilarious in this film
vidor 's direction is light but surehanded the story is a chestnut of course but the acting is marvelously contemporary and the starwatching element for fans of the silent era with many cameos adds to the overall fun
it combines the elements of slapstick with adult drama and good old timeless romance quite well
for all movie fans who have a kneejerk reaction to watching silent films sit through this one and it may change your attitude
br br
wisecracker the biography of actor william haines offers a gratifying anecdote about the former star when he was past 70 and long retired from making movies
the old gent was not sentimental and rarely watched his own films but in 1972 he was persuaded to attend a los angeles museum screening of show people the late silent feature in which he costarred with marion davies
beforehand haines was worried that this comedy would provoke the wrong kind of laughter but he was pleasantly surprised at how well it held up and how much the young audience enjoyed it
watch the film today and you can see why show people is a delightful hollywood satire that retains its charm because it lampoons its targets with wit and flair yet without malice
it 's still funny and its satirical points still resonate
needless to say the technology of moviemaking has changed vastly since the silent days but the pretensions and follies of the filmmakers themselves have n't changed all that muchbr br show people also stands as the best surviving work of marion davies a firstrate comic performer who deserves a prominent place in the pantheon of great comediennes
where her career was concerned davies was both blessed and cursed by the patronage of her paramour the newspaper magnate william randolph hearst
it 's well known that hearst exerted enormous influence over davies' choice of roles and well known too that despite her gift for comedy he preferred to see her play dignified heroines in period costume dramas
by the late '20s for whatever reason marion was permitted to strut her stuff in several exuberant light comedies but show people directed by the great king vidor stands as her most enjoyable showcase
william haines gives an engaging likable performance as her boyfriend and costar billy boone but this is the leading lady 's show all the waybr br marion plays southern belle peggy pepper an aspiring actress who storms hollywood accompanied by her father determined to become a movie star
one of marion 's funniest bits often excerpted elsewhere is her audition at the comet studio casting office
while dad helpfully suggests emotions to portray and drops a handkerchief across her face peggy assumes the appropriate expression and posture
she 's hired only to discover that comet makes lowbrow comedies the kind of comedies where people squirt each other with seltzer and inept cops tumble over each other racing to the rescue
of course comet is intended as a takeoff of mack sennett 's keystone but the true nature of the satire becomes clear as the story unfolds
as peggy pepper rises in the movie star hierarchy she leaves comet for the more prestigious high art studio assuming the name patricia peppoire as more befitting her new station in life as a serious actress
at some point it may occur to us that davies' rival gloria swanson started out in keystone comedies before rising to prominence in serious dramas for cecil b demille
and as miss peppoire takes herself more and more seriously giving the highhat treatment to former colleagues such as lowly comic billy boone davies' performance takes on an element of wicked parody seemingly aimed squarely at swanson herself
this is especially notable during an interview sequence when miss peppoire 's spokesman spouts pretentious nonsense while the star delivers a spoton impersonation of swanson
i suppose this was intended as a friendly spoof but i have to wonder how friendly relations were between gloria and marion after this movie was releasedbr br in any event show people is a delicious treat for buffs who will relish the parade of star cameos throughout
charlie chaplin contributes a nice bit sans makeup and looking quite distinguished eagerly seeking patricia peppoire 's autograph
this is a silent film that viewers not especially attuned to silents might appreciate at least those viewers with a taste for movies about the movie business
show people surely belongs in the company of such classics as sunset boulevard and singin' in the rain among hollywood 's most expertly produced enjoyable exercises in amused selfexamination
oh it 's so cool to watch a silent classic once in while
director vidor is simply delightful and even makes a lengthy cameo as himself
the story is about having success in life and the way it changes you
marion davies plays a girl that leaves its friends in a little comedy studio to be part of a larger drama studio
she becomes a big star and the consequences are she really alienates from the real world
for a moment she even denies her past
the cameos are simply hilarious certainly the scene where the main character sees marion davies in the studios and concludes she does n't seem that special it 's got to be one of the first movieinthemovies here and for real freaks it 's awesome to see the cameras and material from way back then
a mustsee if you ask me
i 've seen hundreds of silent movies
some will always be classics but among them my favorite is this film
in fact when i looked it up on imdb i noticed i immediately laughed to myself because the movie was so goshdarn cute and wellmade
marion davies proved with this movie she really had great talent and was not just william randolph hearst 's mistressbr br the story involves a hick from georgia coming to hollywood with every expectation that she would be an instant star
her experiences and the interesting cameos of stars of the era make this a real treat for movie buffs and a mustsee
updated from a previous comment
the great and underrated marion davies shows her comedic stuff in this late silent comedy that also showcases the wonderful william haines
davies plays a hick from georgia who crashes hollywood with help from haines a bit player in crude comedies
they appear together in cheap comedies until marion is discovered and becomes a big dramatic starbr br a great lampoon on hollywood and its pretensions
davies haines are a wonderful team and the guest shots from the likes of charlie chaplin douglas fairbanks william s hart john gilbert elinor glyn norma talmadge mae murray rod larocque leatrice joy dorothy sebastian estelle taylor louella parsons renee adoree aileen pringle and marion davies are a hoot
a must for any serious film buff or for anyone interested in the stillmaligned marion davies
dell henderson plays the father
polly moran is a maid
paul ralli is the slimy leading manbr br show people was said to have used the career of gloria swanson as its model

but this film 's story does parallel the rise of swanson from onereel mack sennett comedies with charlie chaplin to star in cecil b demille films of the late teens and early 20sbr br davies and haines were huge mgm stars and friends
odd that mgm never teamed them up in a talkie

a give this movie a 1010 because it deserves a 1010
two of the best actors of their timewalter matthau george burns collaborate with neil simon and all of the other actors that are in this film director herbert ross and all of that makes this stage adaption come true
the sunshine boys is one of the best films of the 70 's
i love the type of humor in this film it just makes me laugh so hardbr br i got this movie on vhs 3 days ago
i watched it as soon as i got home but i had to watch it again because i kept missing a few parts the first time
the second time i watched it it felt a lot better and i laughed a lot harder
i'm definitely going to reget this on dvd because i have to see the special featuresbr br it 's very funny how that happens
two people work together as entertainersactorsperformers
they get along well on stage but really argue off stage they ca n't survive another minute with each other then some 15 years later you want to reunite them for a tv special
you can find that in this film
matthau burns were terrific in this film
it 's a damn shame they died
george burns deserved that oscar
he gave a strong comic performance
he was also 78 when this movie was filmed
so far he 's the oldest actor to receive an academy award at an old age
jessica tandy breaks the record as the oldest actress
richard benjamin was also fantastic in this
he won a golden globe for best supporting actor
he deserved that golden globe
although many people might disagree with what i am about to say everybody in this film gave a strong performance
this comedy is an instant classic
i highly recommend it
one more thing whoever hates this film is a putz
the neil simon 's sunshine boys starring walter matthau and george burns is a funny comedy on the strange bond to the life and its shortness but the laughter always bitter taste
seeing willy clark and al lewis two big theatrical comedy actors now reduced on the imbecility from the hard and unceasing old age you can feel only anger and blue
willy not ever surrender and continue to look work while al is tired for players and he is retired to the country in the house to his daughter
the couple in his old time was truly funny and harmony but out the scene was a continue squabble and to quarrel and for eleven years after their broken they not talk between
now if they would work they must return together another time for do one of his best old sketch for a comedy story tv show
the meets is explosive and liberating for the old questions
the neil simon 's screenplay give a certain corrosive spirit to the story and the melancholy and blue overwhelming the many gags and laughter succeeded to generate a good mix also thanks to a great couple walter matthu and george burns
the two actors are very believable and real and the their harmony seems almost as they real work together for all that time and that realty they not bear between them
the movie is very touching also for its all consuming reality as the story is narrate and how the report loveheat that bind the two actors is totally real part to the strange but at the same time ordinarily comprehensible things to the life
my rate is 7
first off i dislike almost all neil simon movies
but there is something about this that is unique that draws me in and i would say it is among the most entertaining comedies i have seen
the second time i watched it the connection was clear
when did neil simon meet my grandmothers
br br ah afraid they might sue so he changed them into men
and how dull would it be if they were only housewives show biz stars is more fun
well this is a personal review and my still living grandmother at age 97 would deny it but some of you must find resonance in these charactersbr br secondly i have little tolerance for george burns but somehow he turned in one of the finest supporting performances i can recall br br very ethnic in flavor and over the top you will either laugh and laugh or turn this off
for me the pleasure lingers
first an explanation despite my headline i'm giving this film only 8 stars because overall this is not one of the best films ever made
all the criticisms registered here have valid points
also be warned that to enjoy the script you really need to appreciate neil simon 's brilliance with finding the wit within real human banter
he does have a distinctively new york ear for dialogue especially dry jewish lovesuffused sarcasm and if you have trouble accepting sarcasm as an expression of love then you might have trouble accepting the optimism at the heart of this moviebr br so much for warnings
here 's my main point walter matthau is flatout perfect even beyond perfect in this movie
i have never seen him funnier or more touching for that matter because at the same time that he shows us the hilariousness of this character who refuses to give up his big star selfimage or insufferable attitudes even as his coherence is in decline he also shows us the more vulnerable maybe even heartbreakingly scared person inside the grouch
and he only barely shows us that sad part it 's just enough to really get to you if you happen to be coping with your own father 's or husband 's mental decline right now but artistically it 's just enough pathos to give this character the most authentically deep roots i'm seen in possibly any film performance
this is beyond method acting matthau 's performance is exquisite as character work and a pure delight as comic delivery
this is a masterpiece of comic actingbr br about richard benjamin i personally find his acting annoying in general and his work in this movie is no exception although he has some fine moments here
so if you like him you should like him here and if you do n't this movie wo n't change your mindbr br about the 1976 oscars i agree that matthau was unfortunate to be up against nicholson in cuckoo 's nest that year
it was a killer year for leadingactor competition if only there were separate oscars for comedy and drama then i think the best actor oscars would have gone to al pacino for dog day afternoon and to walter matthau for the sunshine boys not to dis jack 's fine work as mcmurphy but i think that pacino and matthau were each clearly more masterful and astoundingly effective and downright legendary in their performances than nicholson was that year
also i believe that burns got the supporting actor oscar more for sentimental reasons than for the quality of his performance i mean he was good in this movie but not that good
br br oscar theories aside here 's my bottom line review if you like matthau 's comic acting then see this movie and savor his powerhouse tirades and wonderful grandmotherinspired gestures fleeting facial expressions and seemingly unscripted asides
i'm 14 so you probably would think i have never heard of george burns or walter matthau or anyone like that
boy are you wrong
i had heard that george burns was in this movie and that he won an academy award for it
i have been a fan of george burns since i was ten
i saw the movie oh god recently and loved it
this one was also very awesome
george burns did a great job
so did walter matthau
and even though they had really small roles phyllis diller and steve allen did a good job
that special they were filming would have been awesome if it was really done
let me say this if you are a fan of george burns or walter matthau you should see this movie right away
at first this looked like a boring comedy like the odd couple but when i got into it it turned out to be a really funny film
basically forgetful excomedians willy clark and al lewis were a great comedy duo and a brought back together to revive their hospital sketch for a tv show
willy 's nephew ben clark is confident they can get together again with no hard feelings for each other how wrong he is
they cannot get on all the time they are both forgetful especially during conversation but they do it eventually
also starring lee meredith as nurse in sketch carol deluise as mrs doris green al 's daughter rosetta lenoire as odessa willy 's nurse and muppets from space 's f murray abraham as mechanic
i think the best line of the film is burns mentioning that matthau called him a son of a bitch bastard
it was nominated the oscars for best art directionset decoration and best writing screenplay adapted from other material it was nominated the bafta for best screenplay and it won the golden globe best motion picture musicalcomedy and it was nominated for best screenplay
very good
the sunshine boys is a terrific comedy about two exvaudevillians who reluctantly reunite for a tv special despite the fact that they despise each otherbr br the comic genius of two masters at work george burns and walter matthau are stellar
some of the best scenes are when the duo is fighting over the silliest little trivial things
the material is fastpaced and witty appealing to all agesbr br mild spoiler alert there are some mildly sad moments toward the end of the movie that deal indirectly with the affects of aging that gives the film a soft sincere tenderness that shows to this reviewer that what the pair really need the most for success are each otherbr br if anyone loves the odd couple you 'll adore this movie
an excellent film
walter matthau and george burns just work so well together
the acidity of willy with the perplexed amnesic al is a mixture made in heaven
the scene when they meet again in willy 's flat is a gem and the final scene rounds up the film to perfection
walter matthau gives a superb performance as the irascible semiretired comedian as only he can the intonation in the voice and the exaggerated dramatics coupled with his general misunderstanding of what is going on form a great characterization
george burns timing is legendary and nowhere was it better than in this film his calm aplomb with desert dry replies are memorable
watch for the scene near the end when al and his daughter ask something of the spanish caretaker and al 's reaction priceless
two great comedians in a great neil simon movie based on his hit playbr br great combination especially when the comedians in question are matthau and burns
small wonder why burns won an oscar for this he 's as sharp and as funny as ever
and matthau is every bit his match if a tad more crotchetybr br this is familiar simon territory two old vaudeville partners reunite for a tv special but still ca n't stand one another after all these yearsbr br it 's a delight to watch these two pick at each other their scenes together make this film an absolute delight
myself i especially enjoyed the knock knock knock enter
scene
and if you 're a fan of either burns or matthau you 'll enjoy it toobr br in fact you 'll enjoy the whole movie
br br ten stars
put a little sunshine in your life
as a study of the frailties of human nature in the context of old age this film is without parallel
it is quite simply brilliant
full marks to everyone from the scriptwriter to all involved in the finished product
you can only marvel at the perceptions inherent in the characterisation of the two ageing performers
much like the comedy duo of its title the sunshine boys has become a forgotten classic 30odd years later
it 's hardly mentioned alongside other great film comedies of the 1970s
this makes no sense given the singular specialness of this film perhaps the best neil simon ever wrotebr br walter matthau plays willy clark once half of a legendary vaudeville comedy known as lewis and clark now a bitter 73yearold solo act who ca n't get a job in a potato chip commercial
his nephew and agent ben is sure he can get work if willy will only agree to reunite with his estranged partner al lewis for an abctv celebration of show business nostalgiabr br nostalgia is what sunshine boys has going for it in spades right from the start when a series of 1920s film clips showcasing various entertainers from long ago flickers before us to the accompaniment of cole porter 's be a clown
then there 's the film 's presentday setting in manhattan where flared trousers and wide polyester ties abound
the periods collide in willy 's glorious mess of a manhattan apartment where framed photos and cartoons of longdead celebrities stare out from the walls at lurid tabloid headlines and empty zabar grocery bags
if you were alive in the 1970s like me you might even feel like you were in that apartmentbr br willy clearly has been living there too long
he 's sleeping in front of the television when the kettle in the other room boils
willy wakes up and picks up the phonebr br hello who is this
a pause
never mind it 's the tea
br br old men living alone can be sad material in almost anyone else 's hands but simon 's deft wit and unerring feeling for character turns this adaptation of his 1972 stage hit into comedy gold
the amazing thing about the sunshine boys is how much it rubs your noses in willy 's almost existential condition without turning you off at all
89 years old and just like that he dies of nothing' willy says of one old songwriting friend before deciding the man probably died from writing a song that rhymed lady with babybr br burns won an oscar for his understated performance as the gentle but steely lewis but it 's matthau who brings this one home his makeup and proud but ragged bearing really selling you on the idea he was already 73 when he made this
willy is obnoxious in the extreme fully deserving ben 's description crazy freakin' old man but you root for him throughout enjoying his small victories even when they come at the cost of others' patience
his lines kill you too especially when he 's trying to kill lewis for whom the tv reunion turns out to be a bad ideabr br you 're out of touch
willy tells lewis at one point
i'm still in demand
i'm still hot
br br if this room was on fire you would n't be hot lewis repliesbr br director herbert ross shoots everything in a very casual and understated way with low lighting and midrange shots even in emotional moments so as to leave room for the comedy and the film 's overall zen message of grace through quiet acceptance
you never get the feeling you are watching a movie one of the sunshine boys many charms and ross 's direction like the acting of the three principals goes a long way toward achieving that endbr br comedy is hard especially when the subjects are people watching life pass them by but the sunshine boys makes it all seem a pleasure because for us watching it is
walter matthau and george burns were a famous vaudeville comedy act lewis and clark who have n't spoken in over 10 years
burns retired and matthau took it personally and has held a grudge ever since
such is the premise of this hilarious neil simon play made into a movie
of course what makes it so good is matthau and burns in their prime and the material is funnier than anything you can find today
richard benjamin shines as matthau 's nephew and agent
there 's even old clips of actual stars of the golden era to get you into the groove of the film and character actor fritz feld starts it all off with a pop
rosetta lanoire who started out in the 30s in theater with orson welles and later was grandma on family matters is great in a small rolebr br the only problem i had with it is the way matthau treats burns when they first meet
granted he 's had a lot of resentment festering in all these years but some of the things he does would be considered rude or just plain bad manners taken out of context
also i'm used to seeing matthau act that way in other movies but not to george burns
and matthau 's bellowing tends to get a little old
br br all in all if you need a consistently funny film to help and forget your troubles put in the sunshine boys
they 'll lift your spirits and make you think of a simpler time and way of lifebr br benjamin you have to slide it
br br matthau wait wait
i think you have to slide it
an old vaudeville team of willy clark and al lewis were one of the best known but they broke up hating each other
over 20 years later they agree to get together for a tv special but find out they still hate each other
willy 's nephewagent tries to get them to work togetherbr br a big hit in its day and it won george burns an oscar for best supporting actor
i liked it
it was written by neil simon so its nonstop oneliners
some of it was funny but making jokes of willy and al 's senility was not
also i never liked matthau
i never thought he was a good actor and something about him just rubbed me the wrong way
also his character here is so caustic you get sick of him quickly
all that aside this was fun
burns is just great tossing off oneliners with ease and even matthau was good matching him
their verbal battles are the best sequences in the movie
also benjamin is very good as willy 's nephew trying to get the two of them to work with each other
for me it 's worth seeing for burns alone
this jump started his career in a big way and two years later he had another hit with oh god
so this is good
just goodnot great
matthau 's character really makes this hard to love
i give it a 7
the word 'classic' is thrown around too loosely nowadays but this movie well deserves the appelation
the combination of neil simon walter matthau and the late lamented george burns make for a comic masterpiece
it is interesting to contemplate what the movie would have been like had not death prevented jack benny from playing george burns' part as had been planned
as it is the reunion scene in matthau 's apartment is not likely to be surpassed as a sidesplitter
definitely one of my desert island filmsbr br enter
question how do you steal a scene from the expert of expert scene stealers walther mathau in full furious and brilliant grumpy old man mode
answer quietly deadpan and with perfect timing as george burns does herebr br i know nothing of vaudeville but this remains a favourite film the two leads are hilarious the script funny the direction and pacing very fine
richard benjamin is very funny as straight man trying to get at burns through the window etc
even the small parts are greatbr br there are so many funny scenes mathau messing up the commercial burns repeating his answers as if senile br br a delightbr br enterrrrrr
the sunshine boys was the hilarious 1975 screen adaptation of neil simon 's play about a retired vaudevillian team played by walter matthau and george burns who had a very bitter breakup and have been asked to reunite one more time for a television special or something like that
the problem is that the two still hate each other and want nothing to do with each other
richard benjamin appears as matthau 's nephew a theatrical agent who has been given the monumental responsibility of making this reunion a reality
this warm and winning comedy is a lovely valentine to a forgotten form of entertainment vaudeville and it works mainly thanks to one of neil simon 's better screenplays and outstanding work by matthau burns and benjamin
burns won the best supporting actor oscar for this but i think matthau walks away with this film with his flawlessly hilarious performance as willy clark
matthau was nominated for best actor but did n't stand a chance against nicholson for one flew over the cuckoo 's nest however in another year this was an oscarworthy performance
matthau commands the screen and there is not a false note in this beautifully timed performance
the scene where he is auditioning for a potato chip commercial and ca n't get the name of the product right is a classic
the sunshine boys is a warm and winning neil simon comedy which shines thanks to unbeatable chemistry between matthau and burns
taking over roles that jack albertson and sam levene played on broadway walter matthau and george burns play a couple of old time vaudeville comics a team in the tradition of joe smith and charles dale who seem to have a differing outlook on lifebr br walter matthau ca n't stop working the man has never learned to relax take some time and smell the roses
he 's a crotchety old cuss whose best days are behind him and his nephew and agent richard benjamin is finding less and less work for him
br br what hurt him badly was that some 15 years earlier his partner george burns decided to retire and spend some time with his family
a workaholic like matthau ca n't comprehend it and take burns 's decision personallybr br benjamin hits on a brain storm reunite the guys and do it on a national television special
what happens here is pretty hilariousbr br the sunshine boys is also a sad bittersweet story as well about old age
matthau is on screen for most of the film but it 's burns who got the kudos in the form of an oscar at the ripe old age of 79br br burns brought a bit of the personal into this film as well
as we all know he was the straight man of the wonderful comedy team of burnsallen who the monty python troop borrowed a lot from
in 1958 due to health reasons gracie allen retired and george kept going right up to the age of 100 or at least pretty close to as an active performerbr br the sunshine boys is based on the team of smithdale however and if you like the sunshine boys i strongly recommend you see two tickets to broadway for a look at a pair of guys who were entertaining the american public at the turn of the last century
the doctor sketch that matthau and burns do is directly from their materialbr br and i do think you will like the sunshine boys
simon 's carefully written dialogues are truly electrified by matthau and burns
you can literally hear the script crackle
there are few movies out there that can develop such a relationship between the actors and the script
for example the famed reunion scene could have been a lot duller with lessquality actors involved
matthau seems to had been born to play willie clark and with all of the little idiosyncracies and mannerisms that matthau crams into the character make this one of the best performances i 've ever seen of any actor in any role be it comedic or drama or whatever else
period
matthau and burns work excellently together the contrast they portray accentuates simon 's superb knack at creating comedic conflict
this movie is simply one of the ultimate mustsees and does demand a rightful prestigious place in the pages of film history
neil simon 's the odd couple set up a model for many of his later plays
felix unger and oscar madison were the unsuitably paired roommates in the original the former being picky and neat the latter being slovenly and loose
simon would rewrite the play in the 1990s as the new odd couple with female roommates
he made it a mixed couple in the goodbye girls
he also gave it an additional twist in 1973 with the sunshine boys a broadway hit starring jack alberson and sam levine as al lewis and willie clark the aged semiretired vaudevillians
here the apartment problem is reduced to a teaming of two men who ca n't stand each other
the 1976 film starred walter matthau as willie and george burns as albr br in actuality al probably does not think totally badly of willie willie is pathological on the subject of al
first al had little habits such as accidentally spitting slightly when pronouncing words beginning with the letter t and slightly jabbing willie with his index finger on stage
secondly al retired when his wife died
willie was not ready to retire to try to get him jobs in commercials
but willie ca n't remember lines unless they are funny and keeps flubbing them
so he rarely is able to stay to the end of a rehearsal for a commercialbr br ben is asked to get the two back together for a live scene of their most famous sketch on a television show about american comedy
he does bring al to see willie and the sparks begin flying as neither can figure out what the other is doing such as saying enter
when al knocks on the door
the initial rehearsal is a failure but ben manages to get them to the taping of the show
the question is if they will complete the scene in the finished program or will willie wring al 's neckbr br the three leads matthau burns and benjamin do very well with the oneliners frequently reminiscent of vaudeville patter
benjamin strives to prove his deep affection for his uncle although matthau 's rough outer shell makes it difficult
matthau has a little better grasp on reality than burns who seems senile by his repeating himself but in actuality matthau 's sense of rejection by the world that once applauded him make him less willing to behave properly
burns is not senile he takes things slowly
but he seems far happier in accepting his retirementbr br i call this a final voyage of discovery for our modern lewis and clark
al and willie transcend their old skits as they gradually end up realizing that they have more in common in their old age than they thought
even the irascible willie admits that al may be a pain in the ass but he was a funny manbr br burns was not the original choice for the part of al lewis
jack benny was
benny probably would have done a good job but illhealth forced him out
burns turned in such a fine performance that he got the oscar for best supporting actor and was to have a career in movies in the next decade in such films as oh god
oh god you devil and going in style
he died in 1996 age 100 having proved that he was more than just a brilliant straight man for his wife gracie allan
i remember originally seeing this film at radio city music hall when it came out
i did n't really understand the humor back then but this movie can make me laugh out loudbr br with all due respect to george burns walter matthau really deserved the oscar for this film
his performance is amazinggiven the fact that he was 20 years younger than his character willie clark
his mannerisms are firstrate
absolutely hilariousbr br kudos to richard benjamin who played straight man to matthaubr br i just wish this was on dvd because my vhs recording is getting a bit oldbr br i had no interest in seeing the remake with woody allen because in no way can it match the original
a hilarious neil simon comedy that evokes laughs from beginning to end
the late walter matthau is the grouchy excomedian who is persuaded to join together with his expartner for a final reunion show on stagebr br benjamin martin is matthau 's agent and nephew and the two have just as much chemistry as matthau and burns
i love matthau 's grumpy characterhe 's just the same as he always is and yet also very differentbr br burns as the absentminded old man is just as funny as matthaubr br matthau want some crackers
i 've got coconut pineapple and grahambr br burns how about a plain crackerbr br matthau i do n't got plain
i got coconut pineapple and grahambr br burns okaybr br matthau they 're in the cupboard in the kitchenbr br burns maybe laterbr br or how about thisbr br matthau when i did black the whites knew what i was sayingbr br you 've got to see it in the movie to understand itbr br all in all a refreshingly hilarious sweet heartfelt warm belivable character comedy with a heart and some of the most memorable quotes of all time
br br they just do n't make them like this anymore
in a time when all the newest comedies are crude juvenile and stupid this leans back towards the tender core of what comedy really isfunny characters smart and funny dialogue and grand entertainmentbr br one of the best buddy comedies of all time right up there with planes trains and automobiles lethal weapon and the hard way
br br you may have a hard time finding this for rent or on tv but trust me it will be worth your timebr br 455 starsbr br john ulmer
in one of neil simon 's best plays
creaky cranky exvaudeville stars played by walter matthau and george burns are teaming up for a tv comedy special
the problem is they have n't even seen each other in over a decade
full of zippy one liners and inside showbiz jokes this story flies along with a steady stream of humor
good work also by richard benjamin as the harried nephew rosetta lenoire as the nurse and howard hesseman as the tv commercial director
steve allen and phyllis diller appear as themselves
trivia note the opening montage contains footage from hollywood revue of 1929 and shows marie dressler bessie love polly moran cliff edwards charles king gus edwards and the singing brox sisters
the sunshine boys is one of my favorite feel good movies
i first saw it when it as the christmas attraction at radio city music hall when it first came out and loved it ever since
i ended up seeing it 6 times in the theaters and if it was playing today i 'd go out to see it againbr br now a lot of the reviews here mentioned the wonderful performances of the leads
matthau was brilliant but had the misfortune of being nominated against jack nicholson 's oscar winning performance of randall p macmurphy in one flew over the cuckoo 's nest
burns did win though richard benjiman deserved at least to be nominated as well
even the smallest roles were played to perfection like fritz feld auditioning for the potato chips commercial
br br which brings me to my reason for reviewing this film the direction of the greatly underrated herbert ross
ross who previously brought a two person play the owl and the pussycat to the screen and made a full movie out of it does it again
he opens the plays out without making them look like a photographic stage play
he fleashens out the story and the charactersbr br here we 're 20 minutes into the film before we get to the scene that opens the play where ben clark comes to see his uncle and tell him about the comedy special
though there are dialogue from the play during the first twenty minutes the sequence itself is totally new
a few years ago i did see at the broadway revival of the play with jack klugman and tony randall which was wonderful
but i think that ross and screenwriter playwright simon improved on it
it 's just a wonderful film
this film reminds me of 42nd street starring bebe daniels and ruby keeler
when i watch this film a lot of it reminded me of 42nd street especially the character eloise who 's a temperamental star and she ends up falling and breaks her ankle like bebe daniels did in 42nd street and another performer gets the part and become a star
this film like most race films keeps people watching because of the great entertainment
race films always showed black entertainment as it truly was that was popular in that time era
the dancing styles the music dressing styles you 'll love it
this movie could of been big if it was made in hollywood it would of had better scenery better filming and more money which would make any movie better
but its worth watching because it is good and micheaux does good with the little he has
i have to say out of all micheaux 's films swing is the best
the movie features singers dancers actresses and actors who were popular but forgotten today
doli armena a awesome female trumpet player who can blow the horn so good that you think gabriel is blowing a horn in the sky
the sexy hot female dancer consuela harris would put ann miller and gyspy rose lee to shamebr br adding further info popular blues singer of the 20 's and 30 's cora green is the focus of the film she 's mandy a good hard working woman with a no good man who takes her money and spend it on other women
a nosy neighbor played by amanda randolph tells mandy what she seen and heard and mandy goes down to the club and catches her man with an attractive curvy woman by the name of eloise and a fight breaks out
then mandy goes to harlem where she reunites with a somewhat guardian angel lena played by one of the most beautiful women in movies dorothy van engle
lena provides mandy with a home a job and helps her become a star when temperamental cora smith tries to ruin the show with her bad behavior
when cora gets drunk and breaks her leg lena convinces everyone that mandy is right for the job and lena is right and a star is born in mandy
tall long lanky but handsome carman newsome is the cool aspiring producer who lena looks out for as well
pretty boy larry seymour plays the no good man but after lena threatens him he might shape up
there are a few highlights but the one that sticks out to me is the part where cora smith struts in late for rehearsal and goes off on everyone and then her man comes in and punches her in the jaw but that 's not enough she almost gets into a fight with mandy again
in between there 's great entertainment by chorus girls tap dancers shake dancers swing music and blues singing
there 's even white people watching the entertainment i wonder where micheaux found them there 's even a scene where there 's blacks and whites sitting together at the club micheaux frequently integrated blacks and whites in his films he should be commended for such a bold movebr br this movie was the first race film i really enjoyed and it helped introduced me to oscar micheaux
this movie is one of the best of the race film genre its a behind the scenes story about the ups and downs of show businessbr br no these early race films may not be the best ca n't be compared with hallelujah green pastures stormy weather cabin in the sky carmen jones or any other hollywood films but their great to watch because their early signs of black filmmaking and plus these films provide a glimpse into black life and black entertainment through a black person 's eyes
these films gave blacks a chance to play people from all walks of life be beautiful classy and elegant and not just be stereotypes or how whites felt blacks should be portrayed like in hollywood
most of the actors and actresses of these race films were n't the best but they were the only ones that could be afforded at the time micheaux and spencer williams could n't afford nina mae mckinney josephine baker ethel waters fredi washington paul robeson rex ingram and more of the bigger stars so micheaux and other black and white race filmmakers would use nightclub performers in their movies some were good some were n't great actors and actresses but i think micheaux and others knew most were n't good actors and actresses but they were used more as apart of an experiment than for true talent they just wanted their stories told and in return many black performers got to perform their true talents in the films
for some true actorsactresses race films were the only type of films they could get work especially if they did n't want to play hollywood stereotypes so i think you 'll be able to spot the true actorsactresses from the nightclub performers
these race films are very historic they could have been lost forever many are lost maybe race films are n't the greatest example of cinema but even hollywood films did n't start out great in the beginning
i think if the race film genre continued it would have better
if your looking for great acting most race films are n't the ones but if your looking for a real example of black entertainment and how blacks should have been portrayed in films than watch race films
there are some entertaining race films with a good acting cast moon over harlem body and soul paradise in harlem keep punching sunday sinners dark manhattan broken strings boy
what a girl mystery in swing miracle in harlem and sepia cinderella that not only has good entertainment but good acting
br br one of the best films i 've ever seen
robert duvall 's performance was excellent and outstanding
he did a wonderful job of making a character really come to life
his character was so convincing it made me almost think i were in the theater watching it live i give it 5 stars
robert duvall is a direct descendent of confederate general robert e lee according the imdbcom movie database
after seeing this film you may think duvall 's appearance is reincarnation at it 's best
one of my most favorite films
i wish the composer peter rodgers melnick had a cd or there was a soundtrack available
wonderful scenery and music and all tootruetolife especially for those of us that live in or have moved to the south
this is a real moment in time
life moves on slowly but strangers we do not remain
convicts is very much a third act sort of film
all the dialogue and character interaction that occurs within it comes out of the long winddown of a late southern day
and by extension the life of its main character soll br br this is the first collaboration of director peter masterson and writer horton foote
six years earlier the worked together on the trip to bountiful a film that seems almost actionpacked in comparison to this one
masterson is not necessarily a good director
in fact he 's just barely this side of adequate
the slow pace leaves a lot of room for cinematographer toyomichi kurita who infuses the film with just the right sense of fragile light warmthbr br because this is essentially a filmed play with little in the way of editing or directing prowess it all comes to the acting
as far as i'm concerned there 's no flaws here
robert duvall and james earl jones two of the best american actors create characters that are wholly real uninterested in anything besides living
lukas haas a young actor who i was familiar with from testament and witness plays a character very much like his other early roles
he is quiet withdrawn slightly scared and sad somehow
these are qualities that seem natural from himbr br perhaps a title like convicts is a disservice to this film
that title along with the opening scene seem to create an image of a far more highstrung western type picture
if slowpaced stage productions do n't interest you terribly you 'll want to pass on this one as well
otherwise this might be exactly the film you wish they made more oftenbr br enjoy
in today 's world of digital fabrication there is no computer than can replace the actor and writer
alas this type of character driven film is far too rare these days
duvall 's performance as well as james earl jones are faithful to their audience 's high expectations
i wonder if this movie was made for tv
it has a closeup personal quality to the narrative
it is an understatement to say that the performances are all outstanding
the only thing that keeps it from being a cinema masterpiece is the lack of a great cinematographer but pretty pictures are not everything
how can talent the likes of jones and duvall continue to produce such fine work in an age where actors pose for the digitizing
when i first saw this film on cable it instantly became one of my favorite movies
i'm a big fan of james earl jones and robert duvall
the movie paints an accurate picture of the south and the racist attitudes
most of the attitudes came from soll an old plantation owner who uses convicts for labor
soll is what makes the move his funny ramblings give us insights in to the way the south was back then
i suppose that if soll lived today he would be diagnosed with alzheimer 's disease
none the less his attitudes towards a little boy who comes to work for him and the convicts is complex
while he has racist views he 's grown to trust some of the convicts who are all black
the two convicts he trusts most are jackson and ben
the conversations between ben and soll are the best in the movie they have real chemistry
james earl jones and mel winkler both but in great performances as well as hassbr br this movie should have gotten more notoriety
however it 's on dvd and worth the moneybr br rayvyn
this is a very enjoyable film with excellent actors and actresses evoking a range of emotions
it contains some really excellent humour which the whole family can enjoy
you get to know the characters quickly and experience their ups and downs
and it ends very upbeat
what a delightful movie
the characters were not only lively but alive mirroring real every day life and strife within a family
each character brought a unique personality to the story that the audience could easily associate with someone they know within their own family or circle of close friendsbr br the story has a truetolife flow that the viewer can assimilate into and be part of the drama the laughter and tears as the plot of the movie develops
the script does a good job of capturing the common emotions actions and reactions of the characters to conflict opinion and resolvebr br not an epic but it is a very nice movie to watch with loved ones
plenty of knowing head nods and 'ahhh' moments to share and enjoy
i actually found this movie 'interesting' finally one worth my time to watch and rent
it is true some scenes were over the top on emotionalism shouting etc but what movie does n't stress its agenda genre or 'ax to grind'
almost none
what surprised me is that i read a review elsewhere done by a sfran reviewer on another review site but found his negative review instead a more accurate description of his own review of the movie not of the movie at all
anyone that watches this movie will realize that it is great to recommend to family and friends no car chases yea
being in an italian family myself i can fully relate to the environment portrayed on the screen
the movie has its tear jerking parts as well
it is what real life can be in such an environment
nice movie
i 've always knew anne desalvo was a great character actor now i know she is a great writerdirector also
i have been a fan since i first saw her in the movies perfect my favorite year dc cab and stardust memoriesbr br it 's so rare to see lee grant these days in anything
she has been missing from the screen for far too long
it 's also wonderful to see cloris leachman in something other than a sitcom
this is her best work since the last picture show
if you grew up in an italian american family you will love this movie
i was n't expecting a lot when i started watching this movie so i was pleasantly surprised when i fell in love with this movie
if you get the chance watch it
a wonderful movie
anyone growing up in an italian family will definitely see themselves in these characters
a good family movie with sadness humor and very good acting from all
you will enjoy this movie
we need more like it
it is a rare occasion when i want to see a movie again
the amati girls is such a movie
in old time movie theaters i would have stayed put for more showings
was this story autobiographical for the writerdirector
it has the aura of realitybr br the all star cast present their characters believably and with tenderness
who would not want mercedes ruehl as an older sister
i have loved her work since for roseannabr br with most movies one suspends belief because we know that it is the work of actors producers directors sound technicians etc
it was hard to suspend such belief in the amati girls
one feels such a part of this family
how i wanted to come to the defense of dolores when her family is stifling her emotional life
and wanted to cheer lee grant as she levels criticism at cloris leachman 's hair color
the humor throughout is not belly laugh humor but instead has a feelgood quality that satisfies far more than pratfalls and suchbr br the love that is portrayed in this cinema family is to be emulated and cherishedbr br it is no coincidence that the family name amati translated from the italian means 'the loved ones'
growing up in a multi racial neighborhood back in the 20 's and 30 's i grew up very close to most of the italian families living there
this move brought back so many pleasant memories
this is a movie most people would like who enjoy seeing more true to life movies
can scarcely imagine a better movie than thisbr br hey before you all go chick flick on me
i am a very large strong masculine macho man who happens to think this was one of the better movies of the last 20 years
br br the acting was superb and the story was marvelous
this is wonderful medicine for the heart and soul
the acting could not have been better nor the movie better cast
br br i have known for a good while that mercedes ruehl along with holly hunter joan plowright dame edith evans sissy spacek judi dench is among the greatest actresses ever to appear on film
and of course cloris leachman in my view may in fact exceed them all in the shear magnum of her talent and varied roles she has appeared in over the years at any rate this was an amazing cast
this film was like a book that you cannot lay down and when you have reached the last page wish for more still more
i cannot for the life of me understand why this film here on the imdb only rates a 39br br that rating here is utterly amazing to me
or perhaps not
perhaps in fact i do understand it ever so well and that is what makes me really sad
it makes me ever so sad that films like american beauty leaving las vegas sexy beast and fight club ratings skyrocket off the charts in popularity when they in fact at least in this viewers opinion should have received an r rating r that is for rubbish
hey ok i realize there are a lot of different stories in this world for a lot of different audiences but it is a sad commentary when this lovely powerful extraordinarily directed acted and written film seems to be over looked
br br it obviously was at the academy awards as well how sad
and how predictable
my summation is that if you want to see a powerful happy sad beautiful story
watch preferably own this film
i watched this on the movies with my girlfriend at the time and i can say that i did n't have the best time mainly because i did n't know about ned kelly or his storybr br but since this is a biopic it 's important to at least know what to expect from the characterbr br i do n't know if the manner the events are told are true or if it everything is fictional
but the way ned kelly is portrayed as a hero and a fighter for justice really makes me want to believe everything is true
i do n't think he 's portrayed as a redneck criminal or thief but that 's just my opinionbr br this is a solid westerntype movie for everybody 's tastes
heath ledger is great as always and the sexy naomi watts charms the screenbr br give this movie a chance if it airs on cable
otherwise i do n't think i could recommend it
fantastic movie
one to excite all 5 senses
is not a true historical report and not all information is to be taken as factual information
true hollywood conventions used like playing a list and very attractive actors as the 'heroes' such as naomi watts heath ledger and orlando bloom and unattractive actors play the drunken and corrupt victorian police force
this also instills a very unreliable love story into the mix between ned and julia cook to entice all the romantics females being especially susceptible
even from the first scene when ned saves the fat youth from drowning and his dad calls him sunshine and had a glint in his eye as he looked down at me his hand on me shoulder it is very romanticized and persuades viewers to side with ned kelly the underdog
besides do n't all aussies love an underdog
i'm tired of people judging films on their historical accuracy
it 's a movie people
the writers and directors are supposed to put their own spin into the story
there are a number of movies out there that are n't entirely accurate with the history braveheart wyatt earp gangs of new york geronimo an american legend the last of the mohicans all fantastic films that are mildly inaccurate historically
if you want to see a few great actors do what they do best then i suggest you see this film and do n't worry about the accuracy of the facts
just enjoy the quality of the film the storyline and one of the greatest actors of our time
i thought that this film was very well made heath leger was very convincing and his irish accent was flawless
orlando bloom and naomi watts were also really good and believable
how true it is to what really happened i have no idea but it did portray why people sometimes become what they do
maybe those in authority have always been corrupt and i did find it interesting that over 30000 signed a petition for ned kelly not to be hanged so maybe there was more truth in this film than at first thought
in many ways it reminded me of cold mountain which was another good historical film
all in all i would highly recommend this film and i am somewhat baffled why it did n't do better in the cinemas
definitely one of my favourite movies
the story is good acting is great all technicals are sharp and the script is cleverbr br heath ledger is terrific as edward ''ned'' kelly
he is gripping as the legendary outlaw and is supported well by geoffrey rush naomi watts and orlando bloom
all action sequences are on pointbr br the film is edgeofyour seat stuff right up to to the end
one of my favourite films from the late legend heath ledger who has been the highlight of every film he has starred in
and makes no mistake herebr br an excellent film all round
i did n't know what to expect from 'ned kelly' but absolutely loved it
it was dark dramatic and gripping
it also felt very authentic i felt that i had been transported back to the 1800 's
i 've never been much of a heath ledger fan having only seen him in teen type movies however he is quite compelling in this role
ledger plays ned kelly with dignity and intensity showing us how an highly spirited boy became australia 's most notorious killer
naomi watts is great in a supporting role as kelly 's society lover
highly recommended and that 's from an aussie
the only reason i wanted to see this was because of orlando bloom
simply put the movie was spectacularly average
it 's not bad but it 's really not very good
the editing is good the film is wellpaced
the direction is competent and assured
the story is plodding
the film is averagely acted by ledger bloom and the normally great watts and rush
the accents are impenetrable if you 're from the us so just sit back and enjoy the scenery
by the end of the film i was neither bored nor moved
some people have asked what happened to ned kelly at the end of the movie
i have to say i so did not care by that pointbr br really the only reason i can recommend this is that orlando bloom kind of sort of shows some hints of range so fangirls may find it worth the matinee price
other than that just do n't see it
it 's neither good enough nor bad enough to be entertaining
how could i possibly pass up the chance to see orlando bloom and heath ledger together
well i could n't and so i rented this mess of a moviebr br i had never heard of ned kelly and was surprised by what i found out about this young man 's legend
i was also surprised at how mediocre this movie was
perhaps the fact that it was very very late and at the end of a 4 hour movie marathon or maybe it was because it really is a little slow i found this story difficult to follow
not because the story is complicated but because it is slow
even with a slow story ledger and bloom managed to create interesting dimensional characters
br br though i flounder to recommend this as a must see it is a great story of australian history and the film does have some good actions sequences
br br 610 see it for historical value
i loves this moviebecause it showed that they were not killing for fun but to save the ones they loved
heath ledger and orlando bloom did a great job portraying ned and joe
it has a few quick inappropriate scenes but is all right other than that
the language is very mild and sometimes do n't even know it is there
this movie shows that just because they are outlaws does not mean that they are vicious killers
i hope that people will watch this movie and learn about important times in history like this one
there is one thing that fascinates me about this movie is that they got their inspiration for their armor from a book ned looked at
also that that is how people remember themfrom their armor
i hope that people will watch this movie and get interested as i have
'ned kelly' is a wonderfully made australian film honouring a true australian hero
we are taken into the world of ned his best friend joe byrne and the other members of the kelly gang as the film explains and perhaps justifies ned 's actionsbr br there is an exceptional cast present who all give stellar performances which brings the film to life
orlando bloom was fantastic as joe playing the role of quiet loyal ladiesman very well
i was swept up in the moment
for a moment i almost believed the gang would win the battle at glenrowan alas it was not to bebr br some aspects of the film are fictional and as an avid ned kelly fan was slightly disappointed by this
perhaps also the film could 've gone longer to cover more of the kelly gang 'sned 's life i felt not enough was coveredbr br regardless of a few flaws this is a moving film which stirs all sorts of emotions
i have seen the trailer for this movie several times over and i have to say that ned kelly looks like it is going to be a wonderful film
when i saw the trailer for the first time i could not take my eyes away from it
heath ledger sticks to what he knows and what works for him period pieces
not to mention orlando bloom who is seen for a split second looks fantastic
i think that this movie will be a hit and will be seen over and over again my many people
those who know who know the kelly legend are hoping that this film would be an accurate depiction of his life may be disappointed with the creative license taken with this film but if you look at it purely as a piece of entertainment it holds up pretty well
ledgers performance in the title role is quite solid taking the mantle of cinema 's best ned bob chitty a great footballer but a poor actor
some location shooting film in the area i live bacchus marsh outside melbourne as well as clunes ballarat
'had ned kelly been born later he probably would have won a victoria cross at gallipolli'
such was ned 's braverybr br in australia and especially country victoria the name ned kelly can be said and immediately recognised
in greta he is still a hero the life blood of the town of jerilderie depends on the tourism he created but in mansfield they still have n't forgotten that the three policeman that he 'murdered' were from therebr br many of the buildings he visited in his life are still standing
from the old melbourne gaol where he was hanged to the post office he held up in jerilderie
a cell he was once held in in greta is on display in benella and the site of ann jones' hotel the station and even the logs where he was captured in glenrowan can be visitedbr br evidence of all the events in the movie can be found all over victoria in police records and even in the sash that ned was awarded with for rescuing dick shelton from drowning
none of this is wrong and whats left out would further justify neds actions
the horse that ned 'stole' was actually stolen by wild wright
ned was already in prison when the horse was reported stolen so he could n't have stolen itbr br the jerilderie letter is more than what has been stated before
it is not self justification it is ned 's biography an outline of what he stood for and who he was protecting
so go ahead and read it watch the movie and then make up your mind about what ned stood for
the performances were superb the costumes delivered a unique feeling for the period and being a victorian living historian i was impressed with the accuracy of weaponry and attention to detailbr br i would n't say you need any knowledge of the kelly saga to stay with the flow of this movie but to comprehend the happenings and attitudes of the time you will require a bit of basic historical knowledge
do not expect as some rather silly people do any of the characters to have the auzzie accent as we know it it was at that time a country during infancybr br ok the story had some elements of fiction but these are required for a wider following of the film
gregor jordan said in the extra feature on the dvd that he wanted his movie to 'inspire an interest' and that is exactly what happened with me so this movie gets the thumbs up herebr br see it and you will not be sorry
the story of ned kelly has been enshrouded in myth and exaggeration for time out of hand and this film is no exception
what ensures ned kelly has a permanent place in history is the effort he went to in order to even the odds against the policemen hunting him
during several battles he marched out wearing plates of beaten iron off which the bullets available to police at the time would harmlessly bounce
indeed it is only because there were a few bright sparks among the victorian police who noticed he had n't plated up his legs that he was captured and hanged
the story has been told in schools and histories of australia for so long that some permutations of the story have ironically become boring
the more the stories try to portray kelly as some inhuman or superhuman monster the less people pay attentionbr br which is where this adaptation of our sunshine a novel about the kelly legend excels
rather than attempting to portray a ned kelly who is as unfeeling as the armour he wore the film quickly establishes him as a human being
indeed the reversal of the popular legend showing the corruption of the victorian police and the untenable situation of the colonists goes a long way to make this film stand out from the crowd
here ned kelly is simply a human being living in a time and place where in order to be convicted of murder one simply had to be the nearest person to the corpse when a policeman found it
no i am not making that up
about the only area where the film errs is by exaggerating the irish versus english mentality of the battles
while the kelly gang were distinctly irish australia has long been a place where peoples of wildly varied ethnicities have mixed together almost seamlessly br br heath ledger does an amazing job of impersonating australia 's most notorious outlaw
it is only because of the fame he has found in other films that the audience is aware they are watching ledger and not kelly himself
orlando bloom has finally found a role in which he does n't look completely lost without his bow and geoffrey rush 's appearance as the leader of the police contingent at glenrowan goes to show why he is one of the most revered actors in that desolate little island state
but it is naomi watts appearing as julia cook who gets a bit of a bum deal in this film
although the film basically implies that cook was essentially the woman in ned kelly 's life but you would not know that from the minimal screen time that she gets here
indeed a lot of the film 's hundred and ten minutes feels more freezedried than explorative
once the element of police corruption is established in fact the film rockets along so fast at times that it almost feels rushedbr br unfortunately most of the film 's strengths are not capitalised upon
rush barely gets more screen time than his name does in the opening and closing credits
ditto for watts and the rest of the cast come off a little like mannequins
i can only conclude that another fifteen or even thirty minutes of footage might have fixed this
but that leads to the other problem in that the lack of any depth or background to characters other than the titular hero leaves the events of the story with zero impact
one scene manages to do the speechmaking thing well but unfortunately it all becomes a collage of moments with no linking after a while
if one were to believe the impression that this film creates a matter of weeks even days passes between the time that ned kelly becomes a wanted man on the sayso of one corrupt policeman and the infamous shootout at glenrowan
annoyingly the trial and execution of ned kelly is not even depicted here simply referred to in subtitles before the credits rollbr br that said aside from some shaky camerawork at times ned kelly manages to depict some exciting shootouts and it has a good beginning
for that reason i rated it a seven out of ten
other critics have not been so kind so if you 're not impressed by shootouts with unusual elements then you might be better off looking elsewhere
especially if you want a more factual account of ned kelly 's life
i'm sure that not many people outside of australia have ever heard of the legend of ned kelly
i once saw a documentary about the man but that 's the only time i once saw or heard anything about him
and i guess that this might be the biggest problem this movie will have to face
noone knows anything about it and probably not many people will care about the subjectbr br the movie tells the story of ned kelly 's life
the irish immigrant has lived in northwest victoria all his life but has never been very welcome by the authorities
the police always accuses him of everything they can think of and they keep harassing his family
when kelly is fed up with the way everything goes he forms a gang with his brother and two other men
they start robbing banks and even hijack an entire town for 3 days
all this violence leads to a man hunt organized by the police and when they kill three policemen they are outlawed
finally they take over a pub in glenrowan where they have a party with all the visitors waiting for a train full of police to derail at a part of the track that they tore up
but the train is able to stop in time because someone warns them and what will follow is a battle on life and death between the police and the four gunmen br br it 's very hard to tell whether all of what is shown in the movie is true or false
i guess nobody really knows because there will always be two camps who will each tell their own truth one camp says he was a hero some kind of robin hood the others will say he was an ordinary criminal a murderer and a thief
i really could n't tell you which of them is right perhaps both are but what i can tell you is that the facts in the movie as well as is the documentary were about the samebr br this movie was a nice addition to the documentary i once saw and i really enjoyed the performances of all the actors
heath ledger orlando bloom naomi watts geoffrey rush are all actors who are pretty well known but even the lesser known actors show in this production that they all know what good acting should look like
i really enjoyed this movie and i give it a 7510
there are few films that leave me with the feeling that gregor jordan 's 'ned kelly' film did
initially i had heard only half hearted recommendations and decided to see it for myself
since then i have acquired both the video and soundtrack and have to say that after several viewings i am still very impressed with the underlying character of this film
it is also wonderful to see something australian
i appreciate its down to earth quality that if you ask me is a rarity as well as the absence of tackiness that takes away from so many films
this film proves that you do n't necessarily require fancy costumes and a glamorous set that absorbs how many millions of dollars to make a point
the cast was a bonus including a variety of well known and might i add good looking people who did well to slip into the role of such unique characters
it is interesting to note that much of the criticism regarding this film has been about who played what and how they only said so many lines
however if any criticism is due it should constructively focus on the fact that a number of basic elements of the original events were excluded
in reality these functioned to made it the hallmark that it is in australian history
for example on a closer examination it can be discovered that there was much much more to the relationship between joe byrne and aaron sheritt and that this was in fact responsible for many more of the final outcomes for the gang than were explored in the film
also overlooked was the fact that it was not only aaron sheritt 's efforts alone that provided the victorian police with their insights into the unfolding mystery
yes this is their interpretation of the story and it is understandable that true stories require sensationalism and at times the modification of the original plot to grab the viewers attention
i feel that in this case this is the only limitation
however i can accept that perhaps historical accuracy is only of significance to those who have a particular interest in the realistic events behind a situation
it certainly inspired me to look more closely
so watch it and decide for yourself
you might not like it at all thats your opinion and thats fine
maybe it is a film that appeals largely to an australian audience
for me i 'd call it a breath of fresh air
due to reading bad reviews and being told by friends that they could n't believe how bad it was i did n't go and see this film at the cinema
after watching it on dvd i have to say i regret that now
i'm not saying it is brilliant but i would venture to say that it is a good movie
i enjoyed itbr br people have skulls thicker than ned 's helmet if they go to see a movie like this and expect it to be a documentary
if you read up the actual history behind most movies based on historical figures there is usually a huge difference between the fact and the fictional portrayal
i do n't think ganghis kahn has ever once been portrayed even remotely close to historical fact
what kind of man ned kelly actually was is a matter of debate and quite passionate it seems
in spite of the efforts of governments and some historians ned kelly has become a legend
legends are stories and stories say as much about those who tell and listen to them as they do about the actual figure himself
ned kelly has become such a popular identity because he does represent that aspect of australian culture that does n't trust or accept authority
a society in which there is no dissent or challenge to authority is crazier and more dangerous than any bushrangerbr br so not expecting this to be an accurate recreation of the historical kelly gang i actually found it a surprisingly unencumbered and refreshing movie
it was sentimental and romantic but thankfully not anywhere as cheesy as it could have been for my fellow australians watch 'the lighthorseman' and you will see what i mean
perhaps the love affair business could have been forsaken for a bit more detail in other areas such as the shooting of the troopers
ironically i actually enjoyed the movie because of that because it would be those details that most of the focus on ned 's story would dwell
and they are the details of the story that are best discovered by reading the different viewpoints given by the various historiansbr br this movie was always going to have a hard time having make a compromise of appealing to a global movie market and the legend as it means to australians perhaps a little of ned 's spirit is in this movie because i think it rebelled against people 's expectations and unfortunately missed both targets
fortunately it made for an enjoyable quirk of a film
for me it was an unexpected kind of movie about ned and that is why i liked it
orlando bloom 's performance did a lot for the movie too he really added something
i think he would have enjoyed being the monster instead of the pretty elf for a changebr br when you consider some other movies that are far worse than this one your opinion of this movie should be reconsidered
send me this on dvd for christmas rather than croc dundee or the man from snowy river anytime
spoilers all too in real life as well as in the movies familiar story that happens to many young men who are put in a war zone with a gun or rifle in their hands
the case of young and innocent in never handling or firing a gun jimmy davis franchot tone has been repeated thousands of times over the centuries when men like jimmy davis are forced to take up arms for their countrybr br jimmy who at first wanted to be kicked out of the us army but was encouraged to stay by being belted in the mouth by his good friend fred p willis spencer tracy ended up on the front lines in france
with jimmy 's unit pinned down by a german machine gun nest he single handedly put it out of commission picking off some half dozen german soldiers from the safety of a nearby church steeple
it was when jimmy gunned down the last surviving german who raised his arms in surrender that an artillery shell hit the steeple seriously wounding himbr br recovering from his wounds at an army hospital jimmy fell in love with us army volunteer nurse rose duffy gladys george
rose was really in love with jimmy 's good friend the happy go lucky fred despite his obnoxious antics towards her
it 's when fred was lost during the fighting on the western front that rose thinking that he was killed fell in love and later married jimmy
when fred unexpectedly showed up in the french town where jimmy now fully recovered from his wounds was stationed at things got very sticky for both him and rose who had already accepted jimmy 's proposal of marriage to herbr br with wwi over and jimmy marrying rose left fred who 's still in love with her a bitter and resentful young man
it was almost by accident that fred ran into jimmy on the streets of new york city and discovered to his shock and surprise that he completely changed from the meek and nonviolent person that he knew before he was sent to war on the european western front
smug and sure of himself and his ability to shoot a gun jimmy had become a top mobster in new york city 's underworld
not only that but as fred later found out his wife rose had no idea what jimmy was really involved in with jimmy telling her that he works as a law abiding and inoffensive insurance adjusterbr br jimmy 's life of crime came full circle when rose after she found out about his secret life ratted him out to the police to prevent him from executing a valentine day like massacre with his gang members dressed as cops of his rival mobsters
while on trial jimmy came to his senses and admitted his guilt willing to face the music and then after his three year sentence is up get his life back together
br br spoiler alert hearing rumors from fellow convicts that rose and his best friend fred were having an affair behind his back jimmy broke out of prison ending up a fugitive from the law
it 's at fred 's circus where he works as both manger and barker that jimmy in seeing that rose as well as fred were true to him that he like at his trial had a sudden change of heart
but the thought of going back to prison with at least another ten years added on to his sentence was just too much for jimmy
it was then that jimmy decided to end it all by letting the police who by then tracked him down do the job that he himself did n't have the heart to do for him
sandwiched in between san francisco and captains courageous two of spencer tracy 's greatest parts is this very curious film about war and the effects it has on some people
they gave him a gun stars spencer tracy and franchot tone in the only film they ever made together and gladys george as the woman who loves them bothbr br tracy and tone are a couple of world war i draftees tone is a weak character who almost goes over the hill in boot camp but tracy stops him
tracy is still playing the lovable blowhard younger wallace beery type that mgm envisioned for him when they signed him away from fox
br br over at the front tone gets an opportunity and takes it when during a fight he manages to get to a church tower that peers down on a german machine gun nest
he 's learned to shoot by now and he does a sergeant york
but alvin c york was never changed by the war the way tone hasbr br wounded in the fight tone convalesces at a hospital with gladys george looking out for him
tracy goes awol himself to visit his pal and he and george get something going
later on when tracy is reported missing in action tone and george marry
tracy 's brokenhearted when he comes back and learns of the marriage but takes sit in stride
br br the rest of the film is dealing with tone applying the the wartime skills he 's learned to the gangster trade
he 's a hitman now and george does n't really know what he does for a living
i think you can figure the rest outbr br the part of the film that gave me some trouble is that i ca n't believe gladys george could n't figure it out
she 's a street smart girl her part is very much like the one she played in the roaring twenties opposite james cagneybr br speaking of the roaring twenties humphrey bogart 's character development there is similar to tone 's although he was not the central character of the movie
in fact there are elements of they gave him a gun that are to be found in taxi driver and in clint eastwood 's classic the unforgiven
br br the world war i battle sequences are very well staged by director woody van dyke
for some reason leonard maltin panned this film i think it 's a lot better than he gave it credit
for a danish movie i have to say that this is very good moviebr br it 's in a class of its own yet it has an international potentialbr br the movie has a big budget and is starring famous danish actors and a few newcomers who play very well
it can be watched by anyone who like adventures and a little bit of 'ghost' moviebr br do n't be afraid be thrilled
wow
a danish movie with this kind of content
i mean the actors the story the pictures the efx everything was where it should be
br br and a danish efx house producing those vfx wow
this is like the 2nd or 3rd time a danish fx has produces visual effects in that qualitybr br spoiler ahead the twist with the ghostly children in the submarine was quite good but generally i did not feel the big chill which i would expect from a ghostmovie
end of spoilerbr br but anyway this is a danish movie which i as a dane can be proud ofbr br the only bad about this is that it was n't a danish director but a swedish
i went to see this movie expecting a nice relaxing time in the theater with my younger sister
instead i had to really control myself in order to convince her that i was not scared
in many ways still a childrens story but with a screenplay that has a lot of potential
could have been one of the scariest movies if planned for another audience
spoilers spoilersbr br this movie the divers is really interesting
all i roughly knew about it was that it would involve nazi history underwater scenes and everybody would be speaking danish
but i decided to check it out for one reason the fact that the story evolves around a sunken wwii german submarine
i 've got a fetish for german subs especially wrecks that can be dived upon
so i was a bit sceptical about the danish part but reasoned that the sub could weigh up that part
knowing that nordic films are n't always that good and not sure of the budget size i was to say the least very scepticalbr br upon viewing i was surprisedbr br i had some thoughts on the actors being inadequate seeing how some are very young the two main actors in particular
this was not an issue they both perform very well
as do the other actors who mostly consist of people in their 50 's and beyond
this makes for some interesting interaction between young and old not often seen on the screen
not unique in anyway but somewhat rare
and it 's all goodbr br as for the danish language it is nearly impossible to understand
but this was no problem it had subtitlesbr br another issue was the submarine itself i suspected there would be interior shots as well as underwater exterior shots of the submarine
having decided their budget was slim i thought this could turn out adequate at the best and down right awful at it 's worst
again i was surprised the exterior scenes of the wreck are beautiful and the interior scenes are very realistic
having a fetish for german subs i knew what the sub should look like especially inside and was not let down
the team has done some serious research
it 's all goodbr br i suspect more people than myself will watch this movie just to see some sub wreck scenes so i feel i must issue a warning
the submarine in the movie is not an actual model that existed during the war
it 's a special purpose sub
but to give you a hint of what to expect it 's a crossing between a type vii type ix and a japanese transport sub similar to i52
it 's god a good design and makes a nice wreckbr br the setting is on a danish island or peninsula i ca n't remember
it 's summertime and two brothers travel to their grandfather to celebrate the coming of summer as they do every year
their grandfather is a mariner of sorts
the cinematography is quite nice a lot of pretty summer scenes at the island docks some newfound teenage love nice diving weather and a general feeling of perfect
once again it 's all goodbr br plotwise the island gets some visitors of the suspect kind a gathering of men hire one of the boats an old minesweeper and it 's crew
one of the visitors a man in his 50 's has the german eagle and swastika tattooed on his back
the island 's senior citizens all remember when a german uboat was sunk towards the end of world war ii and ever since then there have been rumors of nazi gold in the depths
the grandfather was one of the young men who searched for the sunken uboat shortly after german bodies started floating ashore back in 1945 no submarine was ever foundbr br what to expectbr br key elements are nazi experiments nazi history treasure hunting secrecy competition teen love conspiracy and a surprisebr br warning spoiler br br i had not expected some elements of the supernatural to appear in this movie and it caught me off guard
not being a big fan of supernatural events it nevertheless fitted well into the story and poses no problem
it 's not like from dusk til dawn where everybody turns into vampires towards the end
this is a bit more subtlebr br overall really good movie i gave it an 8 some due to the fact that it is n't a hollywood movie with unlimited resources
i later learned that it had a fair budget and that some of the actors were seasoned danish veterans
but even if this had been a hollywood production i would give it a 7 or 8 definately worth your while
yes a child 's story in a way but then again a mature tale
it has a lot of suspense and a grand aura of adventure which i found very appealing
and again the cinematography is really nicebr br medusa 2001br br
this was a strong poirotsuchet television mystery selection
the characters were vivid and wellacted
the plot and the main settinga student hostel were excellent
japp was nothing special but for me did not distract from story
one significant point many poirot watchers do n't recognize good acting or good characterization
i also think they are rather harsh in their judgments of some of the poirot mysteries
finally i have read few christie novelsnone in recent years and find it annoying that so many viewers are upset about changes from the novel
please viewers consider what is presented to you on film not what you think should be there
that said the poirot mysteries vary in quality but not as much as reviewers and raters would have you believe
with the singular exception of the five little pigs which was fabulous in plot character and theme the longer poirot films are neither that good or that bad
for the record i have seen all the longer poirotsuchet films
finally films without lemon hastings andor japp are neither good nor bad because of their absence
there presence however is either obtrusive or irrelevant with hastings
lemon is in the middle
hickory dickory dock was a good poirot mystery
i confess i have not read the book despite being an avid agatha christie fan
the adaptation is n't without its problems there were times when the humour and there were valiant attempts to get it right was a little overdone and the events leading up to the final solution were rather rushed
i also thought there were some slow moments so some of the mystery felt padded
however i loved how hickory dickory dock was filmed it had a very similar visual style to the brilliant abc murders and it really set the atmosphere what with the dark camera work and dark lighting
the darker moments were somewhat creepy this was helped by one of the most haunting music scores in a poirot adaptation maybe not as disturbing as the one in one two buckle my shoe which gave me nightmares
the plot is complex with all the essential ingredients though not as convoluted as buckle my shoeand in some way that is a good thing
the acting was very good david suchet is impeccable as poirot and phillip jackson and pauline moran do justice to their integral characters brilliantly
and the students had great personalities and well developed on the whole particularly damian lewis as leonard
all in all solid mystery but does n't rank along the best
7510 bethany cox
a series of random seemingly insignificant thefts at her sister 's boarding house has miss lemon quite agitated
a ring light bulbs a rucksack a lighter a stethoscope a shoe there seems to be no rhyme or reason to any of it
miss lemon asks her employer the great belgian detective hercule poirot to look into the matter
but what poirot sees is something far more sinister than miss lemon could have imagined
and poirot 's fears are confirmed when one of the students living in the boarding house if found murdered
it 's up to poirot to bring a killer to justicebr br hickory dickory dock is a solid but not spectacular entry in the long running poirot series
i appreciate how faithful the script is to agatha christie 's original story
i realize that certain liberties had to be taken but i appreciate the effort nonetheless
the major points of the mystery are all there the petty thefts the boarding house the students the ripped rucksack and of course poirot 's ability to see something sinister going on before it actually happens
with a few exceptions the cast of students is almost as i pictured them
damian lewis and jessica lloyd standout among the group
as mush as i always enjoy david suchet 's poirot i get a real kick out of the episodes with phillip jackson 's inspector japp and pauline moran 's miss lemon
this episode is a real treat as miss lemon gets more screen time than usual
finally i enjoyed the use of the ever present mouse as an observer of the activities in the hostel
it 's a fun little play on the hickory dickory dock titlebr br i realized while rewatching hickory dickory dock just what a tremendous influence agatha christie 's work was on the highly stylized italian mystery films or gialli of the 60s and 70s
take the murder of mrs nicoletis as an example
if you were to bump up the graphic nature of the scene you would have something straight out of an early 70s giallo
in fact the entire plot of hickory dickory dock could have been used in a giallo
it 's just convoluted and interesting enough to have worked
this story was never among my favourites in christie 's works so i was pleasantly surprised to quite enjoy this adaptation
the mouse motif was effective if a little overdone the bones of the story are there although more emphasis is placed on the 'crime in the past' subplot
the students were all pretty much as i imagined them although its a pity they were n't a more cosmopolitan bunch perhaps the revised thirties setting did n't allow for that
i thought some very daring risks were taken with the filming perhaps its because i 've not long reread the book but it seemed pretty obvious to me who the murderer was from their appearance in some reveal shots quite early onbr br humour was much more prevalent in these early poirots
sometimes it works but i found a lot of it rather heavy handed in this episode
altogether though a solid entry in the series though not one of the best
it all begins with a series of thefts of seemingly unrelated objects in a hostel for students on hickory road london
concerned for her sister who is the housekeeper there miss lemon asks hercule poirot to look into the matter
he agrees but soon the stakes get higher when a girl who had admitted that she was responsible for most of the thefts is found murderedbr br hickory dickory dock is a solid brain exercise without being as mindnumbingly complicated as one two buckle my shoe
murder theft and diamond smuggling are the crimes involved and the final twist that ties everything together is revealed only in the last 2 minutes
the characters are interesting particularly the psychology student colin mcnabb and the mysterious american girl sally finch inspector japp has his funny moments and miss lemon gets a more integral part to the story than usual
i loved dedee pfeiffer in cybil
have n't seen her for awhile and forgot how much i missed her
i thought she did a great job in this
the supporting cast was pretty good too
in some angles the daughter even looked like a young nicole kidman
the abductor was pretty creepy and the story generally had some good twists
the young boyfriend was a hottie
i thought the husband definitely had something to do with it for surebr br just got the lifetime movie network for christmas and am loving these movies
kept my interest and i 'll watch it again when they rerun it
can anyone else recommend any similar movies to this
you can post on the board or send me a private email if you want
thanks in advance
aboutagirly
i'm a fan of tv movies in general and this was one of the good ones
the cast performances throughout were pretty solid and there were twists i did n't see coming before each commercial
to me it was kind of like medium meets csibr br did anyone else think that in certain lights the daughter looked like a young nicole kidman
are they related in any way
i 'd definitely watch it agin or rent it if it ever comes to videobr br dedee was great
have n't seen in her in a lot of things and she did her job very convincinglybr br if you 're into to tv mystery movies check this one out if you have a chance
i have to say seventeen missing is much better than i expected
the perception i took from the previews was that it would be just humdrum but i was pleasantly surprised with this impressive mysterybr br dedee pfeiffer is emilie a mom who insists her daughter lori not attend a socalled graduation party one weeknight but lori ignores her mother 's wishes and takes off for the party anyway
when lori does not come home emilie knows something is wrong and she begins to have visions of her daughter and the events that led to her disappearancebr br seventeen missing is better than so many other tv movies of this type as it is not so predictable
pfeiffer is the reason to see this movie and most of it comes off as believable
this lmn original movie premiered last night

it 's all about mitzi
i loved her in this
and did n't she look fantastic
i love these lifetime sunday afternoon popcorn movies
this is like one of those nailbiters where they always go to commercial at the most annoying times
the richard character was completely creepy
i 've dated guys like that
well not totally like that lol
i wish zack had n't have gotten killed
he was a cutie and very easy on the eyes
i love these stalker type stories
it always makes me get up and make sure my doors are locked
my husband does n't usually like these types of movies but actually sat through the entire thing with me and actually enjoyed it
i ca n't wait to see what mitzi does next
loved it but still have nightmares over the hotel managerthe movie was presented well with the choice of actors carrying their roles to reality of the writing
many scenes gripped the imagination and created a nail biter
the progression of situations were cleverly writtenmaking me believe the story was headed one way only to find a new twist on what i thought might be the obvious
too bad there have to be commercialsi have told many friends to watch for further showings and i of course will view againi enjoyed the scenery of the film and felt this added to the plots and intrigue
husband and wife heated discussions were very realisticthe initial situation is a common one but the escalation into the story presented fortunately is noti want to thank all who were involved in this great entertainment film
thank you
looking forward to the next filmswhen
whidbey
it 's hard for me to criticize anything that mitzi kapture does
she just radiates beauty and grace on the screen and is a phenomenal actress
that notwithstanding yes the plot was predictable
i think perhaps if jill had slept with richard then it may have made him a little crazier than he already was which would have added more to the suspense
it would have also been nice to see jill and her husband find out about richard 's little problem with his exwife maybe a bit more back story
i was a little disappointed with the ending of the movie
i would have liked to have seen more closure with zack 's death and possibly closure with her husband
i do have to say though i will never be able to look at a flare gun and not picture her standing there
it was a very fitting end for richard
of course mitzi rocked
i am so looking forward to her future projects
i watch most movies that nick mancuso is in because frankly i love the guy even though as he ages he is typically cast as the baddie
it 's a fairly familiar movie in terms of plot but rick roberts is appealing as the imperfect husband martha macisaac is equally appealing as the daughter and mitzi kapture does a good job if that was her goal of being angry and sometimes pretty hard to like
nick has still got it in terms of being able to demonstrate both charm and psychosis
however too much of the plot takes place offscreen like motivation prior behaviors good times and bad times and things that seem apparent to the characters never quite make it to the audience
the final scene leaves everything to be desired in the but what about category and overall i ca n't say that i cared much about any of the characters
that being said it was what it was a reasonably entertaining way to spend the afternoon and i still like nick
this film starts out with a family who were all going in different directions and their teenage daughter martha macissac was very much in love with joe macleod
the mother is played by mitzi kapture who suddenly walks in on her daughter and zack making out and then all kinds of problems seem to surface
jill dunne has a husband who is always traveling or staying away from the home quite often
there are also big problems that occur when the family decides to go on a camping trip which their daughter olivia dislikes and just cannot adapt to sleeping outdoors and requires a tent to be kept out all the bugs
in many ways olivia does an outstanding performance as the teenage and nick mancuso gives a great supporting role as a hotel owner
this film will keep you guessing how it will end and you will enjoy a film filled with plenty of horror and terror
enjoy
when you actually find a video game to be scary or disturbing you know that the developers have done some very serious and hard work to make the whole thing work
undying used the unreal engine but had very little resemblance to that game when it came to actual gameplay
speaking of gameplay the pace is slowed down and the sheer difficulty in progressing through the very hard to kill enemies makes for a very unqiue gameplay experience
the production values are so high that you may even forget that it is a video game
the game itself is also packed with loads of secrets that you have to uncover using special vision
the level design in fantastic and the weapons as well as the enemies will really shock you
not being a fan of first person shooters i was very hesitant to play this game
after having played the demo however i was sold
undying really manages to pull you in the game and be part of the universe that your character is in
you have this green amuletcalled the gel'ziabar stone that has special powers and warns you of particular events or things to look at
with a special spell the scrye you can see certain things that otherwise would be invisible to you
walking in a hallway you suddenly hear the magical stone whisper lookwith the stone glowing at for example a painting
and then using the scrye spell you can see some weird and creepy stuff on the painting
let me tell you to witness something like that is scary as hell
people who expect to finish this game in a few hours can forget about that even with the use of cheats
this game relies on the character using wits and walking carefully around
because like in any horror movie your surroundings are usually pretty dark
and ghosts and monster appear at random when you do n't expect them and can kill you very quickly
there is this one scene where you want to enter a room where you are pushed back with such great force that it takes moments for you to realize what happened
this was a scene that could have come straight out of the horror classic evil dead
to experience something like this is a real accomplishment
there are a lot of elements that take undying to the level of the best classic horror movies ever produced
but sadly i have to report that there are some flaws
for one thing the universe you are playing in is huge
you start out in a big mansion with all sorts of hiddensecret rooms and even a hidden hell dimension called oneiros
that is all fine in the beginning
but with all the loading times and some difficult enemies in between that can become frustrating
and there is no map
the game demands you memorize your surroundings
so patience is required
also there are some jumping puzzles that you have to do otherwise you ca n't progress
i do n't mind jumping on platforms in third person adventures
but in first person mode that can be an annoying task
luckily you can save at anytime and anyplace
and trust me you will need it
overall undying is an extraordinary first person shooter that deserves to be played by any horror or game fan
i gotta say clive barker 's undying is by far the best horror game to have ever been made
i 've played resident evil silent hill and the evil dead and castlevania games but none of them have captured the pure glee with which this game tackles its horrific elements
barker is good at what he does which is attach the horror to our world and it shows as his hand is clearly everywhere in this game
heck even his voice is in the game as one of the main characters
full of lush visuals and enough atmosphere to shake a stick at undying is the game to beat in my books as the best horror title
i just wish that this had made it to a console system but alas poor pc sales nipped that one in the bud
i love the way that this game can make you literally jump out of your seat while you are playing it
the way that the screen jumps and flashes when you get hit its very realistic while at the same time you have to remember that its just a game and your not really there
the sound effects and audio are amazing
there are a lot of weapons and different spells to cast and you can even choose which spells to make stronger or not
you get this stone that can knock back enemies while you recover mana to blast your foes with even more magic
the best part is that the whole time you are playing it you are really jumpy and afraid of what might lurk around the next corner or what might jump out behind you
if you want to get the full experience try playing it with head phones on
undying is a very good game which brings some new elements on the tired genre of first person shoot em ups
it tells the story of patrick galloway an expert of the occult and a formidable fighter who is summoned by a friend to his estate in ireland to investigate some weird phainomena
the game is set in ireland after world war one so do n't expect to find weapons like chainguns or rocket launchersall the weapons in the game can be considered antiques but the real fun in the game are its spells and the system they operate onour hero is ambidexterous so he can use both his hands at the same time he casts spells with his right arm and uses his guns with the leftso you can shoot and cast spells at the same time which as you understand very fun and also unique to this game
the graphics are great and they can run very well on a medium power pc level design is also cool and atmospheric
mostly the game revolves around the covenant estate and the mansion but there are many other locations waiting to be discovered as you progress
thanks to the talent of clyve barker the game has an excelent storyline and plot and i said before a great and very spooky atmosphere the voice acting is also good but not excellent
but the game has two main flaws
first of all it is quite linear so when your mission says for example go to that room all the doors in the house will be locked apart from those that lead to the room of your mission this may save time but it restricts your liberty of explorationsecondly the fact all the weapons are antiques may not appeal to most fps players who are used to high tech weaponry
as far as difficulty is concerned the game is very well balanced
most of it is of medium difficulty but sometimes it gets more difficult but not frustratingly difficult
overall undying is a great game
definitely one of the best fps out there
this game was really great and quite a challenge
it has a great spooky story line and the graphics are also very good
i would recommend this game to all horror fans and is very gripping from start to finish
the only problem with this game is that i would have liked more weapons but thats just mebr br a truly great game for rpg and shoot'em'up fansbr br
this is undeniably the scariest game i 've ever played
it 's not the average shooteverythingthatmoves kind of fps but the acceptable gfx interesting weapons and magic great surround soundeffects and above all incredible atmosphere
i love the scrye which enables you at certain places in the games to see or hear events that happened there in the past
the only game i 've had to take regular breaks after a few minutes of playing just because of the intensity of the atmosphere
i'm a great horror fan escpecially of clive barker 's stories and movies and participating in a horror story like this makes me yearn for more games that emphasizes atmosphere and a more involving story
910
the days is a typical family drama with a little catch you must relate to the character 's emotions in every way possible in order for you to truly appreciate the showbr br br br the story obviously for all the people who has watched the show is the world of cooper day the middle child of the family
he records his days with his family and hopes to become a rich and famous writer one day because of his observations
his family includes a mother a father a perfect sister and a geniuslittlebrother
the first episode which is going to sound a bit stupid since john scott shepard has created this situation both the sister and mother gets pregnant
that 's the first situation the writer hits
then the father quits his job at the law firm
the youngest son gets a panic attack
the middle child gets in a fight with the sister 's boyfriend
this is all in a day 's workbr br br br i admire this show
i do n't know
it 's a bit crappy but i like it
first i thought the camerawork was a ripoff but then i got used it and started to like it
i liked the quiet conversations under a dark light
i liked the intimate feeling of the show
i liked the lowbudget style
i liked the acting
i admire the story
then i find myself wanting a second season of the days
i slowly became a fan of it as the 6episode airing on abc came to an end
it 's a really good show and it 's nothing like the oc
the two have nothing in common
so i hope fans will stop comparing thembr br and if you can relate to either abby jack natalie cooper or even nate you 'll like this show
a lot
the one and only season has just aired here in australia and i thought it was absolutely brilliant
i love it
all the story lines are so good
and its a much more realistic view on teen and family life today
yet it still kept strong family values of sticking together and being there for each other
their problems were real and it really drew you into the show
the show is basically about this family called 'the days' and their lives
the family consisted of abby day jack day natalie day cooper day and nathan day
each episodes a day of their life with coopers perspective on things throughout it
i loved cooper his insight through out the show was just great
he was by far my favorite character
it ended with so many things it could 've continued with i'm really sad another season was n't made
it was a great show i'm gonna miss it
i would just like to say that no matter how low budget the film is it needs to be shown throughout this world the point to these movies
we do n't read that much anymore instead people want to see movies
having this series out on dvd has made me want to read the whole series and want more
please make all 8 movies
please do n't change any of the characters either it ruins the effect
because i have grown to love the actors who have played the characters
please make all 8 movies
i want to see the message and watch the message that these books and now movies are here to portray
we do n't get that enough anymore
awesome job
i read many commits when it was in the theaters and they were all bad i think you have to be a certain type of person to enjoy these movies
if you are not a person that enjoyed the waltons or little house u will not understand nor enjoy these movies br br now about loves abiding joy i knew he was bad news from the start of the movie i wish it would have shown more of the end instead of letting you just think it
this movie has a lot to do with jeff it is 6 years later so you know he will be interested in girlsbr br i want to say that i have enjoyed all 4 movies so far was not crazy about the books cant wait until the next movie
the way clark talks will get you every time
i would love to see january jones do an appearance maybe a family reunion or something
we loved the movie
i am a mother to two little men
i love having a movie i can watch with them where men have integrity and character
moveis where money is not the most important thing
and family 's are forever and love means more then words
br br i do wish we saw more of the davis family
but over all i loved it left me with the same feeling the others did please do n't be over
we both wish actors would not changethe new actors were good replacement thobr br my 9 year old son loved this movie too
asked me to go buy them all
he is a movie critic so for him to say this tells me something
family should all see this move buy it for friends
help bring back a time of values
we will be reading the books now that we are hooked
really hope to see more
be blessed happy moving
this movie was so great
i am a teenager and i and my friends all love the series so it just goes to show that these movies draw attention to all age crowds
i recommend it to everyone
my favorite line in this movie is when logan bartholomew says rosy cheeks when he is talking about his baby daughter
he is such a great actor as well as erin cottrell
they pair up so well and have such a great chemistry
i really hope that they can work again together
they are such attractive people and are very good actors
i have finally found movies that are good to watch
lately it has been hard for me to find movies that are good and show good morals and christian values
but at the same time these movies are n't cheesy
i love all of the movies by michael landon jr and michael landon jr 's casting of dale midkiff as clark daviscould not of been any better
dale midkiff has the ways to pull off this characterbr br this movie kept me spellbound from start to finishbr br the death of missie willies baby girl with the timing of clarks visit was only gods timing
how they dealt with the death and how clark helped them do so was that of a fathers lovebr br although there are 3 movies before this one i feel you can see this movie and understand it easily
yet leave and want to see the previous 3 movies due to the history all the characters have behind thembr br michael landon jr is an excellent directorbr br i look forward to many more movies from him in the future
edmund burke said that all evil needs is for good me to do nothing
hollywood often gives us trash because not enough families go to see quality films
this movie was uplifting story of the loss and restoration of faith
it had no violence no lewdness and did not deserve a pg rating
the western scenery was filmed well and some of the vistas were simply breathtaking
actors were a bit young for their parts but otherwise believable and talented
music score was too loud and in some places drowned out the dialog completely
i'm seldom surprised by movie endings any more but i was pleasantly surprised by this one
sometimes the good guys do win and they win by honest efforts
we liked the movie and the message and would recommend it for the entire family
zombie chronicles is n't something to shout about it 's obvious not a award winning movie but it is a entertaining bmovie directed by brad sykes who directed camp blood which was another entertaining low budget flick
the acting is bad like most cheaply made movies but that 's what makes it more entertaining the zombie makeup is cool and effective especially with the budget the gore is also great and gross the film is sort of like a zombie version of tales from the crypt since we get two tales about zombie encounters in the woods the stories are fun and do leave you guessing especially the first tale
zombie chronicles is a lot better than some low budget zombie movies out there if you love low budget bmovies or cheaply made zombie flicks then check out zombie chronicles
okay first of all i got this movie as a christmas present so it was free
first this movie was meant to be in stereoscopic 3d
it is for the most part but whenever the main character is in her car the movie falls flat to 2d
what
it 's not that hard to film in a car
second the story is n't very good
there are a lot of things wrong with itbr br third why are they showing all of the deaths in the beginning of the film
it made the movie suck whenever some was going to get killed
watch it for a good laugh but do n't waste your time buying it
just download it or something for cheap
what could be more schlocky than the idea of private detectives getting involved with the women they 're supposed to be spying on
and most of the dialogue as written is perfectly banalbr br but the actors turn the dialog into something that makes sense
you can see real people behind the unreal lines
and the directing is wonderful
each scene does just what it has to and ends without dragging on too longbr br i showed this to several friends in the mid80s because i was perplexed at how such bad material could be made into such a good movie
the friends enjoyed it too
a critical and financial flop when first release the critics have turned around and stated that this film ison of the director 's best
a la ronde like feel to the film quickly develops as the guys from a detective agency persue fall in and out of love with some of the most quirky and beautiful women seen on film
much of the script was adlibbed or rewritten on the day of shooting which gives the film a breezy feel
ben gazzara is excellent as the head detective persuing audrey hepburn after dropping singer colleen camp and seeing cabdriver patti hansen on the side
john ritter ineptly follows dorothy stratten and immediately falls in love with her
blaine novak has a few girls he is chasing
this film has some great performances by a supurb cast
standouts are audrey hepburn
ben gazzara has never been better and colleen camp has one of her best roles as the manic country singer christy miller
she is a delight to watch as she fires off her lines in a ratatattat delivery
highly recommended
stars
bogdonovich 's unheralded classic is a film unlike just about any other
a film that has the feel of a fairy tale but has a solid grounding in reality due to its use of authentic manhattan locations and true geography perhaps the best location filming in nyc i 've ever seen
john ritter reminds us that with good directors he can be brilliant and the entire ensemble is a group you 'll wish truly existed so you could spend time with em
one of the few romantic comedies of the last 20 years that does n't seem to be a ripoff of something else this is the high point of bogdanovich 's fertile after success career when his best work was truly done saint jack at long last noises off
sublimity is the way we have to reach for the beauty
and sublimity is the stuff this film is made of
if not his best it 's my most loved of all bogdanovich moviesbr br this unique masterpiece remind us as most of the other films from the director what life is about love lost and hope and faith and charity
as the song from whom the films takes its title the film makes the impossible true and tries to make us aware that noone is able to judge anybody all this with the lightness of a comedy and the timing of a masterful direction
with a superb cast and a glorious soundtrack this movie full of selfconsciousness and compassion and far away from selfindulgence and emptiness deserves a better place on the history of american cinema than where it have been placed
it 's not long on style short on substance it is complex in its simplicity and beautiful absolutely beautiful
i am glad other people enjoyed this movie cause i know it does n't have the greatest reputation and it made no money at the box office
i thought it was terrific and there are several reasons why bogdanovich directs with the lightest of touches the cast is perfect and the big bad apple never looked better on film
you 've seen worse movies
new york has never looked so good
and neither has anyone in this movie
while the script is a bit lightweight you ca n't help but like this movie or any of the characters in it
you almost wish people like this really existed
the appeal of the actors are what really put it over go ahead and rent or buy this movie you 'll be glad you did
peter bogdonavich has made a handful of truly great films and they all laughed is one of his best
the cast could n't be better equipped to play this light but slightly bittersweet screwball comedy
interestingly enough the witty light touch bogdonavich so effortlessly employs gives the film a rather disarming emotional core
fresh and immediate the film starts with absolutely no explanation
there 's no soundtrack music to cue us
we meet the characters in action and as bogdonavich glides down the streets of new york the film unfolds effortlessly
robby muller 's camera captures it all with an understated simplicity that seems accidental but surely is n't
the cast is terrific
in every way a classic
with various bogdanoviches and gazzaras scattered throughout cast and crew they all laughed is very much a family affairif you add the fact that bgazzara and miss ahepburn had a brief but passionate affair in an earlier picture it has the air of almost a private movie made for the enjoyment of the participants and that the entertainment of a wider audience merely an ancillary considerationif this all smacks of smug in joke self gratification you will be pleased to hear that mr bogdanovich sails well clear of that particular hazard and delivers a sweet and rather innocent i love ny paean that is also an altar at which we can worship the ethereal beauty of the late miss hepburn
make no mistake this is her picturemr gazzara concedes it to her most self effacingly in all their scenes together
the plot a detective agency gets involved too personally in its clients' affairs is of minimal importanceit is the performance of the two leads that dominates the movie
mr bogdanovich 's triumph is in the way his camera seems to love his actorsfrom targets onwardsthere is a glow about every one of his films that only special artists can coax from an inanimate piece of optical equipmentmiss hepburn in particular benefits from this love
extra insights into his work can be obtained from reading the published collections of his essays on stars and directorsprincipally who the hell 's in it
recently remaindered in uk bookstores
the soundtrack to they all laughed varies from louis armstrong 's 1947 new york town hall concert to sinatra to country to latinas eclectic as the city it portrays
mr bs golden boy image was sure to tarnishfor such is the nature of the movie businessbut it is equally sure one day to be restoredand when that day comes they all laughed will be recognised for the fine work that it is
'they all laughed' is a superb peter bogdanovich that is finally getting the recognition it deserves and why
their are many reasons the fact that it 's set in new york which truly sets the tone the fantastic soundtrack the appealing star turns from ben gazzara and the late john ritter who is superb
and of course no classic is complete without audrey hepburn
the film is a light and breezy romantic comedy that is very much in the vein of screwball comedy from the thirties film is essentially about the odyssey detective agency which is run by gazzara who with his fellow detectives pot smoking and roller skating eccentric blaine novak and john ritter basically the gazzara falls for a rich tycoon magnate 's wife and ritter falls for beautiful dorothy stratten who sadly murdered infamously after production 'they all laughed is essential viewing for bogdanovich fans
this movie is perfect for all the romantics in the world
john ritter has never been better and has the best line in the movie
sam hits close to home is lovely to look at and so much fun to play along with
ben gazzara was an excellent cast and easy to fall in love with
i'm sure i 've met arthur in my travels somewhere
all around an excellent choice to pick up any evening
since the day i saw this film when it came out in 1981 it has been one of my top 3 favorites
the blurb i wrote for amazon is below and i'm just thrilled that it 's finally coming out on dvd on 101706 the film 's 25th anniversarybr br the last credit in this film explains its appeal thank you to the people of manhattan on whose island this was filmed
a charming and witty romantic comedy it is a love story written to new yorkers who can identify every location
one gets the impression that the entire ensemble cast clicked as well offscreen as they do on and this intimacy is clearly communicated
i laughed i cried it was better than cats
not only an ode to dorothy stratten it was also audrey hepburn 's last feature appearance and her inner beauty seeps from the screen
buy it make a big tub of popcorn and curl up with someone you love
i watched it some years ago
i remembered it as very mysterious situations and a mixture of melancholic things like the fate of dorothy and the personal future of bogdanovichbr br i turn to watch on my vhs copy and then i was reviewing it more and more
nowadays i am waiting for the dvd version at any price pleasebr br the country and easy listening music is very well chosen from the very first second a bit of blueish but also happybr br all the characters are great to me with funny situations great acting and a lot of dialogs that have turn this as a cult movie to me and a lot of people i met on the internet or cinema clubs
this may not be casualtybr br i think that the title is a hope about life
you have to be happy and laugh as much as possiblebr br i know that this may be a particular comment for the movie but the fact is that i like it very much i think that movie marked me and i will never forget it
screwball comedy about romantic mismatches in new york city
peter bogdanovich is obviously in love with all the women in his picturehe reveres themyet audrey hepburn is put a notch above the others because after all she 's the princess bogdanovich probably fell in love with at the movies 30 years prior
he shoots her in loving closeups gets right in the sheets between her and a wonderfully hardboiledsoftboiled ben gazzara and allows her room to sparkle throughout
the loveconnections made in the course of the film are fast and amusing though i did tire of john ritter 's tvstyled klutziness
colleen camp dorothy stratten and the grounded earthysensual patti hansen are all exciting to watch
but it 's really hepburn 's valentine and she absolutely glows
from
well i had seen they all laughed when it came out inbr br europe around 1982 and had kept a vague but dear souvenir of it
i 've just seen it again on tape almost twenty years after bogdanovich has a true heartfelt tenderness over his characters and a kind sympathy which is difficult not to feel also
excellent comedians and actors good lines all over and for everyone and pretty good editing too
i laughed and smiled all the time
just as we all do at times
go get it
they all laughed is one of those little movies i am always recommending to friends seeking something out of the ordinary
it is firmly rooted in the screwball romance traditions of the past but seems more contemporary
even the decidedly early 80s atmosphere does n't date it too much
bogdanovich wisely keeps the whole enterprise so light on its feet that reality never brings it crashing down to earth
but that said this sort of sweet little movie absolutely relies on the actors to keep it going and tal is blessed with a dream cast who understand the requirements of this sort of tale
it is a movie that would n't linger so long in the memory if it were n't for the little moments provided by the excellent cast colleen camp 's simultaneously shouting orders at john ritter and her dog blaine novak unleashing all that hair from under his hat and especially the moment dorothy stratten falls for john ritter and says how
weird
it 's such a piece of fluff one does n't want to lay too much on it for fear of crushing it but it is certainly does leave one with a light heart and a smile on one 's face
first of all this was not a three hour movie two hours ten minutes last time i checked commercials are n't actually part of a movie
perhaps though it should 've been a two parter for a total of about 3 hours
yeah would have gotten more in been able to explore some more emotion
overall though it was an interesting look into the lives of lucy and desi
i watch i love lucy from time to time and love it but never have i read or seen a biography never knew anything about their lives off the screen
because of this movie i do now but i'm not so sure that 's a good thing
everything here no one really needed to know
this was essentially a movie that did n't need to be made
but it was made and the reason is because lucy desi are still such huge stars and certain people in american society feel that the rest of society needs to know all about our tv and movie stars
that is definitely so not true and very very sadbr br anyway what was shown here in lucy was pretty good
two complaints the actress who played viv vance not great casting at all
and the switch from madeline zima to rachel york uhhh like lucy had plastic surgery and all of a sudden she 's a whole new person
that was n't too great
but the story went on and focused on the rocky relationship between lucy desi
no the kids were not shown very much at all and that was n't necessarily a drawback to this movie because like i said this focused mainly just on lucy desi
had there been more time had the story been more about lucy 's entire life then maybe the kids woulda been there more
but they were n't so we got to see the likes of gable lombard red skelton and buster keaton very briefly instead
wow that was one thing about this story that i thought was really cool his presence and influence in lucy 's life
really neat and it 's too bad that was n't explored more
oh well
what was explored was done well for the most part
honestly i do n't think i 'll ever watch this again and i do n't think this movie 'll be that memorable
for someone who digs i love lucy but is n't an enormous lucille ball fan this should be an interesting watch
my grade for this b
before i watched this tv movie i did not know much about one of my favorite actresses
after watching it i realized how sad lucille ball 's life really was
it had it 's great moments too but i did n't realize how sad it was
this movie was very good and told the story of the beloved lucille ball very well
i highly reccommend it
dramatic license some hate it though it is necessary in retelling any life story
in the case of lucy the main points of lucille ball 's teenage years early career and 20 year marriage to desi arnaz are all included albeit in a truncated and reworked waybr br the main emotional points of lucy 's life are made clear lucille 's struggle to find her niche as an actress finally blossoming into the brilliant comedienne who made the character lucy ricardo a legend her turbulent romantic and ultimately impossible marriage to desi arnaz lucy desi creating the first television empire and forever securing their place in history as tv 's most memorable sitcom couplebr br as lucille ball rachel york does a commendable job
do not expect to see quite the same miraculous transformation like the one judy davis made when playing judy garland but york makes ball strongwilled yet likable and is very funny in her own right
even though her comedictiming is different than lucy 's she is still believable
the film never goes into much detail about her perfectionistic behaviour on the set and her mistreatment of vivian vance during the early i love lucy years but watching york portray lucy rehearsing privately is a nice inclusionbr br daniel pino is thinner and less charismatic than the real desi was but he does have his own charm and does a mostly decent job with desi 's accent especially in the opening scene
madeline zima was decent if not overly memorable as the teenaged lucybr br vivian vance and william frawley were not featured much thankfully since rebecca hobbs and russell newman were not very convincing in the roles
not that they are n't good actors in their own right they just were not all that suited to the people they were playing
most of the actors were from austrailia and new zeland and the repressed accents are detectable at timesbr br although the main structure of the film sticks to historical fact there are many deviations some for seemingly inexplicable reasons
jess oppenheimer the head writer of lucy 's radio show my favourite husband which began in 1948 is depicted in this film as arriving on the scene to help with i love lucy in 1951 completely disregarding the fact that he was the main creator
this movie also depicts marc daniels as being the main i love lucy director for its entire run completely ignoring the fact that he was replaced by william asher after the first season
also though i figure this was due to budgetary constraints the ricardo 's are shown to live in the same apartment for their entire stay in new york when in reality they changed apartments in 1953 the kitchen set is slightly larger and offscale from the original as well
the connecticut home looks pretty close to the original except the right and left sides of the house have been condensed and restructured
br br there 's also desi talking about buying rko in 1953 during lucy 's redscare incident even though rko did not hit the market until 1957 these changes well could have been for dramatic license and the film does work at conveying the main facts but would it have hurt them to show a bit more respect to oppenheimer and asher two vital figures in i love lucy history
the biggest gaff comes in the i love lucy recreation scenes at least a few of them
it 's always risky recreating something that is captured on film and has been seen by billions of people but even more so when obvious changes are made
the scene with the giant bread loaf was truncated and anyone at all familiar with that episode would have noticed the differences right away
the we 're having a baby number was shortened as well but other than that it was practically dead on
by far the best was the grapestomping scene with rachel york really nailing lucy 's mannerisms
the producers made the wise decision not to attempt directly recreating the vitametavegamin and candy factory bits instead showing the actors rehearse them
these scenes proved effective because of that approachbr br the film 's main fault is that it makes the assumption the viewers already know a great deal about lucy 's life since much is skimmed over or omitted at all
overall though it gives a decent portrait of lucy desi 's marriage and the factual errors can be overlooked when the character development works effectively
i thought rachel york was fantastic as lucy
i have seen her in kiss me kate and victorvictoria as well and in each of these performances she has developed very different and very real characterizations
she is a chameleon who can play anythingbr br i am very surprised at how many negative reviews appear here regarding rachel 's performance in lucy
even some bonafide tv and entertainment critics seem to have missed the point of her portrayal
so many people have focused on the fact that rachel does n't really look like lucy
my response to that is so what
i was n't looking for a superficial impersonation of lucy
i wanted to know more about the real woman behind the clown
and rachel certainly gave us that in great depth
i also did n't want to see someone simply doing classic lucy routines
therefore i was very pleased with the decision by the producers and director to have rachel portray lucy in rehearsal for the most memorable of these skits vitameatavegamin and the candy factory
this approach i thought gave an innovative twist to sketches that so many of us know by heart
i also thought rachel was terrifically fresh and funny in these scenes
and she absolutely nailed the routines that were recreated the professor and the grape stomping in particular
there was one moment in the grape scene where the corner of rachel 's mouth had the exact little upturn that i remember lucy having
i could n't believe she was able to capture that and so naturallybr br i wonder if many of the folks who criticized the performance were expecting to see the lucille ball of i love lucy throughout the entire movie
after all those of us who came to know her only through tv would not have any idea what lucy was really like in her early movie years
i think rachel showed a natural progression in the character that was brilliant
she planted all the right seeds for us to see the clown just waiting to emerge given the right set of circumstances
lucy did n't fit the mold of the old studio system
in her frustrated attempts to become the stereotypical movie star of that era she kept repressing what would prove to be her ultimate giftsbr br i believe that rachel deftly captured the comedy drama wit sadness anger passion love ambition loyalty sexiness self absorption childishness and stoicism all rolled into one complex american icon
and she did it with an authenticity and freshness that was totally endearing
lucy was a star turn for rachel york
i hope it brings a flood of great roles her way in the future
i also hope it brings her an emmy
based on a true story this series is a gem within its kind

etc
and it really manages to captivate your attention for every minute
at times funny with a sarcastic and dark humor full of suspense and unexpected twists
xica da silva is definitely a must
i wish i could buy the whole series on dvd
i am black american and i loved this soap opera
i watched it dubbed in spanish on telemundo almost 57 years ago
the story was a true story about a black slave who 's love affair with a white commander led to her leadership and candid whimsical way of livingbr br a lot of us could learn a lot from xica
she took what she had nothing and saw her possibilities
many would argue that she sold herself out but she was trying to secure her future and that of her future childrenbr br it was such an excellent soap opera that i thought it would be released on dvd but it 's not being released
this soap opera was the best soap opera ever
we need for it to be released on dvd or broadcast on tv again
it 's playing on azteca america right now which is only available in mexico or in the us by paid cable
we need it released again to telemundo
this show is a great history story
it 's has everything from slaverythe way they were treated religion the ways jews were sent into hidingthe inquisition the belief in the orisha the african gods the way women were treatedincluding the daughters
even down to homosexuality
the way the characters are intertwined and that violante that character saddens me
she is so desperate to be loved that she destroys everyone around heri am so glad they decided to rerelease it to tv
again
although i would love to see the unedited version
xica has become my heroine
i look up to the way she uses her power to help all who seek it
i love all the characters and have found that they can relate to many people now in this century
i look forward to my xica every night
it would be great to dub it in english so the americans can love her too
i absolutely loved this soap
it has been one of my favorite
will highly recommend i just love brazilian soaps they deal with real life events
i'm really sad that the soap ended but i'm sure i 'll be able to find it somewhere
for those of you who have not seen it please see it
i loved the characters the plot and how things turned out in the end for the villains
the only thing i would have changed is the end for xica and her long life love
i ca n't wait to see it again and highly recommend it
xica has been by far the best soap i have ever seen
forget everything else go xica hope you all like it as well
xica da silva is one of the best brazilians opera soap ever
the a black slave 's story that becomes queen of a small villa when conquering the most powerful man 's of the area love in the colonial period of the brazil dominated by portugal that explored its diamonds
the largest xica enemy violante bride that it was changed by xica is a woman of big it influences the portugal king close to and does to take revenge of the slave of everything
very religious person she is a picture of the hypocritical society and religious of the time she dedicates its life the morality of the villa that was committed by xica that is a woman full of lusts that it faces the society of the time to preach and it helps the slaves of the area
the story also bill with forbidden loves sorceries and vampires and religious fervor
xica da silva does with that you do n't want to lose a i only surrender from beginning to end
telemundo should definitely consider making a dvd collection of the novela xica
i know tons of people including myself who would like to be able to purchase the novela xica
it is a very entertaining novela which is set in brazil
the costumes worn by the actors are beautiful and the town in which the novela takes place is beautiful
xica contains a lot of history of that time period
i wish telemundo would televise it again even if it was a 2 in the morning
i would highly recommend watching xica if it is ever shown again on telemundo
i 've emailed telemundo a million times already to show the novela again but my pleas have fallen on deaf ears
the only cautionary statement about xica is that it occasionally contains some harsh scenes therefore i would recommend that children under 14 do not watch xica
overall xica merits a 10 out of 10
this is without a doubt the greatest film ever made
it is nearly incomprehensible even with many repeated viewings in an attempt to figure out what exactly 's going on
the film was almost entirely improvised and includes random musical numbers commercials contests one enters by mail and a host of other innovations
besides what other movies have cameos by martin luther king jr
to decipher the film hunt down the director 's book entitled i was curious
it 'll all become clear
it 's a grand and bold experiment in improvised recursive filmmaking
a triumph
now if only someone would put out a version with the subtitles in a color other than white the white subtitles tend to wash out and become invisible
wonderful film that mixes documentary and fiction in a way that makes the spectator question what is the extent of truth in documentary films or is there such a thing as an objective documentary
i am curious was one of those big arthouse hits that first was a major sensation in sweden then a big scandalcausecelebre in the united states when the one print was held by customs and it went all the way to the supreme court
what 's potent in the picture today is not so much what might offend by way of what 's revealed in the sex or nudity the directoractor vilgot sjoman films the various scenes in such a way that there is an abundance of flesh and genitalia and the occasional graphic bit but it 's always moreso an intellectual expression than very lustlike but the daring of the attempt at a pure 'metafilm' while at the same time making a true statement on the state of affairs in sweden
who knew such things in a generally peaceful country could be so heatedup politically
at least that 's part of sjoman 's aim here
br br like a filmmaker such as dusan makavajev with some of his works like wr or to a slightly lesser extent bertolucci sjoman is out to mix politics and sex around in the midst of also making it a comment on embodying a character in a film
the two characters lena and borje have a hotcold relationship in the story of the film where lena is a curious socialistwannabe who demonstrates in the street for nonviolence and 'trains' sort of in a cabin in the woods to become a fully functioning one while at the same time maybe too curious about her car salesman boyfriend
and as this is going on which is by itself enough for one movie sjoman inserts himself and his crew from time to time as they are making this story on film then with this there 's a whole other dynamic as sjoman gives an actual performance not just a hey i'm the director playing the director bitbr br at first one might not get this structure and that i am curious is just a film where lena is a documentary interviewer asking subjects about their thoughts on class socialism spain and franco and once in a while we see lena 's father or bjore
but sjoman does something interesting the structure is so slippery as the viewer one has to stay on toes it 's impressive that so many years on a picture can surprise with not being afraid to mix dramatic narrative documentary filmwithinafilm and even a serious interview with martin luther king who also acts as a quasiguru for lena
it might not always be completely coherent analysis politically but it does n't feel cheating or even with much of a satirical agenda like in a godard picture the satire sjoman is after is akin to a godard but on a whole other wavelength
his anarchy is playful but not completely loaded with semantics or tricks that could put off the less initiated viewerbr br if i am curious stands up as an intellectual enterprise and a fullblown trip into exploring sex in a manner that was and is captivating for how much is shown and how comfortable it all seems to be for the actors it is n't entirely successful i think as an emotional experience
where bergman had it down to a t with making a purely emotional film with deconstruction tendencies sjoman is more apt at connecting with specific ideas while not actually directing always very well when it comes time to do big or subtle scenes with the actors
occasionally it works if only for the actors lena nyman and borje ahlstedt but some 40 years later its hard to completely connect with everything that happens in the innerfilm of lena and borje since sjoman fills it up with clichs and a heavyhanded narration from his starlet of sortsbr br and yet for whatever faults sjoman may have ironically considering he means it to be a comment on itself i am curious holds up beautifully as an artistic experiment in testing the waters of what could be done in swedish cinema or testing what could n't be and bending it for provocative and comedic usage
i 'd even go as far as to say it 's influential and has probably been copied or imitated in more ways than one due to it being such a cult phenomenon at its time and should be seen by anyone looking into getting into avantgarde or metafilmmaking
if it 's not quite as outstanding an artistic leap as wr or last tango it 's close behind
i do n't know how or why this film has a meager rating on imdb
this film accompanied by i am curious blue is a masterworkbr br the only thing that will let you down in this film is if you do n't like the process of film do n't like psychology or if you were expecting hardcore pornographic rammingbr br this is n't a film that you will want to watch to unwind it 's a film that you want to see like any other masterpiece with time attention and carebr br summaries may contain a spoiler or twobr br the main thing about this film is that it blends the whole film within a film thing but it does it in such a way that sometimes you forget that the fictions are n't realbr br the film is like many films in onebr br 1
a political documentary about the social system in sweden at the time
which in a lot of ways are still relevant to today
interviews done by a young woman named lenabr br 2
a narrative about a filmmaker vilgot sjoman making a film he deals with a relationship with his star in the film and how he should have never got involved with people he 's supposed to work withbr br 3
the film that vilgot is making
it 's about a young woman named lena who is young and very politically active she is making a documentary
she is also a coming of age and into her sexuality and the freedom of thatbr br the magnificence and sheer brilliance of i am curious yellowblue is how these three elements are cut together
in one moment you are watching an interview about politics and the next your watching what the interviewer is doing behind the scenes but does that so well that you sometimes forget that it is the narrativebr br another thing is the dynamic between yellow and blue which if you see one you must see the other
blue is not a sequel at all
i 'll try to explain it best i can because to my knowledge no other films have done it though it is a great techniquebr br think of yellow as a living thing actual events in 14 scenes
a complete talebr br think of blue as all the things in between the 14 scenes in yellow that you did n't see that is a complete tale on it 's ownbr br essentially they are parallel films the same story told in two different waysbr br it was n't until i saw the first 30 minutes of blue that i fully understood yellowbr br i hope this was helpful for people who are being discouraged by various influences because this film changed the way i looked at filmbr br thanks for your time
this movie is not porn it was not meant to be porn and unless my uncle runs for president of the world it should never be considered pornbr br now that that issue was sorted out i can say i thoroughly recommend this film as it 's issues are still widely available
it 's funny the acting is great and it raises serious questionsbr br i ca n't fully understand why this film was so mistreated probably this is why i plan to never visit the us
lena is the true pioneer of the modern riotgrrrl movement confusion curiosity and wit are her main attributes she is occasionally angry but are n't we all
this is truly an excellent film with a revolutionary message that should not be missed by any fan of french new wave or underground film
there are barely opening or closing creditswe are just dropped into the world of consumerist art revolution and youth
this film has little to do with documentary and is more interesting in playing with our ideas of advertising and its relationship to reality
lines of real and not real are crossed in ways familiar with films discussing documentary but this time we do it for the sake of consuming and marketing not for describing the real
i did n't expect to like this film as much as i did
i got it simply because i saw it on the list of top 25 most controversial films of all time
it did n't look particularly great
i was pleasantly surprised to find that it was one of the most cleverly composed films of recent memorybr br it 's about a twentyyearold woman wants to know everything
she stores every bit of information she collects in an enormous archive
she experiments with experience in sex political activism and human relationships
meanwhile film 's crew is shown making the film and we view their reactions to the story and each other
nudity explicit sex and controversial politics kept this film from being shown in the us while its seizure by customs was appealed
the film is a narrative yet it 's a documentary that shows us the behindthe scenes world of the filmmakers during the narrative the fourth wall being broken
this film is the most direct possible way of making a movie i have ever seen
the movie predominantly works as a time capsule of 1960s psychedelic goingson freedomfighting and sexual liberation
i like to think of it as much more than thatbr br i did n't think i would want to waste my time with the blue version of this movie but i actually really do
this film is a buried treasure
give it a try
this is a great film esp when compared with the sometimes wearisome earnestness of today 's politicallyminded filmmakers
a film that can so easily combine sex gender relations politics and art is a rarity these days
while the bouyant optimism of the 1960 's ca n't be regained i think we can at least learn a lesson from the film 's breezy energy and charm
i do n't know what those who label the film boring were watching there 's so much packed into it that it never remains the same film for more that 15 min at a time
jag r nyfiken yellow is a lot of fun
like at least one other reviewer i was on numerous occasions laughing out loud
yellow is energetic playful selfaware explorative
do n't expect bergman here
this movie is about a youth in the early to mid60s in sweden and about the issues read contradictions that the nation and the world were facing
at times yellow appears to be an earnest socialpolitical documentary with lena the main character and others interviewing both common people and politicians
at other times yellow seems to parody this kind of documentary
all the while yellow acts as a personal documentary exploring lena 's life her home life her loves her political views her view of herself
she is a complete person complex flawed contradictory happy sad curious
and placed over all of this is the wonderful additional dimension of the director sjman and his crew documenting themselves documenting lena
it is this that for me really gives yellow wings
not only do they suddenly appear at some very funny times and in some funny ways reminding the viewer that this is fiction and artifice but their presence is itself another layer of the film they are filming themselves filming themselves
i am reminded of a bjork music video with this same quality a music video about the making of a music video ad infinitum with each iteration getting weirder and more cartoonish
i think sjman may have had something similar in mind
while jag r nyfiken yellow may not be everyone 's cup of tea it is certainly intelligent witty refreshing ebullient and authentic
i 've read one comment which labeled this film trash and a wastebr br of time
i think this person got their political undies tugged a bitbr br too muchbr br i just rented the new criterion dvd 's of both yellow and bluebr br these filmsalthough hardly greathave at least become ofbr br historical interest as to the socalled radical studentbr br politicalsocial movementof the late '60sbr br i had n't seen either picture and from their notorious reputation ibr br was expecting some real porn there is frontalbr br nudity in the us but i was n't expecting the filmsbr br inyourface democratic socialist messagebr br though it tends to the simplistic i thought it occassionally madebr br its points well

fascinating i approached i am curious and it 's companion piece with great trepidation
i 'd read numerous reports on its widely touted controversy and explicit sex
what i got was n't this but a thoroughly thought provoking and engaging cinema experience unlike any other
i sincerely believe that the majority of the commenter who felt the film was lame' or boring' approached the film as if it were pornography
perhaps this is pornography assuming pornography is something intended to titillate the senses but it is intentionally unerotic
lena the protagonist throws her all into her performance giving it a realistic and humanity that is simply convincing and enduring
her breasts may be saggy her nipples unusually large her thighs fat and her face chubby
but by the end of the film the audience comes to identify with her and accept her faults as human
this touch gives her even more believability out necessity
had the director cast a briget bardot bombshell the effect would have been nullified
i cannot more highly recommend this thought provoking piece
be prepared to invest much thought in this deliberately paced film
the patient and unassuming viewer will be thoroughly rewarded in ways most other films could dream
of all the versions of the odyssey this in my opinion is the best of them all
almost true to the original storyline with some minor deviations and omissions eg
the absence of scylla charybdis and the fact that eumaeus the swineherd recognizes odysseus in disguise in his hut realistic acting and authentic scenery and costumes all contribute to make this a truly memorable masterpiecenot some hollywoodish swordandsandal bflick
notwithstanding the fact that the dialogue and subtitles are completely in italian if one is familiar with the storyline he can still make heads and tails of what is going on and what the actors are saying
at least i did and so much so that it has inspired me to study the italian language to better appreciate the movie even more
i'm italian and when i 've recently looked again this film i astonished for its beauty the first time i was 10 years old and i liked it but today i can appreciate it with adult mind and feelings
now i can understand it was a masterpiece of a special season of the italian cinema by that time gone
br br the hollywood epic films are good for fun
perhaps this 'odyssey' had no english version because is not enough funny not suitable for popcorn and coke audience
however suitable for homer pathos and existentialist reflectionsbr br in italy was recently released a very good dvd version integral with excellent colors
you can find it in some file sharing but it 's italian only and without subtitles
too bad also the dialogs and the voices of this film are remarkable
this movie of 370 minutes was aired by the italian public television during the early seventies
it tells you the myth attributed to homer of the journey home of odysseus after the troy war
it is an epic story about the ancient minoan and mycenaean civilizations told at list 500 years after those events toke place around 1100 bcbr br this is a 1969 movie so if you buy the dvd version you would find that the sound is just mono and there is no other language than italian even the close caption is in italian
pity
many people would enjoy this masterpiece if it had at list the english subtitles
but if this is not a problem for you than i would strongly recommend to watch this movie
although i have not seen this miniseries in over twenty years i can still remember how the balance between characterplot and tale of marvelous adventures succeeded
the use of special effects was restrained making a more poetic rather than literal telling of the story
the two versions i 've seen were dubbed but the actors appear to speak their own language not just italian so there is a synchronization problem
it does not spoil the story telling
among the cast irene pappas as penelope is the most recognizable to north americans
recommended to all followers of odysseus' ever returning
in all honesty this series is as much a classic as the original poem is to the world 's literature
far from being crassly exploitative it is a beautiful and respectful rendering of one of the western culture 's defining textsbr br i was moved by the plight of odysseus and his followers touched by the drama of the fall of troy intrigued by the way the gods played with the fate of mortals
br br it 's a pity it 's not available in dvd especially given the vastly inferior and cheesy adaptations of the odyssey that one can find in video stores
it 's very simple to qualify that movie a pure masterpiece
this opinion is formulated for the following reasons the performance of the actors they seem to be citizens of that epoch 1100 bc
they personalize perfectly the characters
a second reason is that the poetry expressed by homere in his poem is well given by the production
among others the narrations made by the chorus give a particular atmosphere that makes us party of the artistic rendition
third reason the reconstitution of the decor is absolutely perfect in mediterranean regions where the action of the poem occurred
and most of all the emotion is on the rendezvous
i repeat my appreciation a pure masterpiece
i 've been trying to find out about this series for ages
thank you imdb
i saw this as a child and have never quite been able to get it out of my mind
as a 6year old of course i was particularly struck by the episode of the cyclops which was absolutely chilling what i also remember though was the atmosphere which was unusual right from the beginning mysterious austere and extremely authentic
when i read the original many years later i experienced that same sensation
it 's a very hard thing to capture and probably impossible in hollywood
every 'odyssey' i 've seen since has been an enormous letdown
the characters in this series seemed genuine real people ancient greek people and not some hollywood stars in costumes
this is a real masterpiece
but why is it not better known
and why is n't it available on vhs or dvd
i would just love to have the chance to see this again
as it was already put the best version ever of homer 's epic
entirely shot in natural locations in the mediterranean
the sea and the sky are strikingly blue the islands green and untouched
the clothing is linen wool and fur the settings stony and bare everything is somewhat rugged and primitive a bit what you would find in cacoyannis or pasolini movies and it makes it all the more authentic
although the story is based on myths and widely goes into supernatural it gives us a good idea of what life in the 10th century bc might have been likebr br the rhythm is somewhat slow and austere but the whole is so beautiful that you quickly get into it
actually it is amazingly close to the original plot by homer if not to the text itself
ulysses does n't appear until the first hour the start being centered on his son looking after him
then he suddenly appears lost in a storm lands on the island of the pheacians where the royal family takes good care of him
his adventures are told in flashback as a narration to his hosts the terrifying cyclop the magic world of circe the underworld the sirens etc
he finally comes back to his homeland ithaca after 20 years and it all ends dramatically with the killing of the pretenders of his faithful spouse penelopebr br as a story the odyssey is an unparalleled metaphor of the struggles of a man 's life
the cast is brilliant and international here
irene papas gives us a typical greek tragedy style performance as penelope but most amazing is the albanian actor bekim fehmiu as ulysses
really good looking and totally convincing it seems the role was really made for him
strange that he was never offered roles of this dimension afterwards
also playing nausicaa is barbara bach later famous as the james bond girl in the spy who loved me and playing athena is michele breton who was otherwise noted in the strange movie called performance with mick jaggerbr br as it was done 35 years ago the series was actually quite an innovation for its time as the first big european coproduction for tv
i have seen this miniseries in 8 parts on french television as far back as 1974 i was a kid back then and although it was all in black and white it left a very vivid impression
all my life long i wondered if i would ever get a chance to see it again as it was never shown on french tv later onbr br i recently found a copy on dvd through internet
it is unfortunately only in italian with no subtitles although french and german versions existed back then
i never heard there was any english version of this film as it is widely unknown in the anglo saxon world and it 's quite a shame
if you ever get a chance to watch this you are not going to forget it everbr br there were not many versions of the odyssey before or after that
the one by camerini in 1955 starring kirk douglas is a classic swordandsandal like the 10 commandments but not as impressive and very short for such a complex story
the one in 1997 by konchalovsky is a meretricious hollywood movie based on special effects sometimes quite gory very poorly acted and grossly afar from homer 's story and atmosphere
documenting a documenter
that 's one way to describe keep the river on your right a modern cannibal tale
this film follows anthropologist tobias schneebaum who in his late 70s went on a journey back to the places he spent time as a participant field researcher over 40 years ago first to west papua and then peru
tobias is a fullbodied character a gay jewish artist anthropologist who eeks out a living on a cruise ship teaching gawking tourists about the cultures he has come to have a deep respect and understanding for
author of several books documenting his time with both the asmat people of west papua and the cannibalistic amazonians in peru tobias has been haunted by what happened in his time in these places and how intimate his connection and relationships had become
yet tobias' constant wonder and appreciation for the places he got to know is admirable and a real pleasure to watch
one can only hope to ever achieve and retain such humility themselvesbr br tobias makes a compelling subject for study as the experiences he faced in immersing himself in these two tribal societies has left him fundamentally changed
this film challenges the notions of morality and naturalness eg
nudity homosexuality cannibalism
when questioned as to why he engaged in some of the local practices that others would morally denounce his nonjudgmental nature asks why not
who is to say the way of other cultures is right or wrong
this little sleeper is a must watch for not only national geographic types but also those interested in the art of documentary making
this film shows what can be done shot on video
the editing provides a quiet revelation of tobias' life that leaves you watching in fascination
at times he despairs at being pushed by the film crew to make the emotional journey back especially considering his age and physical frailty
we can be but grateful that tobias allowed the tables to be turned on himself perhaps sympathising with the desire to understand humanity and one 's place in the world
the filmmakers provide some moments of critical balance presenting for example one anthropologist who believes that tobias predetermined his findings based on his personal interests
that said you ca n't decide when to stop being shocked and when to take this man home for a cuddle
move over river queen this is the best river ride i 've taken in a while
i saw this film at amsterdam 's international documentary film festival and was privileged to meet both the directors and tobias schneebaum all of whom are lively and outspoken new yorkers
the film 's title in amsterdam was keep the river on your right making the sensational aspect of cannibalism somewhat less prominent
equally important was the loving and gay relationship tobias schneebaum had with members of the groups he studied as an anthropologist
his reunion at nearly 80 years of age and inevitable leavetaking were very moving
i can only highly recommend this film to anyone looking for a moving story that is anything but pedestrian
i read schneebaum 's book when it was first published and was deeply moved by his ability to see through the many ways of otherness to a way of living a decent life
his subsequent books were not as powerful but showed his continuing quest
his description of his sexual relations with the men of the tribe was way ahead of its time in the early 60 's but his honesty and openness about it were welcome
this movie beautifully conveys both the quirkiness and generosity of the man but also provides a glimpse into the inevitable destruction of innocence that occurs when civilized men intrude on traditional societies
even so schneebaum himself has moved into a kind of higher innocence that suggests the possibility of saving humanity from its own destructiveness
i loved this movie
when i saw it on febuary 3rd i knew i had to buy it
it comes out to buy on july 24th
it has cool deaths scenes hot girls great cast good story good acting
great slasher film
the movies is about some serial killer killing off four girls
see this movies
i really enjoyed this thriller
i wanted to see it again as soon as it was over
the cast was excellent the plot was suspenseful and entertaining and it was just an overall enjoyable movie
i would rate this as one of the best thrillers i 've ever seen
the girls in it were really cute also especially denise richards
she was very ornery throughout the movie and gave her character some oomph
i gave it an 8 only because it had received such low votes this is definitely really about a 55 ummm it was kind of bloody had likeable shallow characters and it had some really hot babes in it
i like the eclectic killer because he did n't kill people the same way everytime that sometimes gets old
katherine heigl marley shelton denise richards david boreanaz
even before i knew what this film was about these names were enough to draw me in
gorgeous talented and popular these are performers to look out forbr br ok where do i start
we already know what the film is about
five beautiful girls being targeted by a 'romantic' serial slasher a guy they all turned down at the school dance 13 years ago
his trademarks include subtle deaththreats disguised as valentine cards maggotinfested chocolates and a bleeding nose
his weapon of choice well take a pick axe knife electric powerdrill bow and arrow hot iron etc
ok so basically it 's a horror movie with a nice twisted sense of sexualitybr br horror movies are n't supposed to be shakespeare but i'm not gonna go there
i love horror movies but not all of them
this one i adore
it 's up there with some of my other favorites
it 's funny sexy and scary
the killer 's mask is childishly creepy and seeing cupid firing a bow and arrow at a victim is really freaky
the acting is topnotch denise richards marley shelton and david boreanaz are a lot of fun
i really did wish to see much much more of katherine heigl
i am one of her biggest fans and would love to see her doing some leading work soon
jessica capshaw is a very capable actress and jessica cauffiel gets to do the ditzy blonde role she perfected in urban legend 2 the smaller parts were also good hedy buress was a hoot and that younger version of denise richards looked frightfully like herbr br highlights every death scene had a particular distinction to it
the creepiest being the opening scene in the morgue
the hottub scene while ludicrous was well done
and the audiovisual maze was sinister
the soundtrack is great with creepy music and some fine alternative tunesbr br lowpoint i felt as though the killer was n't featured enough we barely saw the mask and it was n't featured at all during the climax
i also thought the climax was really unfocused but fun nonethelessbr br the twist at the end was n't that big of a surprise but i'm really glad that the filmmakers decided to spare us that whole 'explaining killer' routinebr br i do n't like to tell people which movies they should see but if someone asked me to pick a horror movie that i thought was really worth seeing then valentine would be itbr br my rating 1010
another entry in the holiday horror category that fills the shelves of your local video store
the spoiler wronged nerdy teen taking revenge on the 'cool' kids who wronged him plot will of course be familiar to those who 've watched it before
and those who 've seen it before will probably watch it again those who are expecting ingmar bergman and will subsequently become indignant about their wasted time should just skip it
marilyn manson on the soundtrack and david boreanaz denise richards and katherine heigl as eye candygo with the flow and enjoy it
oh and i loved the creepy mask
the first hour or so of the movie was mostly boring to say the least
however it improved afterwards as the valentine party commenced
apart from the twist as to the identity of the killer in the very end the hot bath murder scene was one of the few relatively memorable aspects of this movie
the scene at the garden with kate was well shot and so was the very last scene
in those scenes there was some genuine suspense and thrills and the hot bath murder scene had a nasty edge to it
the earlier murders are frustratingly devoid of gore
what an awesome movie
it was very scary great acting wellwritten nice plot twists interesting characters very good direction and a surprise ending that will leave you with a smile on your face
this is one popcorn horror flick that may not be appealing to nonhorror fans but is still one of the best thrillers out there today
i highly recommend it to only fans ofbr br 1 the horror genrebr br orbr br 2 an actor or actress featured in itbr br out of starsbr br ps i am sick and tired of people comparing this and other modern horror movies with scream
ya know what they did n't want to be like scream
everyone 's like oh they copied scream
well if i am not mistaking scream also copied other movies too
in fact just about every horror movie copied an earlier one
scream however was a good film
but still stop comparing and enjoy it for what it isbr br go and rent this onebr br
valentine is now one of my favorite slasher films
the death scenes are elaborate and the most of the acting is good
marley shelton did great as the female lead
david boreanaz whom is the main reason i saw this movie had a pretty small role but he played it well
the exception to the list of good actors is denise richards
she was horrible in this
the only scene i was glad to see her in was spoiler her death scene
all in all it 's a good movie to watch
you should definitely watch this before you watch scream or i know again
these slasher pics are past their sell by date but this one is good funbr br the valentine cards themselves are witty and well thought outbr br the film has one peach of a line he 's no angel when he in fact is angel
watching buffy reruns will never be the samebr br the cast is a sizzling display of young talent but the story does not give them enough real depth
denise richards on the dvd extras seemed to think the girls on set bonded well together and this would give the feeling that you empathised with their characters
sorry but nobr br the direction is very good managing to show very little actual gore and relying on your imaginations implied threat
much can be said also for the similar manner in which miss richards and heigel do not remove their clothes br br essentially the main directorial plus lies within the borrowing of various other ideas from previous slasher flicks
psycho 's shower scene is tributed along with halloween 's masking
br br murdering someone hiding in a bodybag though is a pretty original one as far as i know
br br light viewing not very scary but a few good jump moments
if it was a choice between the hole and this though choose the hole
slasher movies have had their day and this is just another slasher
a very good slasher but nothing groundbreaking
call me stupid but i absolutely loved the 2001 horror movie valentine
it was so wellmade wellwritten wellacted welldirected etc
everything about it was wonderful
there were parts that were relatively routine very funny completely horrifying and creepy and just plain heartbreaking
i think the entire cast did a great job especially the three leads david boreanaz denise richards and marley sheltonbr br i am very sick of people calling this movie another scream clone
this movie is in no way a scream clone
in fact this film runs rings around scream
it actually makes sense
scream was also not the only movie to feature a masked killer in it
excuse me but it looks like scream was also a clone too
i also think that the novelty of the cupidmasked killer is brilliant
it 's so strange to see a sweet cupid face doing all of these horrible things
another novelty makes way for a fantastic ending
the ending gives me chills every time i see it
so even if you did n't like it the first time watch valentine again and give it another chancebr br ps keep an eye out for my new website
coming soon
i wanted to see valentine ever since i saw that denise richards and marley shelton were in it because they had played in some of my favorite movies ever
when i watched valentine i was amazed at how great the story line actually was
it kills me to see that it has a low rating because it was not horrible at all
the actors and actresses played the parts wonderfully and the way it ended was so brilliant and cunning
some scenes were a little unbelievable and or poor and i admit at a few minor parts it got just a small bit boring but overall it was nonstop entertaining and suspenseful
it had a mindtwisting story line which made you guess the whole way through and it does n't deserve all the crap it gets
i recommend this movie to watch anytime but especially on valentine 's day because it 's sure to give you a ton of chills
oh and do n't even pay attention to the trailer or rating please do n't
it 's a colorful slasher movie
that 's about itbr br it has the mystery element that scream made so popular in slasher movies but i never care for such things
figuring out who 's the bad guy is not that interesting considering the clues are all misleading anywaybr br the death scenes were inventive and gorey bringing back memories of 80 's horror movies like friday the 13th
br br another nice thing about this movie is that it 's hard to pinpoint the surviving girl unlike in scream and ikwydls where it was obvious
br br people who do n't like slasher movies wo n't like this movie
as simple as that
i truly enjoyed it and i plan to watch it again while waiting for more of the same
br br mb
i just saw valentine and i have to say that it was the best slasher movie that i 've seen in years
unlike the recent trend of 90 's horror flicks this movie is more concerned with being eerie than it is with being selfmocking
for those out there that hated scream there is not one reference to the horror rules in this movie
br br this is the perfect blend of 80 's and 90 's horror
you get the style cinematography and good acting of 90 's films and the stalkingslasher madness of an 80 's flick
i guess the year 2001 is going to finally give horror fans the kind of movies they were longing for
this is definitely a move in the right directionbr br denise richards stands out here as a fun character
you can tell she liked her role and that makes her stand out
i loved her in this movie
i'm not a follower of a certain movie genre
i classify movies only as industrial or nonindustrial
valentine is the second industrial movie of the director jamie blanks after his urban legends
unlike urban legends the screenplay and the story line is very weak
yet again unlike urban legends the basic elements of the movie is so dashing and iconic and that is what makes valentine the best
br br as the first basic and iconic element the growing hatred of the serial killer is so downtoearth
since his secondary school years he has grown up with his wounds he had accumulated in his soul against his classmate girlfriends who have made fun of him
when you concentrate enough on this first element while watching the movie you will come to see this point of view of humanism noone is entirely good or evil
in fact somebody known as evil can be secretly kind hearted
just because the story line and the direction is very weak we are not as satisfied as we deserved
br br the second iconic element is of course the magnificent togetherness of the late 90s' super starlets my favourite is jessica cauffiel who is killed within the coolest way to be killed
an arrow shot from a bow broaches her tummy and stays stuck in while she was playing hideandseek with her blind date never able to met with
katherine heigl is the first starlet getting killed in a biology laboratory while trying to hide under human body models lying on the surgical operation tables
denise richards is killed third while she just found a valentines' day gift for her at a whirlpool bath
jessica capshaw is killed last in a confidential and unseen way then she is calumniated to be as the serial killer
marley shelton is the unluckiest one with a vicissitude of fortune that she is going to be killed within the most confidential way that we will never know 'cause the movie is coming to an end before she is getting killed
finally benita ha is the luckiest one since she was not a classmate of the serial killer david boreanazbr br the third and the last iconic element is the soundtrack from the blind date labyrinth scene the valentines' day celebration at dorothy 's house scenes and ultimately the killing themes
everybody has loved the soundtrack as far as i know
hard rock never suits better within a serial killermystery movie
a group of modelcaliber san francisco women who have been friends since elementary school are suddenly being threatened and attacked by someone sending them bizarre valentine 's day cards
who is the killer and why is the killer after them
br br my rating will often change on subsequent viewings of a filmsometimes slightly up sometimes slightly down
however i ca n't remember another film where my rating has changed as drastically as it has for valentine
the first time i watched it upon its theatrical release i thought it was pretty awfuli gave it a 4 out of 10 the equivalent of an f letter grade
watching it for a second time last night i ca n't remember what the heck i did n't like about it
i can only assume that maybe i was really in the wrong mood to watch it or maybe i just did n't get it
in any event i loved it this time giving it a 9 out of 10 or an abr br it might sound ridiculous saying i did n't get a film like this but there is something to get
valentine is almost a comedyhorror
director jamie blanks who was also responsible for 1998 's urban legend takes the stereotypical teen horror formula that became so popular in the late 1990s in the wake of scream and pushes most of the elements up a notch making valentine intentionally cheesycampy almost to the point of absurdity
on top of that he gives us a film imbued with humorous commentary on romantic relationships
the humor is unusual in that it has the same exaggeratedly campy tone as the teen horror aspects
most of the situations in the film and the modus operandi of the villain humorous or not are tied in to the valentine 's day themebr br many viewers will likely subtract points from the film for its various clichrooted but implausible scenarios and plot developments
however in light of the above the film is intentionally clichd implausible and ludicrous
it 's as if blanks is attempting to transcend the typical teen slasher by mockingspoofing the conventions of the genre while also satirizing eros
that 's the attraction to the irony of basing a horror film on valentine 's day
it 's an incongruity that is cleverly woven throughout the film and that is itself at the heart of the slasher genre making it prime fodder for valentine 's extravagant lampooning
scream had a similar aim with its horror material but the twist there was that the film was selfaware
valentine 's day is intentionally not selfaware the viewer has to rely on contextual clues for satire
lest some think i'm reading too much into the film it 's worthwhile to note that blanks said in interviews that he did n't want to just do another slasher film after urban legend and producer dylan sellers said he wanted to do something more adultbr br other viewers may dislike the fact that valentine 's day differs so much from its putative source material the novel of the same name by tom savage
the novel 's characters setting and plot are very different from the film
sellers has said while it was a fine book i did n't think it was the right story for a film
so instead the novel which is much dryer and more serious in tone was used as a launching pad a motif to create variations on for a horrorthriller story centered on valentine 's day
while those facts wo n't help purists familiar with the book like the film it 's helpful to understand why the film has its divergent plot and attitude
it 's probably better to look at the film as an independent entity with a similar themebr br blanks' direction is impeccable visually
valentine 's day has a lush look throughout with complex deep colors interesting sets and good staging
blanks is admirable for keeping his villain and attack scenes not too dark with clearly conveyed action
he also directs his actors with aplomb catalyzing often slyly humorous performances
david boreanaz as adam carr is involved in many of the funniest momentsbr br while valentine 's day is no masterpiece it 's a very good horrorthriller film that seems strongly prone to misconceptions
if you watch it expecting something more tongueincheek you may find yourself appreciating it a lot more
i like many horror fans have been force fed the same banal big budget hollywood remakes and mtv high school slasher tripe for the last 20 years
here at last is an original horror genre movie that ticks all the right boxesbr br you want a hot lead actress you want vampires you want cool weapons you want cool vehicles and you want blood lots of it by the bucket load you got itbr br with excellent fight choreography and a supporting role from the hammer horror scream queen herself stephanie beacham this really is fantastic stuffbr br despite it 's low budget by opting to use 35 mm stock and adding quality cg effects to the mix director james eaves has created something that feels much biggerbr br a must for old school horror fans
turned out to be a classy production with what must have been a low budget
the variety of characters is amazing from axewielding dwarfs to 7ft ghouls
i enjoyed the relationship between the leads not overly sentimental but romantic enough to keep the interest going
i also enjoyed the mix of humour which meant it did n't get too dark nor too spoofy
it was a great step up from eaves' other efforts hellbreeder and sanitarium in terms of storyline and production
they have a great website which is worth checking out
ca n't wait for bane if the level of improvement continues it should be fantastic
the film is hugely enjoyable with a great cast and excellent direction by james eves
the movie is entertaining with a very charismatic performance from stephanie beecham and everyone is perfectly cast
james eves has a good eye for casting and directs like a conductor knowing exactly when to crank up the action fall and then rise to a climax
he does this with an element of humour plenty of twists thrills and blood
this is a return of the old vampire movie with loads of gore blood and screams
the movie works at a great speed and the characters take you on a terrific adventurebut what makes it work is that the film does n't take itself too seriously with plenty of tongue in cheek actiongreat
the color purple is about the struggles of life and the love that helps those people strongly affected by the struggles of life
every character had an element of the color purple in them
the movie touches on love lost hope hate and triumph
whether it be celie having lived through hell and losing her sister and shug coming into her life to show her love again albert not being man righting his wrong toward celie shug shunned by her father and confesses to him in the end sofia and her stubborness good and bad and even nettie they had their emptiness and hardship through the film but was overcome in the end and that 's the sign of a good movie
good job to all the cast and crew
i ca n't believe i am just now seeing this film i think perhaps i thought it was another movie about slaves being mistreated and i avoided roots for the same reason just as i have yet to see schindler 's list i do n't want to be entertained by other peoples' pain not matter how authentic or informative it is supposed to bebr br so i guess the main thing i noticed about the color purple was that it was not about black people being mistreated by whites
the black people were perfectly capable of raping their own daughters or giving them away to be treated as slaves by their husbands
it was painful to watch but everyone redeemed himself in the end and the acting was phenomenal
i could n't believe the character oprah played at the age of 35
and i adore whoopi to start with she was amazing
i'm so glad i was feeling lousy yesterday afternoon and showtime was running the color purple
11 oscar nominations and zero win
am yet to understand why its not like the actors in the movie did any better thereafter that you can make it by giving them awards for trivial roles like it was done with halle berry and denzel washington whoopi oprah margaret avery danny glover etc were all amazing i am curious to get scripts of the discussions at the oscars that year it should go into the shouldawouldacoulda category for the judges br br its an amazing book but true to alice walker 's style of writing she has a way of seeming like she is exaggerating her characters so i am so glad that they screen adaptation took a few things out
br br the cinematography was amazing the african scenes live much to be desired the african part in the book is supposed to be set in liberia somewhere in west africa but oh no
steven spielberg thinks the world is so dumb that they cant think of africa outside of the safaris so yes there had to be a complimentary zebra and wildlife scene when we all know there are none west africa and most of all why get the people to speak swahili who in west africa speaks swahili
i just had to get that out of the way br br but as a story amazing filmmaking out of this world classic yes
br br i own it and i watch it when my soul needs some rejuvenation
like i said at the top four stars just are n't enough
it 's one of the best films i 've ever seen in my almost 17 years of life
for the people that do n't really like it or understand it you must not have a real appreciation for art or you might have a short attention spanbr br even if i have n't seen all his films yet i 'd have to say that this is spielberg at his peak
it 's pretty sad to see that movies as great as the color purple do n't come along too often 'cause i think all of us are in desperate need of firstclass motion picture entertainment in these hard timesbr br movies like this are more than just movies they 're pieces of art that need to be appreciated morebr br the idea that it was nominated for 11 oscars and did n't get one trophy is a sign of how blind and stupid hollywood can be sometimes
spielberg was n't even nominated for best director
it should have swept the oscars that yearbr br the film clearly shows you how unfair life is for some peoplebr br if only movies were still this good
in the year 1985 steven spielberg directed an emotionally strong and unforgettable story of a young africanamerican girl celie whose life is followed through rough times
the story begins from the year 1909 when celie is only 14 years old
she has given birth two children for her father
celie has a younger sister nettie with whom she is inseparable
a widower lays his eyes on nettie but their father gives celie to him
it is the beginning of an era of horrible abuse and constant controlling
women are inferior of men and especially being an africanamerican woman their rights are less than a zero
celie 's story is a true survival storybr br the color purple is a masterpiece and underestimated film of spielberg
he should make more drama which the color purple and schindler 's list are good notionbr br the cast is amazing
whoopi goldberg is known better as a ravingly funny comedienne but the introducing role as celie is a remarkable word that she really can pull of heavy drama
danny glover was surprisingly nasty mister
i have never seen him in a such an evil role
the talkshow icon oprah winfrey is brilliant as a strongwilled sofiabr br warning
prepare to have a number of tissues with you when watching this film
you can really connect to the story of the strong sisterhood
especially if you have as close relationship with your siblings like i have with my sisterbr br big applauds to mr spielberg
this movie is about development
people growing and people fading people surprising and people disappointing
it has it all and more
there is hope frustration injustice justice love and hate
it is truly a classic drama that has fantastic performances from the whole cast but especially whoopi goldberg in her debut rolebr br this movie made me feel very human and proud of it and i suggest that this movie should be mandatory each saturday in all prisons in the world it touches your compassion
rating 10 of 10br br ps i admit it i shed a tear of joy during the final scene
steven speilberg 's adaptation of alice walkers popular novel is not without its share of controversy
when first released members of the black community criticised its treatment of black men while others questioned why a white man was directing this film about black womenbr br this is the story of a young black woman named celie growing up in rural america after the turn of the century
she has two children by her abusive father which are snatched from her arms at birth
her only solace in her miserable life comes from her sisterbr br celie is married off to an abusive husband
the husband is humiliated by the sister and so she is quickly removed from celie 's lifebr br the story is often heartbreaking as celie keeps up hope that she may one day be reunited with her sister and with her children
throughout her life she meets an assortment of characters including sophia a tough as nails wife to her step son and shug a loud and luscious saloon singer who teaches her a thing or two about lovebr br speilberg 's direction is all over this picture which offers brilliant cinematography and some stellar performances
i dare you to watch this film and not be moved
the film the color purple manages to capture the essence of what is a complicated story
while it tends to minimise the lesbian aspects as well as the african story both of which were so vivid in the book the movie remains true to its themes allowing the voice of alice walker to shine throughbr br i could n't begin to respond to the controversy that surrounded this film
suffice it to say however this is one of the few films that i can watch again and again and which has left an indelible mark on mebr br
this is an excellent film with an extraordinary cast and acting
i was very disappointed with the academy awards when this did n't get the oscar for best film and for best actress it certainly deserved it
in any case take a look at it
i am sure you will enjoy it very much
this movie is so wonderful it 's hard to find words to describe it
this is the only time i ca n't decide which was better the book or the moviebr br whoopi goldberg is awesome and oprah winfrey such a good actress she could be funny happy and miserable all at the same time
all together the movie was well directed by steven speilberg and should not be passed up
910
the color purple is truly amazing
there is none like it and i do n't think there ever will be
it 's a roller coster of emotion and pain that the viewer takes on
the actors are flawless and the directing is superb
i absolutely loved it
a movie has never made me so happy
it is beautiful that 's the best way to explain it
the color purple is a masterpiece
it displays the amazing acting abilities of whoopi goldberg oprah winfrey and danny glover
not only is steven spielberg the most incredible director of all time but his versatility shines through in this film
if you ever want to see what a movie can do watch this
it 's a beautiful portrayal of one of the most moving stories of all time
absolutely one of my favorite movies of all time
i have seen it at least a hundred times and i ca n't go through it without crying
i defy anyone to watch the reunion of celie and nettie or shug and father and not feel your eyes getting misty
whoopie goldberg should have one an award for amazing portrayal
and for the person who said you ca n't love the movie if you loved the book wrong
im a testament to that
i 've seen this movie at least fifty times and after watching it last week for the first time in a long time i still felt itbr br the story itself was incredible but came alive by spielberg 's expertise and the fabulous cast including whoopi goldberg oprah winfrey danny glover and margaret avery
akosua busia deserved an oscar nomination for her short but powerful portrayal of nettiebr br you 'll experience every human emotion while watching this film
i laughed cried and got angry
like most great movies it was looked over by the academy with a host of nominations but no wins
but this movie without a doubt is definitely one of the best films of all time
i remember when this film was up for the academy awards and did not win in any category
for the life of me i cannot remember what it was up against but one thing i can say it was one of the best movies i have ever seen
and the fact that steven spielberg directed the film did not persuade me one bitbr br essentially it is about a black woman 's trials and tribulations as she is growing up from a girl to a woman
there are a lot of insinuations that are disturbing and horrifying but all of them are needed to see how much this woman has put up with
along the way we see other women who have had to put up with their hardships and walk with them to redemption
whoopi goldberg gives her best performance ever in this movie
danny glover should have also gotten at least nominated for his role in this film
br br and the best part of this movie is that it treats its subjects humanely not like some sideshow freak shows like the more recent beloved did
i encourage anyone of any race to see this film
910
steven spielberg wanted to win an oscar so bad that he figured that he would n't win by directing special effects epics then gets stronger throughout the film thanks to some special friends
oprah winfrey also made her film debut here and gives a great performance as sofia one of those friends' of celie
since i'm from chicago i had already known winfrey from her talk show
like goldberg what a film debut
margaret avery is terrific as shug avery another friend who also happens to be the mistress of celie 's rotten husband
all three actresses received welldeserved oscar nominations for their work here
set in the south during the first half of the 20th century the color purple is a film so strong that it made me cry at the end
it also made me laugh at times too
why academy voters were so hard on not nominating spielberg for best director is a mystery that still puzzles me today
but spielberg would eventully go on to win two oscars years later for schindler 's list and saving private ryan making him one of the best movie directors of alltime
but he should have gotten nominated for this movie
the job that he did going from special effects blockbusters like et
to a serious drama like the color purple was remarkablebr br
this movie is such a moving amazing piece of work
i saw it at the theater when it came out but i was only 13 did n't really quite get it i saw it again when i was 20 was just blown away
steven spielberg created a wonderful movie that keeps you wrapped up in it from beginning to end
i have read the book as well but there is just something about the movie that really brings it to life
the casting acting music costuming scenery everything it just wonderful
you laugh you cry you cheer it brings out every emotion imaginable
it is one of his finest pieces of work should not be missed
rating 1010 master piecebr br some years ago i heard spielberg comment that he would redo the movie here and there if he had a chance
well mr spielberg i guess nothing is perfect but this movie together with schindler 's list is your best
even oprah acts well in this one br br what got me most is the realism of the story and drama
stuff like this happened and is still happening in the world
this was one of the most moving movies i have ever seen
i was about 12 years old when i watched it for the first time and whenever it is on tv i my eyes are glued to it
the acting and plot are amazing
it seems so true to reality and it touches on so many controversial topics
i recommend this movie to anyone interested in a good drama
spielberg 's first dramatic film is no letdown
it 's a beautifully made film without any flaws about the life of an africanamerican woman
it also proves that not all movies that have the africanamerican ethnicity as the center of the story have to be helmed by an africanamerican directorbr br what i love about this movie is spielberg 's ability to make it very realistic despite the fact that it was based on a book
furthermore danny glover was excellent as mr and usually he 's just himself throughout most of his movies
but in this he completely branches out and is someone else for once
but the performance de resistance of the whole film comes from whoopi goldberg
she is excellent as celie
you will never forget these characters once you 've seen this moviebr br now i heard that the musical version of it is going to be a film as well and all i can say is i hope it 's about as good as this one is because this one is a film that should n't be missed
genteel softly spoken drama from steven spielberg was his first real venture into this genre
a departure from his normal adventurefantasy fare it paved the way for his 1993 success schindler 's listbr br based upon alice walder 's pulitzer prize winning novel the story concerns a young girl 's arranged marriage of hardship to a brutal angry farmer and her painful separation from her beloved younger sister nettie
while the plot about compassion abuse and the power of love to heal all wounds is often powerful and moving it loses its way through the fault of continuity and menno meyjes' scrambling screenplay
the color purple is at times hard to follow and on one or more occasions tends to be a little erratic in regard to time frame
this lapse in scripting has cost the viewer the depth and detail obviously present in miss walker 's novel
a real shame that maestro spielberg was unable to pick out and rectify these problems as most of the show is a wonderful example of his prowess as a directorbr br performances are strong throughout with whoopi goldberg making a debut which she 's never matched since with regard to acting accomplishment as the heart broken celie who just yearns to be loved
danny glover lends solid support though his moses was a superior turn for him in places in the heart
the standout showing comes from the unheralded oprah winfrey as miss sophia the single minded fighting black woman whose spirit is crushed by a terrible incident involving a patronising upper class white woman
good support also from margaret avery adolph caesar and rae dawn chongbr br quincy jones has penned a beautifully melodic score and also provided some original blues for the occasion
editing from michael kahn is sound as always while director of photography allen daviau shows consummate skill in capturing some glorious southern scenerybr br this true affair of the heart will surely bring a tear to your eye it is just unfortunate we are left with so many unanswered questionsbr br wednesday january 15 1997 video
these days spielberg 's the color purple is mostly remembered for being nominated for eleven oscars and winning zilch
what 's even more alarming is that spielberg himself was n't even nominated for best director
needless to say the filmmakers deserved more acclaim than they were accordedbr br the story concerns the trials and tribulations of celie johnson an africanamerican woman dominated at first by her incestuous father and then by her abusive husband
the film spans several years and focuses mainly on celie 's relationships with the women around her
it 's told from a decidedly female perspective but you need n't fear that it 's a saccharine 'chick flick'br br the story is an interesting one livened with humour at times although the central character 's struggles are paramount
some may not appreciate the change in tone towards the film 's end but i did n't mind even though similar content in a lesser film would likely have me rolling my eyesbr br the film received three oscar nominations for acting whoopi goldberg oprah winfrey and margaret avery
i think that goldberg and winfrey were certainly deserving and danny glover was unaccountably stiffedbr br as already mentioned spielberg did n't receive a best director nomination for his efforts
such an omission beggars belief since spielberg 's direction here is topnotch
i'm not especially crazy about quincy jones 's score but it 's not below average by any meansbr br in the end the story is a satisfying one welltold by a master filmmaker working from pulitzer prizewinning material
give it a try and you 'll probably be as baffled as i am about how it could be so poorly treated on oscar night
1985 was a good year for films maybe even great but this one missing out on a gong went a long way to convincing fans that ol' oscar is little more that a hood ornament for good party membersbr br 11 nominations and not a single title such was the academy 's disdain for one of their greatest directors and one who had to wait another 8 years before whatever prejudices had prevented them from handing him the statue before allowed them to give him 7 for schindler 's list which is arguably not as good br br do n't get me wrong schindler was a classic
and i'm not knocking 'out of africa' either but it was in my mind a class behind this one an epic story of suffering and hope that brought me to tears and i'm not a big cryerbr br maybe it was the music or the cinematography but more likely simply the acting whoopi who proved to all of us that she was much more than just a comedienne danny glover who i 'd never heard of before and of course oprahbr br the rest is history but at the time who knew
taking a break from his escapist run in the early '80s steven spielberg directed whoopi goldberg in an adaptation of alice walker 's the color purple about about the desperate existence of an africanamerican woman in the 1930s
watching goldberg play celie it 's incredible that this is the same woman who starred in movies like sister act
this is the sort of movie that could easily be no make that should be part of the curriculum in black studies and women 's studies
there 's one scene that may be the most magnificent editing job that 's ever been on screen
i ca n't believe that this did n't win a single oscar it may be spielberg 's second best movie behind schindler 's list
also starring danny glover adolph caesar margaret avery oprah winfrey willard e pugh akosua busia and laurence fishburne
i gave this film 10 not because it is a superbly consistent movie but for it 's pure ability to evoke emotions in its audience
the story of onewoman 'sstruggleagainstallodds is an old clich by now but very few films have carried it off with so much warmth and sincerity as the color purplebr br it also showed a different side to the africanamerican experience showing that after slaves were granted freedom many fell into the ways of the hated 'white man' and were abusive of their own people
i find this an important point as it goes against the portraywhiteonblackviolenceandwinanoscar trendbr br also the acting performances are superb especially oprah who i now have a new found respect forbr br well worth watching but keep some tissue handy
one of the finest films ever made
why it only got a 76 rating is a mystery
this film is a window into the world of the black experience in america
should be mandatory viewing for all white people and all children above age 10 i recommend watching it with the long walk home as a companion piece
if you think whoopi goldberg 's work is about homer and eddie or hollywood squares think again
do n't miss this movie which should have won the oscar
this film captured my heart from the very beginning when hearing quincy jones' first notes or seeing the wonderful color of purple of the flowers in the meadows
this is truly a film to cry and die for
the whole cast gives the best performance in a film i 've seen in years and spielberg has really outdone himself
whoppi goldberg margaret avery oprah winfrey danny glover and the others all give us their best and you can feel it almost touch it
goldberg is celie she gives her that insecurity and feeling of inferiority that is needed for the character and we grow with her we grow strong together with her throughout the movie and we triumph with her
margaret avery is wonderful as shug avery even when she 's at her most arrogant and shows us that sinners indeed have souls too
the always sympathetic charming danny glover makes a marvellous job at making people hate him and the magnificent music ofquincy jones adds even more beauty to this splendid film
the photography the music the director and the music makes this beautiful soulful movie into an experience of life
you do n't want to miss it
sista' remember my name
the film version of alice walker 's hugely emotive and influential 1983 novel was a massive oscar success and rightly sobr br in the role of the abused and awakened celie whoopi goldberg gave her best screen performance by miles
not far behind her was oprah winfrey as sofia the fiery woman tamed by fate
others in the cast fleshed out the characters walker had introduced so clearly on the page danny glover as albert celie 's abusive husband margaret avery as shug a force of change for the good willard pugh and rae dawn chong as harpo and squeak susan beaubian as corrine the preacher 's wife and the muchmissed carl anderson as preacher samuelbr br beautifully paced and sensitively written 'the color purple' does justice to its source while opening out the story to involve viewers of a featurelength drama
a film that can make you shed tears of sadness and tears of joy would be considered quite a step in the career of a common filmmaker
the fact is steven spielberg probably our greatest storyteller has been doing this in various movie formats for years
the color purple at the time was considered risky especially after action classics like jaws and raiders of the lost ark
in hindsight this film should have come as no surprise for spielberg had made us cry tears of joy and sadness in et
critics called color purple his entrance into intellectual fare
it is quite an entrance
no special effects no swashbuckling just brilliant storytelling based on a literary classic by alice walker
one surprise is how spielberg could present such a moving film about africanamericans in the deep south
slavery is gone but in the south depicted here it seems as though blacks are using other blacks as slaves
br br spielberg is always put down for sentimentalizing his pictures or adding an element of childishness to please the audience
this is really the first of overlooked films from his career that you cannot make these observations
it is the first in a line of films people either did n't see or would n't see because there are no aliens
empire of the sun always schindler 's list etc his awesome talent is obvious with this specific picture because a he uses mostly untrained firsttime actors b he tackles a subject most felt was unadaptable to the screen and c it is pure drama with no strings pulled where characters grow and change over the passage of roughly 30 years
it is almost epiclike in look and scope and the fact that it did not garner a single academy award from 11 nominations is a travesty and an insultbr br whoopi goldberg is fabulous as the tortured celie an unattractive woman given away by her incestuous father to an abusive danny glover who she only knows as mister
the film follows a path of occasional beatings and mental torture she goes through while with mister
the pg13 rated film is pretty open to the sexual issues raised by the walker novel
this is not the burning bed in georgia by any means
there is no blatant revenge taken as might be expected
it happens gracefully
goldberg perfectly plays a human being someone in need of love and someone who deserves it
the films' most poignant and heartbreaking moment comes when goldberg and her sister nettie are separated maybe forever
you may have to check for a pulse if you are not moved by this sequencebr br the color purple stands for the beauty of the fields and flowers surrounding these poor people
there really is something to live for but love triumphs over all
spielberg bashers take note the guy can make an unforgettable classic without any cute aliensbr br rating 10 of 10
tsui hark 's visual artistry is at its peek in this movie
unfortunately the terrible acting by ekin cheng and especially cecilia cheung made it difficult to watch at timesbr br this movie is a real breakthrough in the visual department
when i first saw this my jaw dropped repeatedly and i thought to myself that i 've never seen anything remotely like it but this is how it should be done in order to do full justice to the mythical world of chinese historical kungfu novels
without a doubt this is one of the bestlooking chinese historical kungfu epic ever madebr br but alas tsui hark has n't improved much in the writing department and the story and dialog are rather juvenile
to make it worse this movie is very badly cast
they decided to use the hot popular hong kong idols as lead characters but unfortunately both ekin cheng and especially cecilia cheung are totally unsuited for historical kungfu dramas because they lack the nobility and mystique that such characters are supposed to embody
adam cheng siuchow and brigitte lin in the 1983 version are infinitely betterbr br i wish that someday zhang yimou and tsui hark can join forces and produce a movie that has the visual artistry of tsui but with the maturity and storytelling poetry of zhang
this movie is good
it 's not the best of the great cg kung fu flicks but its pretty good
first thing first the story is actually good
the whole idea of gods vs fallen gods type deal with super powers is pretty cool
my problem is theres too many characters
it got very confusing when they switched scenes
the special effects were incredible
the fighting scenes were very fast paced and complex
this movie practically all computer generated
the acting is superb as always expected from such high profile players
ekin cheng makes an excellent protagonist loner character
zhang ziyi did nothing for me in this movie
i thought she would have a bigger part but she did one fight scene and a whole lot of yapping
the bad guy the whole skull army and the whole blood cloud thing is very frightening
the music is also excellent
to me this story deserve at least a miniseries and not just one movie
theres too much story to cram in 2 hours
maybe if there was a book or something i would be able to keep up with all the characters and the details
this movie sacrifices story integrity for action
i reccomend storm riders over this any day
and i love it
lots of special effects and for a movie that 's not made on mega budget this movie really does great job of creating a fantasy masterpiece
i'm one of the guys who did n't understand the story at all but this was still a great flick to watch
it 's definitely up there in standards surpassing bored of the rings and on par with movies like harry potter
which is saying a lot for a movie again made on a fraction of the budget of these international hitsbr br one thing i really love about this movie is that it so stretches the envelope of adventure movie to come out of hong kong
the topic is exotic and original
production quality is unlike anything seen coming out of hk for fantasy action movie and acting is greatbr br one of the best movies to come out of hong kong this is the infernal affairs of hong kong fantasy movie and i hope they 'll continue working in this area until they surpass hollywood adventure moviesbr br just fantastic
yeah right
sammo hung already acted in the main role in 1983 's zu warrios from the magic mountain
now 2001 he does it again with zu warriors
but this time he finally does it right
you seldom see him in wuxia more often in classic eastern or crime slapstick
but this role simply does fit him
the ancient chinese legend about zu mountain is not often represented in movies
although the legend contains a vast of interesting stories and possibilities
straight said you have n't seen a story alike yet in a modern movie
and that makes it so great
and wow all the colors plus the enormously deep rightintotheheart going story makes you fall for this movie in an instant
the first time i watched it i had to watch it again instantly and i did
ok true i did n't understand all of it the first time
but that makes it only better
you know you did n't understand all of it because there is so much spice in it
therefor it is a pleasure for one self to watch it over and over again
and yeah it grows deeper in your heart the more often you watch itbr br summary a story to love characters you cry with and truly a movie you never forget
editors note well i think i must watch it right now again d
the first thing i thought when i saw this films was it is not really a film at least it is not what we imagine spontaneously when we hear the word film
it is entirely symbolic everything in it has a figurative meaning
so if you are not used to express thing in a symbolic way you will find it strange if you are not acquainted with philosophy religion spiritual life you will think it 's just a fairytale and even a weird one chaotic
for me the legend of zu is perfectly transparent
and i do like it
it tells us in images the story about the fight between light and darkness the fight that is as old as humanity and every one who is in search of the sens in this life is confronted with it
the film is obviously made by buddhists
i am not a buddhist
my religion and the vision of the world and human is different
but as far as we are all humans and have the same human nature we necessarily have common experiences and can understand each other
it is a really beautiful film
and i which we had more films like this films that have a meaning
there are too many empty stories which are good only to make time pass more quickly
zuthe warriors from magic mountain was and is an impressive classic
you never would have guessed it was made in 1983 tsui hark 's use of special effects was very creative and inventive
even now it can measure up to other movies in this genre
legend of zu is connected to zuwarriors from magic mountain
it is not necessary to have seen this movie to understand the plot of this one
the plot is a bit hard to follow
but to be honest it does n't matter
it is all about the action and adventure
i always was wondering what tsui hark would do if he got his hands on cgi
now we knowhe made this movie
maybe it sometimes is too much but the overall result is so beautiful that i am not going to be critical about that
there is so much happening on the screenyou simply wo n't believe
i think it is a big shame that this movie was n't shown in theaters here in holland
because this movie is screaming for screen time in cinemas
this movie easily can beat big budget hollywood productions like superman returns or xmen 3 the only thing i do have to mention is the lack of humor
in most of tsui harks 's movies he combines dramafantasymartial arts and humor
somehow it is missing in this movie
again i am not going to be picky about these small matters
legend of zu delivers on the action front with the most beautiful special effects you will see
a true classic
the legend of zu as i saw it was a very interesting story
i think many of the people who did n't like it were not seeing the underlying mythology behind the film
they were expecting something akin to star wars and it was not that
joseph campbell i believe would have liked this film
there were a number of metaphors and hidden meanings that an average viewer might have overlooked
we all have a mountain of swords within us
we all have to go into our own cave of blood sometime in our lives
we all have to face our own insomnia someday
granted some of the narration was a bit confusing and some of the action got a little hokey at times but i think other points of the film easily made up for it
i 'd watch it again
br br i do n't know if there 's a difference between the legend of zu and zu warriors it might have been dumbed down for american audiences which really would have detracted from this film
for those of you who love lord of the rings and love special effects watch this movie
this will be sure to keep you glued to the screen
you will probably even like it if you like watching people fight with magical stuff
this is an incredible comeback from movie director mastermind tsui hark
it is one of a few movies that deserves to come a face to face match to steven chow 's shaolin soccer
from the moment the movie startedthere was astronishing backdrops at every edge which werebr br deplicted with superb style
if you are a science fiction or chinese martial arts geek you 'll love the excessive amounts of many 3d effects and realistic computer generated weapons
there comes a fine performance from ekin cheung who plays sky king
he teams up with louis koo who i was very impressed by his flexible wing which deflected incoming attacks
the fighting movements of these actors were proficient in every way
not only is the action superb but the has a somewhat complex storyline
many criticisers of this movie complain of the lack of storytheme or just shoved in random bits of debrise and even describe as the legend of poo
however the viewer cannot rely on watching dragon ballz and other similar manga cartoons to understand this movie
others who are famarialy with wu xia movies will have a better appoach
in due respect
there can be one weakness that could be foreseen
the blow that was deliveried to the enemy at the very last fight scene could of been more substantially and devastiingly madein spite of all this its a must see
visually stunning and full of eastern philosophy this amazing martial arts fantasy is brought to you by master director tsui hark the man behind some of the best films hong kong cinema has produced
the special effects are beautiful and imaginative
the plot is a bit on the cerebral side but is a refreshing change from films that treat their audience as if they were morons
if thinking is not your forte however this may not be your movie
maybe you should go see the latest from the hollywood studio 's no brain club but if you are looking for something more he 's where you will find it
legend of zubr br i remember well tsui hark 's original zu warriors made 18 years earlier
over one christmas on a rare week when channel 4 in the uk showed a week of hong kong movies zu warriors was so gripping for a very young viewer and his brother and so memorable that it 's been etched into the memory of the now grown up sprog br br in fact i think the original zu warriors is one of the earliest films i saw as a kid that i can clearly recall the story line and action scenes from
and the memories of seeing yuen biao sammo hung and others in their classic primebr br so when i saw this remake of zu warriors there was a feeling of apprehension
could it beat the dreamy childhood memories i had of the original or will it follow the road of other remakes and die a death more horrible than the baddies and their broken necks you find in those kung fu moviesbr br well the answer is i ca n't say
but that was because this is n't really a remake
the stories are almost completely differentbr br the legend of zu tells of the story of king sky a lone warrior whose master dawn declares her love for him but her life is taken from her by a monster called insomnia
two hundred years later insomnia returns dawn is reincarnated as enigma and insomnia has returned to destroy zu
meanwhile white eyebrows and red try with the help of king sky to stop insomniabr br the plot is n't one full of twists and turns but had enough detail in it to keep me interested
but i can see this film as one you either love or you hate
the film is very much about the special effects with the majority of it involving several computer generated environments much like the storm riders and a man called hero
but unlike the other two this film was one which did n't overdo the graphics and the whole thing was tasteful
nothing appears rushed unlike hero
the backgrounds were complementary to the acting and not at all overpowering the scenesbr br the story also involves plenty of characters and the intermingling of so many individuals does make the film intriguing
it was possibly on the verge of 'too many cooks' but generally each character had its part in the story
but some of the roles appear to be 'extended cameos' in my opinion and i somehow am left to slightly question the necessity of thisbr br ekin cheng and louis koo play very central roles in the film but i could n't say this film showed their best performances
cecilia cheung appears to at least have matured in her acting but it is still quite raw
kelly lin was the new revelation for me
despite her very short role i have apologise and admit to oglingbr br overall i have to say did enjoy this film as much as i enjoyed the 'original'
given that both movies are made by the legendary tsui hark the two films together are part of a chronicle showing how film making in hong kong has changed over two decades
and one beauty of that is the fact that you ca n't really compare the two films at all as much as apples are apples and pears are pearsbr br ultimately both are thoroughly enjoyable films in their own right
and i'm going back to reminisce by watching the original againbr br two to watch but not compare
i have to admit that tsui hark is one of a kind you ca n't top a person with a strong style of movie presence
a chinese fantasy picture may not be easy to present to an audience the director attempted to bring back the classic fantasy tales of zu mountain and this is what he displayedbr br the new legend of zu has truly improved from the one in 1983 from this new millenium update we could see tsui hark 's vision of the zu mountains
spectacular visual designs amazing actionfantasy epic made beautifully well
kept me glued through the entire picture
great cast with just fine acting
it 's truly a fun movie to watch but is it too weirdbr br now the down side is people will definitely get confused with it 's broad story line shortened down into a 95 minute movie
plot may not have much relation among characters but by rewatching the movie you 'll have a better sense of understanding the characters itself
some can complain there is n't too much physical combat besides with characters that have supernatural powers to defeat foes spirits fighting by handtohand would n't really make sense at all
br br i appreciated this nice stylish picture
it may have a thin story but hey look at tsui hark 's time tide we got confused by the plot as well but it was truly something stylish and awesome
tsui hark always attracts something different into hk
cinema
american audiences may have some difficulty to understand while watching this movie cause this ai n't no crouching tiger hidden dragon this is a whole new genre
although it may not be a masterpiece but it 's special effects is truly better than storm riders
this is really worth checking out
i'm stunt i must admit i never saw a movie with such good story and none stop high special effect martial art fighting scene
if you like the fantastic genre like me you will certainly be more than satisfied
all character have very cool power and the special effect are near perfection in one word flawless
i will listen to this movie a lot in the next years
this movie is very cool
if you 're a fan of tsui hark and chinese fantasy films you should love this
this film is the asian lord of the rings a high fantasy story based in actual chinese mythology
if you liked stormriders or warriors of heaven earth this one should be right up your alley
this film is still very difficult to find in the us even though it was purchased for us distribution along with crouching tiger hidden dragon and iron monkey
well worth the search
this dvd is also worthy of owning
when tsui hark experiments nothing and no one can withstand him
legend of zu is possibly 6hours condensed into 1h40
one does not understand all but like at 2001 a space odyssey you also do n't have to but one feels the power of the film to every second every picture
an extraordinary vision of the future of the 7th art and the one of the most pioneering astounding rejoicing in the recent years
vital severe masterpiece
it 's absolutely perfect as it isbr br when tsui hark experiments nothing and no one can withstand him

one does not understand all but one feels the power of the film to every second every picture

1000000000000010000000000000
i just came back from hong kong on my summer vacation and saw the legend of zu
i thought it kicked as
it was so creative and unique
it 's the crouching tiger hidden dragon with a lot less drama
even if some thought there was too much special fx you ca n't complain about the cast
zhang ziyi and cecilia cheung are so fine
the legend of zu kicks as
i have previously seen zu warriors from the magic mountain
in that film the setting takes place in china 's mountains the legend of zu looks like another dimension
thank that to tsui hark 's extensive use of cgi effects
he 's able to portray his vision of mountains floating above the clouds a land where beings fly freely and powers ranging from razor sharp wing blades split swords and the ultra cool moon orbbr br while there are many characters in this one the focus is mainly on king sky and enigma
the romance aspect is there although the movie seems much darker than its predecessor
cecilia cheung is beautiful and her presence on screen makes this movie worth watching
in the beginning i like how she resembles the countess and she does well playing enigma as she deals with facing her past life
oh by the way did i mention that cecilia 's very appealing to the eye
br br in truth zu warriors had more comedy elements and its special effects were limited due to its time in 1983 tsui hark takes it to a whole new level and sets a new standard in cinema
i remember that the trailer for legend of zu was quite impressive and being a fan of a man called hero storm riders i decided that i must watch this one too
i know that there is way to much critcism on ekin cheng 's acting ability everywhere but he is my favourite hong kong moviestar so far and he is one of the factors that i enjoyed this movie
without a doubt this film is a work of art from the beginning to the end
i even thought that only the actors were real and everything else was computer generated by the end of this film
they must have put a lot of work into this one and they deserve good credit for that
the storyline of the movie was a fairytale between good and evil with a love story thrown in the story is not very intellectual and deep but that is not what you expect when watcing an action movie
i wished there were more martial arts action with fists and fist instead of battles with magical abilities but well that 's life and it never goes the way you want it to
and why did they sound like supersonic planes in the battle through the sky in the end
that 's way too funny
legend of zu cannot be a man called hero in my eyes but it flows like a videogame and that is not a bad thing at all
if a company decides to publish games on this movie i will not get suprised as it carries all the videogames elements
good work
please make more fantasy movies like this
this is like crouching tiger hidden dragon in a more surreal fantasy setting with incredible special effects and computer generated imagery that would put industrial light and magic to shame
the plot may be hard to follow but that is the nature of translating chinese folklore to the screen certainly the overall story would probably be more familiar to its native audience
however an intelligent person should be able to keep up moreover the martial arts scenes potency are amplified by eye popping cgi
i 've been a fan of xu ke for many year since school
this film is the best fantasy movie in years
i dont think action is the right genre though there 're lot of action and kongfu scenese
wait did i mentioned this is an oriental fantasy moive
please keep in mind that do not use hollywood formula to rate this film
and for the guy who poo around i do n't blame you 'cause you still young and need to know more about culture
this is one amazing movie
you have to realize that chinese folklore is complicated and philosophical
there are always stories behind stories
i myself did not understand everything but knowing chinese folklore it is very complicated
you just have to take what it gives you enjoy the movie and enjoy the ride
hooray
o my gosh just give me a minute to breath
this movie takes you on an awesome ride and does n't let you go until the very last blow in your face ending
this is the the movie for fans of stormriders and such
legend of zu was beautifully created although i did n't like a few things they used alot of stand ins
i wanted to see the real person fight but oh well a few small let downsand i did n't really like it a lot until i watched it again when you understand it more it totally kicks a
i encourage anyone who ever wanted to see a true asian movie to see this movie
i give this movie one of my highest ratingsgo and see it when it comes out in america
i ca n't tell you all how much i love this movie
i have read reviews that say that this move is too confusing or like swimming in drying concrete
i say that these reviewers have no imagination
for anyone who loves fantasy fiction this movie is for you
if you ever loved playing dungeons dragons this movie is for you i'm just sorry that i did not get to see this movie on the big screen
legend of zu is possibly the most exciting movie ive seen in recent years
it transcends all expectations and is truly a work of art
with unmatched visual sceneries and story of divine proportions legend of zu proceeds to blow over its viewers with its majesty
this movie is wonderously crafted through the use of high tech cgi which allows fans of the fantasy genre to see their visions come to life
the acting is perfect for this type of movie if you were an immortal with supernatural powers i would think you 'd keep more to yourselfbr br unlike the comments of many the plot is actually quite easy to follow while maintaining a quick pace that adds a sense of urgency
anyone that cannot keep track of the different characters simply must not be paying attention since or are used to such levels of sophistication as the titanic
the plot is engaging and layered with themes so epic that they will leave you gasping for air
legend of zu is on a level of greatness so high that perhaps many people are put off by its grandeur
allow yourself to be completely engulfed within its fantastical vision and you will grow to love this movie
i rented this film in dvd form without knowing anything at all about it part of a winter marathon of watching a film every night
after several awful american action adventure films zhu warriors struck me as brilliantly original filmmaking
the story is complete nonsense but i found the film 's sincerity good heartedness and complete lack of irony refreshing and the film looks spectacular
sure the special effects are not technically as flawless as those produced by hollywood but the filmmakers wisely are more interested in color composition and movement than realism and so many of the shots are breathtaking
in one shot two of the superhuman characters stand on craggy spires of rock a huge moon rising before them the image perfectly balanced by the three elements
in another a princesswarrior spires through the heavens behind her glowing sword like a heatseeking missile
and the colors explode from shot to shot used to express emotion rather than to represent realitybr br the characters have the same simplicity and directness of comic book characters offering no great depth in themselves but referring to archtypes that resonate more deeply
physically several of the actors are astonishingly beautiful
they play their roles straight up without irony or guile and so are believablebr br most strange of all despite the clumsiness of plot and thin characterizations i found myself very near tears at the end moved by the beautiful simplicity of the actors and the wildly original goodhearted vision of the directorbr br
this movie is well done on so many levels that i am in awe that the score is as low as it is as of this writing
this movie has incredible special effects a true epic storyline complex great character interaction and mindblowing battles they have to be seen to be believed
the only complaint i have is the subtitles on the hk dvd version i got br br i just do n't understand when i read hear from various sources it has a confusing plot i could n't follow the story or characters came from nowhere
from the very 1st time i watched this movie i understood it followed it knew why characters were there and i absolutely loved it
i 've watched it about 8 times already and each time it is pure enjoyment
oh and this is not just my opinion because i 've shown this movie to many fellow americans who feel the same way
not one of them failed to follow the storyline and each person declared their love for this movie
oh man why ca n't we have stuff like this coming out of hollywood
at least lord of the rings had a nice marriage of special effects character development and storylinebr br this is not coming from a asian film lover newbie either
i own an extensive library of asian films and i must say that this movie is one of my greatest dvds
when you watch it you will be blown away by the amazing special effects and epic feel of this movie
you will be drawn into this fantasy world and you wo n't want to leave
i 've seen both the 1983 version and the 2001 and the 2001 is far better in comparison imobr br besides the subtitles i have one additional complaint about this movie i did n't want it to end i'm begging you mr hark can we please have a sequel
i liked this movie because it told a very interesting story about living in a totally different world at the south pole
susan sarandon is such a good actor that she made an interesting strong character out of mediocre writing
the true story displays a devastating situation for her character to overcome
sure this movie is not historically accurate but it is great entertainment
most demille pictures especially the later epics are slow and plodding but the action here moves at a clip
the story is basically a series of peaks with very little quiet moments
the action takes us from an indian raid on a cabin one of the best parts of the movie with jean arthur excellent while attempting to appease the warpainted natives
this is followed by her and cooper being taken to the war camp and being tortured
later comes a protracted battle with the cheyenne
the whole thing is ridiculous but great fun and entertaining from start to finish
jean arthur is one of the best actresses of this era and she shines here
cecil b demille really knew how to create a classic and after 7 decades his western comes across as the real mccoy engrossing entertaining spectacular in no way outdatedbr br as a real fan of tv 's deadwood i 'll tell you the performances of gary cooper as wild bill hickock and jean arthor as calamity jane are far more ontargetbr br we do n't have any giants in hollywood anymore
plainsman is just one of dozens of classics from the 19361945 decade that have seen enduring commercial life decade after decade released reissued reissued all over again
filmmakers like today 's spielberg jackson bruckheimer are like kids playing in a sandbox
none of today 's movies will be sought out in 7 months let alone 70 years
the master of movie spectacle cecil b de mille goes west
using three legends of the old west as its protagonists gary cooper is portraying wild bill hickockjames ellison as buffalo bill and jean arthur does make a nice calamity jane
the story serves only for de mille to hang some marvelous action sequences on like the big indian attackscenes like that are extremely well doneif you do n't mind the somewhat overthetop performances of the cast this is an very entertaining westernlook out for a very young anthony quinn essaying the role of an indian brave who participated at the battle of little big hornthis part got him at least noticed in hollywood
the plainsman is an entertaining western no doubt a classic which is actual even today
gary cooper is wild bill hickok ideal for the role together with john wayne and james stewart they were the best actors that played western heroes in their generation
jean arthur is great as calamity jane nobody that i know played it better than her
even if might not be historically accurate the film manages to capture the most important about hickok and about the time it takes place
sometimes you have to sacrifice history to make your point and that is what demille does here
the friendship of hickok with buffalo bill the selling of rifles to the indians by a great manufacturer to compensate for the losses he would have because of the end of the civil war custer and little big horn the uneasy relationship between buffalo bill 's wife a religious woman with hickok a man who had killed plenty also the unusual love affair between hickok and calamity all this makes 'the plainsman' a non conventional and interesting film
anthony quinn has a very short appearance that already shows what a great actor he was going to become
a lot of care was taken to show the original guns of that time
this movie has wild bill hickok calamity jane buffalo bill and general custer all together
gary cooper plays wild bill and jean arthur plays calamity jane and charles bickford plays the bad guy who sells weapons to the indians and you can hardly recognize him
this was the first time cecil b demille and gary cooper worked together and the next movie the made was basically the same but set in a different time
this movie starts out with lincoln 's assassination and it also deals with an indian war
calamity jane is in love with wild bill and buffalo bill has gotten married and now wants to stay home
this movie also deals with custer 's last stand and is far from accurate
gary cooper is good as usual and i usually do n't like jean arthur but i liked her here
this a rip roaring western and i have watched it many times and it entertains on every levelhowever if your after the true facts about such legends as hickcockcody and calamity jane then look elsewhere as john ford suggested this is the west when the truth becomes legend print the legendthe story moves with a cracking pace and there is some great dialogue between gary cooper and jean arthur two very watchable stars who help to make this moviethe sharp eyed amongst you might just spot gabby hayes as an indian scout also there is a very young anthony quinn making his debut as cayenne warrior he actually married one of demilles daughters in real lifeindeed its quinns character who informs cooper of the massacre of custer told in flash back the finale is well done and when the credits roll it fuses the american west with american historyso please take time out to watch this classic western
this cecil b demille epic of the old west contains what may be jean arthur 's finest performance as a hysterical eccentric incurably amoral but devotedly doting calamity jane
she really pulled it off
gary cooper is at his most taciturn but manages some occasional pithy sayings 'the plains are big but trails cross
sometimes'
the story is a pastiche to end all pastiches
all the cowboy heroes of western lore seem to be in there somehow except for jesse james
even abraham lincoln opens the story in person
there is no room for anything so evanescent as subtlety this is a 'stomp 'em in the face' tale for the masses
a remarkable thing about this film however is that it is a very early full frontal attack on what eisenhower was eventually to name 'the military industrial complex'
it is n't just a story about gunrunners but about arming anyone for money and doing so from the heart of washington
but let 's not get into politics let 's leave that to demille who can be guaranteed to be superficial
the chief interest of this film all these years later is that it uses the first film score composed by george antheil who has a lot to say about the job in his autobiography 'bad boy of music'
antheil seems to have originated 'the big sound' adopted by all subsequent westerns whereby the plains sing out with the voices and sounds of countless cowboys in the sky celebrating the open spaces and interweaving common melodies
that is why it does not sound at all unusual because we have heard it a thousand times
but he seems to have been the first to summon up the combined rustlings of all the sage brush into this symphony of the open skies which has entered into american mythic lore and given it a soundtrack which has never varied since then corny as it may be but doubtless appropriate
it is amusing to see anthony quinn in an early appearance as a cheyenne indian
gabby hayes is in there somewhere but you miss him in the crowd
gary cooper overtops them all looming large but when did he ever loom small
this film provides the saga of a legendary wild bill hickock
he buffalo bill cody and calamity jane are the central charactersbr br as the civil war closes lincoln mentions his concern that the country 's dynamism would be enhanced if people would follow the advice go west young man which mercifully the film did n't erroneously attribute to horace greeley as a number of others did
but then he gets assassinated and some financiers speculate that they can get rich selling weapons to the american indiansbr br in the meantime we see wild bill hickock who interacts with a small boy while a steamboat is loading at a dock along the mississippi
wild bill uses a bowie knife which he eventually gives to the boy calling it an arkansas toothpick which in reality was a different type of knife though both were used throughout the frontierbr br hickock eventually meets buffalo bill cody who looks close to the photographs and paintings of the actual man
cody has just gotten married and is bringing his bride to the old west to settle downbr br when they arrive at their destination they run into calamity jane who has a crush on hickock
she looks at cody 's wife and asks buffalo bill is this your mopsy
the line was one that caused the hayes board some problem since one definition of mopsy was prostitute
demille wanted the line in and one of his aides pointed out that in beatrix potter 's books about peter rabbit three of the rabbits were flopsy mopsy and cottontail
he pointed this out and asked the censors to identify the rabbit of ill virtue
it worked the line stayed inbr br the indians were getting restless in part because of the superior weaponry they got from the agent of the eastern financiers
cody and hickock were asked to help scout the area so that troops could get safely through to a beleaguered area
cody led the troops hickock went to check out the activities of an indian chief who was an old acquaintance and who was leading some of the hostile indiansbr br calamity jane gets captured and hickock gets captured trying to save her
they are brought to the chief and although neither would talk torture applied to hickock breaks calamity jane 's willpower and she tells the route cody is usingbr br the two are released and hickock joins up with cody and his forces in part to alert them they 're walking into a trap
with hickok 's help they hold off the indian attackbr br hickock decides to go after the gun runners and finally takes them prisoner
as they 're waiting for authorities hickock is gunned down by being shot in the back while playing cardsbr br there are numerous historic anomalies in the film but it retains the flavor of legend
pretty good for the 1930s
after the failure of the crusades at the box office cecil b demille stopped doing films about nonamerican history
his films for the next thirteen years were about our history from jean lafitte to world war ii
the first in order of production was this film starring gary cooper as wild bill hickok with jean arthur as calamity jane
james ellison was buffalo bill john miljan was general george a custer and anthony quinn was one of the indians who fought at little big horn
the villains were led by charles bickford and porter hall as jack mccall br br basically the film takes up the history of the us after the civil war
lincoln is shown at the start talking about what is the next step now that lee has surrendered
lincoln talks about the need to secure the west
then he announces he has to go to the theater
that april 14th must have been very busy for abe in virginia city he grants a pardon to errol flynn at the request of miriam hopkins on the same datebr br actually while lincoln was concerned about the west his immediate thoughts on the last day of his presidency were about reunifying the former confederate states and it 's citizens into the union as soon as possible
it was reconstruction that occupied his attention not the west
but he had been involved in actual problems with the west
in 1862 he sent disgraced general john pope the loser at second manassas to minnesota to put down a serious indian war by the sioux the frontier should be secure
there is nothing to say he could not have said it but it is hardly a profound pronouncement by a leading statesman
like saying teddy roosevelt said eat a good breakfast every morning for your health
it is not a profound statement of policy
it is at best a statement of recognizable fact
cooper turning it into a minor mantra like lincoln 's version of the monroe doctrine is ridiculous typical of the way demille 's scripts have really bad errors of common sense in thembr br however this is not a ruinous mistake
the plainsman is an adventure film and as such it has the full benefit of demille the film creator of spectacle
as such it is well worth watching
but not as a textbook on lincoln 's political ideas or his quotable legacy
the plainsman represents the directorial prowess of cecil b demille at its most inaccurate and unfactual
it sets up parallel plots for no less stellar an entourage than wild bill hickok buffalo bill cody calamity jane george armstrong custer and abraham lincoln to interact even though in reality lincoln was already dead at the time the story takes place
every once in a while demille floats dangerously close toward the truth but just as easily veers away from it into unabashed spectacle and showmanship
the film is an attempt to buttress custer 's last stand with a heap of fiction that is only loosely based on the lives of people who were already the product of manufactured stuffs and legends
truly this is the world according to demille a zeitgeist in the annals of entertainment but a pretty campy relic by today 's standardsbr br transfer considering the vintage of the film this is a moderately appealing transfer with often clean whites and extremely solid blacks
there 's a considerable amount of film grain in some scenes and an absence of it at other moments
all in all the image quality is therefore somewhat inconsistent but it is never all bad or all good just a bit better than middle of the road
age related artifacts are kept to a minimum and digital anomalies do not distract
the audio is mono but nicely balancedbr br extras forget it
it 's universal
bottom line as pseudohistory painted on celluloid this western is compelling and fun
just take its characters and story with a grain of salt in some cases a whole box seems more appropriate
i just read the plot summary and it is the worst one i have ever read
it does not do justice to this incredible movie
for an example of a good summary read the listing at turner classic movies
anyway this was one of my favorite movies as a young child
my sister and i could n't wait until every april when we could see it on tv
it is one of the best horse movies of it 's time
it is one of those great classics that the whole family can watch
the romance is clean and endearing
the story line is interesting and the songs are great
they do n't make movies like this anymore
good acting and not over the top
pat boone and shirley jones are at their best along with many other great character actors
i love this movie because i grew up around harness racing
pat boone behind the sulky reminds me of my father who was drawn to the trotters because unlike thoroughbred jockeys men of normal height and weight can be drivers
br br yes the 1944 home in indiana is a better movie but it 's also a very different movie
april love is light and easy to watch a feel good movie
home in indiana with walter brennan captures the stress and struggle better thereby making the ultimate accomplishment more satisfying but it requires a bigger emotional investment
i would like to comment on the movie april love
it 's one of my all time favorites because my father nelson malone plays the horse trainer
i remember distinctly when hollywood came to lexington ky where we were living at the time to make april love
my dad had been in numerous plays and was a talented man
i talked him into going to try out for one of the bit parts offered and lo and behold he came home wthe script
how exciting is that
also a number of my classmates were in the crowd scenes especially the ones shown at the amusement park
it 's very nostalgic every april when i see the movie being shown once again and the song april love by pat boone is still played on the radio
timeless and reminiscent of a time long gone when you see the movies they make today wall the sex foul language and violence
it would be refreshing to see more movies like april love come back into focus
having ran across this film on the fox movie channel on a lazy friday afternoon i can think of no better way to spend a lazy friday evening then putting in my two cents worth
especially when you consider the lack of user comments on it
does n't every movie good or bad deserve more than four comments
and this movie is n't bad at allbr br the first thing to keep in mind when watching a film like april love is to remember the era from which it came in this case the late fifties
films were pretty much a happy medium back then
the cinemas were devoid of tragedy while the screens were filled with wide screen technicolor films in order to pry people away from the gray glare of the evil medium in a box called television
i do n't know how many people were pried away from the boob tube to see this one but it managed to capture my attention for 97 minutesbr br teen idol pat boone plays nick conover a young teen sent to live with his aunt henrietta and uncle jed out in the country after being put on probation for stealing a car
it seems that his aunt and uncle have lost their own son so uncle jed seems has lost his zest for living
aunt henrietta is hoping that nick being on the farm will somehow bring jed out of his doldrums
story lines like this being what they are jed and nick do n't really care for each other too much of course
jed then proceeds to meet up with the neighbors fran and liz templeton
immediately jed develops a crush on fran and of course i do n't have to tell you that liz develops a crush on jed
then there 's the matter of uncle jed 's horse a trotter who has turned wild and wo n't let anyone handle him since the death of jed jr you could probably fill in everything that happens from that point on your own seeing as how there are no real surprises
does n't matter though you 'll enjoy yourself anywaybr br once you get over the image of squeaky clean pat boone as a supposedly bad boy you 'll have no trouble with the rest of the film
considering that boone does turn in a surprisingly good performance as nick
certainly the role does n't require much depth but still it 's a nicely done job when you would least expect it
as jed arthur o'connell is the perfect choice for the role
in the early going he is unreachable and cold but as he slowly warms up to nick we see that he 's really a pretty good guy
jeannette nolan is a lot of fun as henrietta who is constantly playing the part of mediator between jed and nick
shirley jones takes a break from rodgers and hammerstein and gets a few opportunities to grace us with her singing talents
as liz she 's gorgeous to look at great to listen to and quite funny at times
dolores michaels as fran who is a bit more on the wild side is equally entertainingbr br the best thing about april love is that there is not a true mean conniving character of any sort on the screen
not one true villain in the whole thing
everybody is so darn likable you ca n't help but enjoy the film
i truthfully find it quite refreshing sort of like putting your troubles behind you and enjoying a summer picnic with friends
think of it as the old andy griffith show with musical numbers a little more plot and wide screen technicolor
the songs are a mixed bag with the title song april love being the best of them
another thing i really liked is that they did n't fall back on using blue screen backdrops during the horse racing sequences and they quite a bit more entertaining and exciting because of it
as a matter of fact you 'll find the whole film beautifully photographed and it was nice to see they did n't skimp in that department
the chemistry between jones and boone is good
best of all is how the dislike between nick and jed is portrayed as each try in some way to gain the others respectbr br this movie will never be confused with great cinema
yet sometimes instead of going to disneyland one just needs a nice outing in the park and that 's what april love isbr br my grade bbr br
one of the best ensemble acted films i 've ever seen
there is n't much to the plot but the acting incredible
you see the characters change ever so subtly undr the influence of the rented villa in italy and love
and happiness
the film casts a mesmerizing spell on you much as the villa does on all the women
truly enchanted
two women sick of their controlling husbands taking a vacation in italy for a month with two other very different womenthey come back refreshed and energized in this wonderful little film by merchant ivorybr br great scenery and the location is n't bad either
seriously a very good period piece 7 of 10
it has been about 50 years since a movie has been made about romance and mysticism
the only two movies i can think of is enchanted april and the enchanted cottage
both movies used wonderful actors not stars
in both movies all the actors gave their best romantic performancesbr br enchanted april is about four english women after wwi who are unhappy with their lives and find happiness in italy while on vacation
it is amazing enchanted april was made in 1992 it stands out as an enjoyable classic
this was a very good film
i did n't go into it with very high expectations and was pleasantly surprised by the acting the script and the scenery
miranda richardson was fantastic and so was joan plowright
they stole the show
but the other actors played their parts wonderfully also
very enjoyable film
it starts slowly showing the dreary lives of the two housewives who decide to rent a castle in italy for the month of april but do n't give up on it
nothing much happens but the time passes exquisitely and there are numerous sly jokes
the movie is wonderfully romantic in many senses of the word the scenery is beautiful and the resolutions in the movie are very satisfyingbr br the movie takes a couple of liberties with the book the biggest being with the arbuthnotbriggsdester business but i actually preferred the movie 's version of this br br an excellent movie especially as a date movie during lousy weather
i only watched this because it starred josie lawrence who i knewbr br from whose line is it anyway the wacky british improvisationalbr br comedy show
i was very pleasantly surprised by this heartwarming and magical gem
it is uplifting touching andbr br romantic without being sappy or sentimental
the characters arebr br all real people with real foibles fears and needs
see it
this is one of those rare movies it 's lovely and compelling dignified and quirky a true gift
i consider it a prerequisite for any trip to italy or any vacation at all because it reminds you to open yourself up to a broader experience
i especially loved josie lawrence as lottie wilkins but every lead and supporting actor is flawless in this film
further the costumes if you 're drawn to fashion and costumes are extraordinarily well done
i just wish they 'd release it on dvd because i'm wearing my tape version out
br br absolutely well worth your time just make sure to settle in to watch it without any interruptions
nice character development in a pretty cool milieu
being a male i'm probably not qualified to totally understand it but they do a nice job of establishing the restrictive victorian environment from the start
it is n't as bleak as it really was and the treatment of women was probably even harsher
what makes this go is a wonderful chemistry among the principal characters
each has their own thing that they contend with
once they come out of the rain and break out of the spider webs they begin to interact and slowly lose their sense of suspicion
what i enjoyed about this movie is that it did n't go for cheap comedy when it could have
it did n't try to pound a lesson into us
the people who seem utterly without merit are really nicely developed human beings who get to see the light
i did have a little trouble with the alfred molina character having such an epiphany so quickly but within this world it needed to happen
good acting all around with something positive taking place in the lives of some pretty good people
two thirds of nearly 2000 imdb users who have voted on this film have rated it at 8 9 or 10 and one user reports wearing out six videotapes
although the film is primarily intended as a period piece it clearly has a quite unusual fascination
but for some reason i imagined it as largely whimsy and until recently never felt the urge to watch it
my mind was changed by elizbeth von arnim 's original book
my wife loves reading but her sight no longer allows her to read much so she borrowed it in talking book form
such books are usually irritating to a companion who is busy with other things but i gradually came to appreciate that this one was seductively soothing although in no way syrupy and was also very well written
i realised my wife would enjoy watching the film and so decided to buy her the videotape
i am now very glad that i did and would certainly recommend its purchase to anyone else who appreciates a quiet reflective work with no fireworks but with well constructed character development and a very successful premussolini italian atmosphere
the story is set in the immediate post ww1 period and starts with two married london ladies who decide to pool their savings and enjoy a holiday together away from their families in a rented villa in italy
force of circumstances lead to this couple being joined by two others with very different characters and backgrounds
its theme is essentially no more than the interactions that take place as their holiday progresses not only between these four very disparate mature ladies but also with the occasional male visitor
if you want action thrills dramatic sex scenes natural or manmade disasters or harlequin style romances this would not be the film for you
but imdb users have collectively and very emphatically demonstrated that none of these are necessary for a film to prove highly rewarding to watch and if you care to give it a try you may as i did come to rank it among your much loved filmsbr br it is fairly rare for me to watch a film of a book with which i am already familiar
in many cases i find this takes some of the pleasure away from watching the film but here there is such a strong visual appeal in the setting that i actually found my pleasure augmented by the anticipation of seeing the next segment of the book effectively unrolled before my eyes
generally films of books tend to increase the dramatic level of the original work to ensure that the filmed version has an even wider appeal but here if anything it is reduced in order to keep the viewers attention on the gradual character development rather than on any background events
this works very well although changes from the book are few and basically the film remains true to the original story
great credit is due to the director mike newell and all members of the cast particularly those well known british actresses who play the four principal ladies
i absolutely loved this movie
i am not even sure what particularly about it but i think it was wonderful and should be available for dvd
the women were strangers and yet got along well enough to spend the time they did in the villa in italy
the actors in my opinion did an excellent job
the characters were all so different and yet clever story that made it work
there is humor drama and relationship issues all in good time
this requires 10 lines but i just ca n't think of any more to say so i will just rattle on until i get 10 lines
so sorry about this
what else can i possibly say it has been a long time since i last saw it
i am looking forward to view again but it is n't available
enchanted april is a tone poem an impressionist painting a masterpiece of conveying a message with few words
it has been one of my 10 favorite films since it came out
i continue to wait albeit less patiently for the film to come out in dvd format
apparently i am not alonebr br if parent company amazon 's listings are correct there are many people who want this title in dvd format
many people want to go to italy with this cast and this script
many people want to keep a permanent copy of this film in their libraries
the cast is spectacular the cinematography and direction impeccable
the film is a definite keeper
many have already asked
please add our names to the list
from rainy dreary late winter england of early 1920s br br where there is still sadness and many young widows and disabled vets from the great slaughter of men and killer of their womens' dreams known now as world war i br br four women share this lovely small sunny italian castle on a hill one a young widow who is drowning her sorrow in frantic partying two women who will rediscover their own husbands and a fourth woman who is tired of her famous dead friends br br these four women will come together with two husbands and a former soldier almost blind to get a spiritual makeover for one great april vacation in early 1920 's italybr br note to wouldbe filmmakers
study this film for how mood and beauty can tell a story
br br note stock up on coffee hot chocolate and invite the girls over on some dreary late winter day spring is coming enchanted april promises you
the true measure of any fictional piece of work is whether or not the characters grow from their experiences and emerge from the experience altered in some significant way at the endbr br by that measure enchanted april is a resounding success
as a film in general it succeeds quite wellexcellent ensemble cast welldeveloped characters you come to care about wonderful script and beautiful sets and locations
in short the film is well enchanting
although all the performances are firstrate three must be mentionedjosie lawrence jim broadbent and joan plowright
it says something when miranda richardson does her usual fine work and yet is overshadowed by so many others in the cast
most highly recommended particularly if you are a romantic at heart
further deponent saith not
my alltime favorite movie
oscarcaliber work by everyone involved both in front of and behind the camera
the screenplay is perfect and works out the relationship between lady caroline and george briggs in a completely satisfying way unlike the novel
the care with which the other leading characters have been drawn is a tribute to screen writer peter barnes and the intense visual beauty should have won oscars for director mike newell and cinematographer rex maidment
it is josie lawrence 's best work by far and transformed my opinion of joan plowright
having watched this movie at least 50 times i can find no fault in it
the music by famed composer richard rodney bennet is a marvel
this is an exquisite film about the search for some bliss in everyday life
the pacing the camera work the emotion the haunting musical score and the pure charm of this picture make it a must see
it is n't easily appreciated by the immature or emotionally stunted
the only flaw i can see about this film is that it was n't captured in a more technically perfect film format
it deserved toddao technicolor and the very finest sound format available
the gorgeous italian villas effect on its inhabitants would have rendered even more lushly and the small lovely moments would be even more beautifully seen and heard
as it is it still demands attention as a sweet moving small film
i ca n't stop myself from watching it every time it comes on satelite
the transformations of the characters from contained tight and mistrustful is always a joy to watch and i really should recommend it more oftenbr br the casting is perfect the mood is perfect the acting is above reproach
it is a film about middle age and the choices people makeit is deep and thoughtful without beating the viewer up with heavy handedness
watch it in one sitting and let it have its effect on you
if you do n't get it perhaps you have n't lived enough or something else is wrong with you
this is what i call a growth movie
every character is different and better at the end and it 's all because one woman knows that the place they have chosen is a tub of love
josie lawrence who is best known as a comedienne really shines as the woman who brings about all these changes
even the men in this film go from being selfcentered to better men
the book stayed very true to the novel which is a plus in my book since i am a librarian
the scenery breathtaking and the message of love genuine
i first saw this movie back in the early '90 's when it was first released
room with a view was also newly out
enchanted april had so much more to offer
i found it much more real and earthy the characters more believable for being 'normal'
by the end of the film i felt the same as i did when i first saw the bbc production of pride and prejudice i was yearning for the characters to find what they were looking for whether it was isolation peace liberty or love
you get a sense throughout that italy is so far removed from everything they have ever known that they are so decadent for taking a risk and leaving behind all that is humdrum and constricting
but in the heat of the spring in april everyone 's lives loosen and unravel and are slowly rebuilt to everyone 's satisfaction
what a little gem of a film
how come it is n't more well known
this is the kind of movie england can do in its sleep and that 's meaning it as a compliment
because of the success of very british comedies of manners situated at the end or beginning of the twentieth century most notably adaptations of e m forster novels this very merchantivory like production was received in the light it brought when it was released in 1992 it was an exceptional year for actress miranda richardson having appeared as the wife of jeremy irons who discovers her husband has been having an affair in the worst possible way in damage and as the ira terrorist who eventually dons a wig and gets a nasty comeuppance in the crying game
here she plays a quiet serene type of woman in rose arbuthnot one who with josie lawrence who plays lottie wilkins embarks on a trip that is filled with selfdiscovery
they are joined by an unlikely pair of ladies one caroline dester played by the enigmatic polly walker who resembles a very vamp louise brooks and mrs fisher
this foursome will eventually merge together into becoming deep friends only because the story is so filled with spring and an overwhelming dreamy sweetness it almost preordains it but this is fine it 's the movie it wants to be
alfred molina and jim broadbent fill out the cast as the husbands of the two main characters and all in all mike newell makes with his movie a living thing of nearmagical elements full of quiet moments and wonder
i first saw enchanted april about five years ago
i loved it so much that my husband surprised me with a copy the following christmas
it 's about two women who decide to rent a castle in italy for the month of april leaving their humdrum lives behind them
they are very sad women at the outset of the film and you ca n't help but root them on as they plan this getaway with two other women they invite along to share the expenses
this is perhaps the most feel good movie i have ever seen
it' pure and simple with no car chases no animosities and no deaths
it was made with care and in very good taste
you cannot help but smile all through it except when you 're crying happy tears
one of my all time favourite films ever
just beautiful full of human emotion wit humour intelligence
the story grows as does the lesson of life just a wonderful film in so many waysbr br the cast are also fantasic a great selection of the finest british talent around
i loved them all for every diverse element brought into the filmbr br italy has to be one of the most romantic places to form a story such as this everything about this film worksbr br i love it
this is one of the best movies
it is one of my favorites
a movie with good acting
the story is very sensitive and touching
good camera work alsobr br the names of the actresses and actors are not at the top of the american star list
however they give equal or better performances than the top of the listbr br it is such a pleasure to see a movie about true love romance friendship without having to endure watching someone having to kickbox their way to save the worldbr br if you do n't like this movie then you have no heart or feelings
then go watch a sports movie
there is no killing or horror here
see the movie
it is a must
th
i think this movie is absolutely beautiful
and i'm not referring only to the breathtaking scenery
it 's about two unhappy english housewives who decide to rent an italian castle to take a break from their not so happy home lives
in the end four women total rent the place together all with different personalities and different reasons for being there
in this magically beautiful place they all find the peace they 're longing for and interestingly that peace comes from inward reflections and resolutions more so than without
i also find it wonderful because of the relationships that are developed out kindness and understanding
the acting is a joy to watch in itself
i especially love the characters of lottie and lady caroline
for anyone who 's judged others at first meeting here is the perfect tutorial on depth of character
the grumpy old lady has a soft thoughtful heart and needs new friends
the flighty unsure 'ditsy' dame who makes inappropriate uncomfortable comments sees deep into your soul and has pure love for all
the cold prim proper neglected wife has passion simmering that could boil over at any minute given the right setting
the perfect beauty rich sweet partying pursued by throngs wants peace quiet and love without possessiveness
br br by taking the time to look beyond the surface you will find treasures in everyday life from the least expected sources
all it takes is patience and a touch of enchantment
i'm biased towards any movie that paints a luxuriant picture of italy in my opinion the most romantic country in the world
unfortunately the movie was rather short unusually so for a period piece and a little sparse on the cinematography aspect
however the excellent story makes up for it
the four ladies embark on a muchneeded relaxing vacation with problems on their minds
over the course of the movie they realize their problems and begin fixing them
they believe san salvatore the castle they stay in has an enchanting effect on people
it 's a tub of love says lottie wilkins
you can watch their gradual change from dissatisfied to exuberant as the italian seaside works its magic on thembr br all their problems and their solutions are plausible
the actresses were great
the background music seemed very appropriate for an romantic italian locale
all in all a 1010 movie for me
if anyone is wondering why no one makes movies like they used to with conversation character and a simple theme of friendship struggling to evolve into something new better and different those folks need to take in this film and see top notch writing directing and acting that melds into a wonderful evening of observation on how things used to be in italy and england
other days other times funneled into a terrific comedy of entertainment made in 1992 with alfred molina joan plowright polly walker josie lawrence jim broadbent miranda richardson and michael kitchens in the major roles
under the brush stroke direction of mike newell these actors accomplish vividly memorable performances that are photographed with a sublimely subtle painter 's eye
reminiscent of the theatrical bedroom farce of the turn of the century this film might be called a friendship farce that becomes a worthwhile experience in the growth of the romantic nature within each character and the viewer too
an artistic telegram on the importance of caring about those around us
my child my sister dream br br how sweet all things would seem br br were we in that kind land to live together br br and there love slow and long br br there love and die among br br those scenes that image you that sumptuous weather
br br charles baudelaire br br based on the novel by elizabeth von arnim enachanted april can be described in one sentence it takes place in the early 1920s when four london women four strangers decide to rent a castle in italy for the month of april
it is the correct description but it will not prepare you for the fact that enchanted april an ultimate feel good movie is perfection of its genre
lovely and sunny tender and peaceful kind and magical it is like a ray of sun on your face during springtime when you want to close your eyes and smile and stop this moment of serene happiness and cherish it forever
this is the movie that actually affected my life
i watched it during the difficult times when i was lost unhappy and very lonely when i had to deal with the sad and tragic events and to come to terms with some unflattering truth about myself
it helped me to regain my optimism and hope that anything could be changed and anything is possible
i had promised to myself then that no matter what i would pull myself out of misery and selfpity and i would appreciate every minute of life with its joy and its sadness i promised myself that i would go to italy and later that year i did and i was not alonebr br charming enchanting and heartwarming enchanted april is one of the best movies ever made and my eternal love
this little film is a diamond of highest quality
i always tell people that enchanted april is an adult movie with no cussing no sex and no violence
one might think of it as the ultimate chick flick but i bet there are one or two enlightened men out there who love it too
do n't invite the kids though
this movie is very lowkeybr br seeing enchanted april is a very healing experience
the sound track and gorgeous scenery along with the ladies' gentle manners bring to mind the peace and beauty of a preraphaelite paintingbr br lest anyone think yours truly only watches one kind of movie i will paraphrase a line i heard once on saturday night live and say that my two favorite movies are the deer hunter and enchanted april
had a bad day
dog bit the mailman
car would n't start
people got on your nerves
then refresh yourself with a delightful experiencebr br two women decide to pool their resources in answer to an ad for a month 's rental of a villa in italy
due to financial circumstances two other women join them
two have humdrum marital lives one is an elderly woman who prefers to live in the past the fourth is a wealthy and beautiful woman wholly jaded by lifebr br as the spell of the villa permeates their spirits each grows in her own way and is uplifted in her outlook
this also changes the people in their lives who have visited them
as they leave you know the magic of the villa will remain with them and you will find your outlook altered for the better
a delightfully uplifting movie
magic is n't too strong a word for the spell this film weaves
you find yourself relaxing and seeing others in a more benevolent light any movie that has that civilizing an effect on viewers deserves serious attention
seldom are we soaked in beauty like this
as if that were n't enough it 's funny
performances are without exception extraordinary but special mention must be made of the miraculous miranda richardson and the superb josie walker both open like rosesbr br why is n't this film on dvd
it deserves to live forever
this is a lovely spiritrestoring movie
from the use of the actual villa that inspired elizabeth arngrim to write the novel in the 1920s to the inspired casting every choice was perfectly right
the quiet joy of this film does n't stale after repeated viewings
josie lawrence miranda richardson polly walker and joan plowright seem to have been born to play these parts
i would dearly love to see enchanted april released on dvd in a widescreen format
this program is a lot of fun and the title song is so catchy i ca n't get it out of my head
i find as i get older i am drawn to the wrinklies who get things done and these four are excellent in their endeavors
some of what they do is outrageous but brilliant considering that now days with our pc world we 'd never be able to do it in real life
i always learn something from the shows
but if you like mystery drama comedy and a little forensic work you 'll love this show
it reminds me of quincy me in one way and barney miller in another the way they work and interreact with each other
they screw up a lot but they get the job done and that 's what counts
my wife kate and i absolutely loved the series and ca n't wait for the next one
i would love to know what the catchy song is called and who wrote it maybe because i am old and grey and still interested in life
if anyone has the full lyrics please send thembr br of course one big reason why my wife and i liked this series so much was that we are 75 years old and retired but still very active intellectually
it 's great to see a show that highlights the contribution to society that can still be made by older people with special skills and experience
the human interest aspect showing the interactions of the characters and the younger people around them is an important part of the showbr br this series is highly entertaining and very sophisticated on a par with some of our other favourites spooks and hustle
this is the best series of its type i 've seen all year
i ca n't help thinking it 's just my luck a series i love gets 6 episodes and the constant stream of cookiecutter cop shows get never ending episodesbr br i think the reasons new tricks succeeds are many
the scripts are good and the mix of characters superb the acting is top flight and the blend of comedy and drama works a treat
the stories are n't all that memorable but that 's not the reason i watch shows like this one
br br the theme song is a favourite and we were disappointed to find it is n't available in any published edition
great stuff bbc a triumph of sense over sexappeal
this is a wonderful new crime series bringing together three old stalwarts of british television as retired detectives brought back to help clear up old cases under the leadership of younger careerfocused amanda redman
the three quirky irritable old cops make a brilliant team applying twentyyear old detection methods in a police force which has moved a long way on since then sometimes with effect at other times to the horror of their senior officers
the three are portrayed sympathetically warts and all
there are splendid comic scenes and some very moving ones as each of the three has to come to terms with growing old and the legacy of their pastsbr br at the end of the first sixpart series each of the characters had developed
widower james bolam cannot come to terms with his wife 's untimely death
lothario denis waterman is learning to accept his role as grandfather
and even obsessive alun armstrong is helped by his new friends to fight the demons of his past and keep taking the medication
while amanda redman has to face the alltoofamiliar conflict between having a life and a career
the story lines have been interesting if rather heavily dependent on the wonders of dnatesting
but it is the interplay of four of britain 's finest actors which has made the series unmissable
being that this movie has a lot of fine entertainment qualities i think it should some more credit than it has been given on imdbbr br it 's your basic 'who done it'
thriller with sex and murder but it keeps you guessing right to the end
i like these kinds of movies and i certainly think this one meets the standardbr br to me it was worth watching more than once so i 'll give it an 8 on imdb
the luzhin defence is in the foreground a story of an idiosyncratic chess savant who becomes consumed by the game and in the background via flashbacks his boyhood life and the forces which created the man he has become
factor in good and evil in the forms of his his love interest and former mentor respectively and you have a plaintive drama laced with poignant and delicately humorous moments mingled with the rich scenic beauty of italy 's lake como and the intensity of high chess play
an excellent film for those into period dramas the auteur 's euphemistic chess play metaphor for orgasmic delight is an indication of the subtle wit behind the film
of course the plot script and especially casting are strong in the film
so many fine things to see
one aspect i liked especially is the idea of the antagonistluzhini 's exmentor working his evil on the sidelines
his chess opponentan italian dandy in three piece and caneturns out to be a real gent and a truly fine chess player
to his credit the opponent nobly goes along with the plan at the end to complete the final game for the championship posthumously by way of the unstable genius' widow in death then because of the gallantry of an honorable chess master luzhin 's defence is allowed to be played
the italian gent commends the play and calls it brilliant
talk about a dramatic end game
i fell in love with emily watson in breaking the waves then grew even more fascinated by her range and adeptness in hilary and jackie
now comes this stunning portrayal of a rich girl who spurns breeding and convention in favor of mothering the tortured soul of the child of a man clearly in need of mothering
her eyes are the mirror to his soul and what gentle and beautiful eyes they arebr br those who take things literally will find marleen gorris' poetic and allegorical direction quite frustrating
romantics who are willing to go with the amazing kinetic energy is this filmed allegorical poem will be well rewarded
marlene gorris has established herself as one of the world 's great directors
this sensitive visually beautiful film is based on a story by vladimir nabokov and captures well that writer 's dark irony
john turturro gives what i consider to be his finest performance and emily watson is brilliant as well
well worth seeing
this was an exteremely good historical drama
john turturro is excellent as the tortured genius luzhin and brilliantly portrays the character 's manic affectations such as his strange dancing
emily watson is fine in her support role as the sensitive lover nataliabr br the relatonship between chess and near madness is well explored by gorris and familiar nabokov preoccupations such as 'eternal innocence' are evident in this film
i think i will now go on to read the novel
it was a touching and tragic ending and it was hard to keep a dry eye
brilliant movie
this film is one of the few quality films of 2000 and definitely one of my best
the scenario is based on the novel by vladimir nabokov and the transfer to the big screen is absolutely brilliant
br br the photography of the film is excellent as is the acting of both turturro and watson
turturro definitely gives his best performance to date proving he 's worth much more than what we thought
watson also performs brilliantlybr br the story is about a phenomenal chess player which is also extremely eccentric in his everyday life
the film is presented in a non linear time with multiple flashbacks of luzhin 's childhood
through those the complex character of luzhin is described
br br i have nothing more to say but to suggest this film to anyone
the literary genius of vladimir navokov is brought to the screen again and many in the cultured world will take notice
the director puts us in check mate with the story of alexander an absentminded chaplinesque study of chess addiction
nastasya is vacationing in a marble columned resort where a chess championship is being hosted
she meets alexander by picking up a queen piece he drops thru his coat pocket
a magnetic attraction evolves whereby he proposes the next day the mother alarmed telegrams the husband
he arrives and questioning alexander we get these fades to the past ala' godfather ii where we see young alexander a child prodigy
he is taken under a school teachers wing and exploits his genius for 10 yrs making vast sums
thinking alexander reached his peak abandons him but becomes legend
the old teacher returns causing harm trying to give victory to an old rival of alexander
in a serious chess game where world chess champion victory is one way to immortality the chess clock ticks match time ends to conclude the next day
that day is nastasya 's wedding the old teacher interferes and alexander is sent on a nervous breakdown
nastasya holding her stomach and looking thru her love 's coat finds his strategy for the match and follows the moves
though the film unfortunately sways from its russian roots its low back cut dresses are lovely alexander plays his role sublimelythe director underestimated her audience we hardly ever get to play and the only hint of the luzhin defense is after trading queens isolate the opponents king with your 3 paws king sacrificing the castle for mate
nastasya is a great match but feel its conclusion deserved more intensity but maybe the emotions were right on check for chess meant more to him than her
the luzhin defense elegantly gives navokov honor the complexity of his work in images is a world event not to be missed
the storyline was rather interesting but the characters were rather flat and at times too extreme in their thoughtsbehavior
more extreme than necessary
also i think something went wrong in the casting
john turtorro does n't really satisfy me playing a semiautistic chess player not to speak of the italian player
motives were n't very much outlined eitherbr br
as a psychiatrist specialized in trauma i find this film a beautiful shown example of a severe psychic trauma even a trauma
it not only explains the enormous difficulties those people have to cope wither but that even love is sometimes not enough
but she tries
this movie stars emily watson of breaking the waves fame
this movie about one man 's obsession takes place at a resort where a chess tournament is being held
a chess master arrives and shortly after falls madly in love with a woman played by emily watson
she falls for this oddball of a man who is obsessed with chess
this is all at the dismay of her mother who is far more interested in seeing her with another young gentleman a proper gentleman
her mother feels that this is just a passing fancy for the young woman as she has a tendency to take in odd animals and such
what ensues is mostly a journey through the man 's psyche
it tells the story of how his past is closely tied with his present
emily watson is amazing in this as well as the actor who plays the main character
it is definitely slow but is well worth the watching
the ending was even satisfying
this movie was well done in all respects
the acting is superb along with the fine audio soundtrack which i purchased because it was so moving
it is my all time favorite movie ahead of eastwoods white hunterblack heart
this movie is simply the bestbr br cheers zuf
do n't know how this missed award nominations
great film
certainly of the calibre of beautiful mind great acting photography script and drama
i ca n't imagine anyone not being entranced by this film
not having read nabokov and knowing nothing about chess i could only view the luzhin defence as a movie
br br it works really well as one of my favorite genres sports romances
the chess comes alive as a tough competition much more than in say searching for bobby fischer in showing just how much hard mental work the game can be requiring thought preparation stamina and planning
i particularly liked the special effects on the chess board as alternative plays are anticipatedbr br through the feminist director maureen gorris emily watson with her big blue eyes gradually strengthens via her transformative relationship with john turturro 's fairly onenote absentminded intense chess geniusbr br the settings in italy and hungary are beautifulbr br
once again proving his amazing versatility john turturro plays the introspective russian chess genius preparing for a comeback tournament and forging an unlikely relationship with a gadabout fellow resident at a 1920 's italian hotel
they fall in loveto the horror of her socialmountaineering mother a wonderful love story whose gloss of chess might make it appear cerebralbut in spite of its origins in a nabakov story it certainly is not the romantic elements and the sense of time and place beat the psychological analysis hands downjohn turturro having appeared in barton fink o brotherwhere art thou
the big lebowski proves that he is not dependant on coen bros films to assert his stature
a brilliant chess player attends a tournament and falls in love with a woman he meets there
on itself this would be a pretty bad angle on a story
so there is more
there is the fact that the chess player is also completely alienated from the world because of his brilliance at the game and the fact there is some history haunting the playerbr br this film steps back and forth from romantic frivolity to tournament tension to historic events that shaped the chess player and works quite nicely
it 's easy to grow attached to the two main characters and easy to believe they might hit it off together like the way they do in this film
the added effect of the tournament is very good too and creates a nice tension settingbr br i have no idea of the strength of the chess players as i do n't play the game myself but it looks nice and believable
all in all most of the film goes down very easily
it is also forgotten again very easily though
so it 's nice to watch but nothing more than thatbr br 7 out of 10 chess players caught between a rook and a hard place
hi all i am a chess enthusiast since the age of about 6 i supposed i am quite obsessed by chess but hopefully not as much as the central character in this filmbr br in this film the central character reflects a real chess player called curt von bardeleben who committed suicide in 1924 he is famous for a game he played against steinitz where a beautiful combination was played by steinitz
instead of resigning he simply walked out of the tournament hall never to returnbr br the social ineptness of the central character is unfortunately a treat of some of the more serious grandmasters you sometimes get in chess tournaments
chess i suppose is a very big sacrifice and you can sometimes end up imbalanced in other areas of life
a major example of this is the chess legend bobby fischer
although a genius he was also very disturbed in many waysbr br in the film a world championship match is depicted as between an italian grandmaster and luzhin
the format is a knockout which actually the world governing body of fide has sometimes employed as a format itself going from 128 players to just 2 in the final
but this was a group knockout which also depicts a realistic format where the winners of each group play against each otherbr br the position before adjournment makes for a fascinating chess puzzle in itself
in fact i have done a youtube video about it for you to explore the winning combination in detail enjoy
best wishes tryfon
i'm rather surprised that no reviewer so far has commented on the rather elementary chess blunder in luzhin 's game as white against an unnamed opponent immediately before the final
despite the use of jonathan speelman as consultant chess expert luzhin is shown winning the game with an illegal move
in between the rapid cuts away and back to the board it is not hard to spot that after luzhin 's combination culminating in a queen sacrifice his rook on d1 is still pinned by black 's rook at c1 against his king in the corner at h1
thus he is unable to play the purported mating move rd1d8 which would be illegal but he 's shown doing so to rapturous applause from the audience
emily watson 's natalia is absolutely the most loving and romantic lead character i have ever seen on a screen
she is the queen of this film beyond all doubt
or is she transmuted to the king
the internecine weaving of the chess games and the families' struggles for control power and victory is stunning
just as the chess masters in the film do the director is playing many simultaneous games with our mind at once but all weave into either major or minor patterns
the period the costumes and imagery of early 20th century italy 's lake district is captured magnificently
not a single square of space is wastedbr br so many brilliant scenes abound i cannot recount them all
i recommend budgeting enough time to watch this movie twice possibly a week apart because you ca n't possibly capture all the poetry within a 64square yet multidimensional framework in one setting
br br i did not read nabakov 's book but to try an analogy of my own what i am reading reminds of me of another romantically triumphant poetryasgame movie barry levinson 's the natural
it totally jettisoned the downbeat ending of bernard malamud 's fatalistic book in favor of a romantic impressionism that was uniquely american
well the director did that one better by seamlessly meshing russian and italian morals and mores as a backdrop to enlightenment
the true story here is that games are zerosum there is a winner and a loser unless both contestants draw
but in life and especially in the context of our immortal souls we are only limited by those constraints and life 's conventions to the extent we let others break our spirit
br br pure love as personified by emily watson 's natalia can transcend and allow all of us to be enhanced by its gifts simultaneously
only the barriers erected by our fears can cut us off from itbr br this is a magnificent movie
the primary aspect of this film which most people miss is that luhzin lives his life as a chess game
so many people have seen this film and just do n't get it and i do n't understand why
while watching this film i was taken on a private journey which floored me
i will try to explain this without any spoilers but be forewarned i do talk about things that happen in the moviebr br possible spoilers be forewarned
br br his is a life of large moves versus small moves
he chooses natalia to be his queen and he and she behave as his aunt first described the king and queen and their moves when she introduced him to chess as a boy
listen closely to that descriptionbr br when someone asks him a question he flashbacks to the past as if reviewing past moves
the flashbacks are quite interesting as well for they give not only his point of view as a child but the point of view of the other character as well
it 's stunningbr br various characters become either his helpers or his enemies pawns bishops and knights their actions enlightening you as to who 's side they are on
even their placement in a scene is pivotal to understanding what is going on
beautifully donebr br i will not comment more on what happens to the character of luhzin but i hope that this will illuminate what is actually happening at the endbr br this film is constantly working on many levels which is why i endorse it
it was a treat and a joy to watchbr br if you like this film i would recommend a film called fresh
the only way that these films are similar is the use of chess and the characters being treated as piecesbr br
this is one of the unusual cases in which a movie and the novel on which it is based are both great
maybe this is because gorris' takes nabokov 's initial ideas and gives them a different interpretation
the final consequence is a point of view over luzhin which dignifies him more than the nabokov 's onebr br the only thing in the movie which i do n't like is the influence of valentinov 's on luzhin 's destiny
i ca n't imagine nabokov creating a person like valentinov and giving him so great influence on novel 's argument
this is a poem on film wonderfully presented and photographed with sensitive artistry
it captures the atmosphere of the time and place perfectly
it 's a love story with a twist
the characters are unique and believable
the settings are deliciously exotic
some of the scenes the funeral boat in the fog the high long shot of the chess table in the centre of an intricately patterned tile floor are beautiful images
and rather than the mandatory happy ending this story has a bitter sweet one
if film is an art this is close to a masterpiecebr br
very few chess movies have been made over the last couple of years but this one is more than just a chess movie its a story about the need to be loved and the need to win itjohn toturro plays a psychologically challenged man nothing matters to him accept 64 squares and 32 pieces the game validates him as a person when he looses a game he looses the one thing that makes sense to him and john torturro expresses this in a beautiful fashioneven the love of a woman was not enough to save him from his sad existenceit makes you wonder if there other luzon 's out there who obsess about the gamei am sure they areif you are a chess enthusiast it wo n't hurt to watch itits an intelligent piece of work laid out properly and executed wellit achieves its objectivesunfortunately i doubt if there will be sequel
alexandr sascha luzhin is a former leading chess player attempting a comeback at an italyhosted tournament
his brilliance is unquestioned but his obsession with chess has stunted his growth in all other aspects of his life
natalia is a beautiful heiress who has come to the same resort with her mother vera to scope out possible marriage partners
vera leans toward a handsome count but astonishingly natalia is more fascinated by sascha whom she met on a walk
sascha too is taken with natalia and proposes marriage at their second meeting
but with the concentration that sascha must give to the chess matches and with other happenings in his past still causing problems will he win the heart of natalia
oh and can he become the chess champion also
this is a lovely film based on a novel by nabokov
the acting is amazing with watson very fine as the beautiful little rich girl and turturro utter perfection as the shy awkward chess enthusiast
james gives quite a nice turn as the overbearing mother and the other cast members are wonderful as well
as for the look of the film it could not be better
the scenery is of the putyoureyeout variety the vintage costumes are gorgeous and the cinematography is deserving of much applause
yes the story is unusual and told with the use of flashbacks at times making it a film not everyone will appreciate
then too the ending is bittersweet
however if you love romance period pieces great acting knockout scenery or the fine art of motion picture creation do n't miss this one
you will be defenseless in resisting its multitude of charms
'the luzhin defence' is a good film with fine central performances but too much of the novel and not enough of the filmmaker 's craft shines through
it felt through most of the film that the characters just helped to push the narrative along
marlene gorris could perhaps have examined the psyche of luzhin rather than depicting him as a tortured innocent victim torn apart by the cruel motives of othersbr br adapting literature for the screen is clearly a difficult task especially a novel written in the early 20th century
this film does not go deeply enough into the relationship between luzhin and natalia
natalia 's rift with her mother comes across a churlish disagreement by the mother rather than a dramatic flashpoint in the film
i felt that i was put through luzhin 's torment and eventual tragic end without being given the pleasure of having his unusual and complex personality unravelled
however this was a moving and enjoyable film but certainly not a great one
'the luzhin defence' is a movie worthy of anyone 's time
it is a brooding intense film and kept my attention the entire time
john turturro is absolutely stunning in his portrayal of a tender eccentric chess grandmaster and emily watson is spellbinding as the gentle but rebellious daughter of a highly respected russian family
the chemistry between watson and turturro on screen is obvious from the moment their characters meet in the story
all in all this movie is one of the best indepth looks at the life of a chess grandmaster and turturro and watson add a whole nonmainstream noncliche feel to the film
most people will come out of the theater thinking and feeling somewhat touched by this brilliant look at the most unlikely of love stories
a movie of outstanding brilliance and a poignant and unusual love story the luzhin defence charts the intense attraction between an eccentric genius and a woman of beauty depth and characterbr br it gives john turturro what is probably his finest role to date similarly emily watson shows the wealth of her experience
to reach the tortured chess master her character has to display intelligence as well as a woman 's love
watson does not portray beautypageant sexuality but she brings to her parts a selfawareness that is alluringbr br in a chance meeting between natalia and luzhin she casually stops him from losing a chess piece that has fallen through a hole in his clothing a specially crafted piece that we realize later in the film has come to symbolize his hopes and aspirations
later as their love affair develops she subtly likens dancing to chess she encourages him to lead her with bold brilliant moves and in doing so enables him to relax sufficiently to later play at his best br br this is a story of a woman who inspires a man to his greatest achievement and in so doing finds her own deepest fulfillment emotionally and intellectually br br the italian sets are stunning
the complexity of the characters and the skill with which the dialogue unfolds them is a delight to the intelligent moviegoer yet the film is accessible enough to make it a popular mainstream hit and most deservedly so
chess is merely the photogenic backdrop for developing an emotional and emotive movie although the game is treated with enough respect to almost convince a chessplayer that the characters existed
although a tragedy of remarkable heights by a classic author the final denouement is nevertheless surprisingly uplifting
part of the enjoyment that i took from this film stemmed from the fact that i knew nothing more about it than that it starred john turturro and emily watson was a period piece and involved chess
everything that evolved before me was completely unexpected
i sha n't therefore give away much more
suffice to say that turturro is magnificent as an eccentric obsessive and deeply vulnerable chess genius and em matches him step for step as the strongminded woman who is drawn to him
it 's about love and obsession rather than the venerated board game and after drawing me in gradually over the first half hour became totally compelling
and i defy anyone to secondguess the ending
walking home after the film i was humming the familiar waltz music that natalia and alexandre were dancing to
i 've heard that before where
ah from kubrick 's eyes wide shut 'got it just as i arrived at the door
it 's waltz no
2 from jazz suite no
2 composed by dimitri shostakovich performed here by the city of prague philharmonic orchestra
yes i went and picked up the soundtrack from tower 's
what a treat
the film score by alexandre desplat was fulfilling there are fifteen tracks besides two tracks of the delightful waltz
it 's not often these days we get a soundtrack entirely dedicated to a comprehensive film score
reminds me of favorite scores by maurice jarre ennio morricone georges delerue and john barry
there are subtle nuances of strains and notes from the strings celeste piano and harp
br br emily watson and john turturro delivered a credibly consuming paired performance
the love story their intimate connection is very much between alexandre and natalia his childlike yet tormenting inner world and her generous and bold understanding of him a relationship alone to them both
director marleen gorris of antonia 's line gave us a quietly sensitive film not without its unsettling human conflicts intrigues obsessions family strives lovingness and respect
the frontend subject is the mindgame and mathematical logic of chess
beneath it can be a mild tearjerker of a drama set in the late 1920 's
cinematography captures the serene beauty of lake como in northern italy near the swiss borderbr br i highly recommend the soundtrack if you do n't feel like going to the movies
alexandre desplat 's lyrical film score of the luzhin defence is complete
obsession comes in many flavors and exists for a variety of reasons for some it may be nothing more than a compulsive disorder but for others it may be an avenue of survival
lack of nurturing combined with an inability to negotiate even the simplest necessities of daily life or the basic social requirements may compel even a genius to enthusiastically embrace that which provides a personal comfort zone
and in extreme cases the object of that satisfaction may become a manifested obsession driving that individual on until what began as a means of survival becomes the very impetus of his undoing and as we discover in the luzhin defence' directed by marleen gorris a high level of intelligence will not insure a satisfactory resolution to the problem and in fact may actually exacerbate the situation
obsession it seems has no prejudice or preference moreover it gives no quarterbr br at an italian resort in the 1920 's alexander luzhin is one of many who have gathered there for a chess tournament the winner of which will be the world champion
luzhin is a master of the game but he is vulnerable in that chess has long since ceased to be a game to him rather it is his obsession that one thing discovered in childhood that saw him though his total ineptness in seemingly all areas of life and enabled him to cope with the subtle disenfranchisements of his immediate family
so luzhin is a genius with an achilles heel a flaw which perhaps only one other person knows about and understands and furthermore realizes can be exploited for his own personal gain at this very tournament
that man is valentinov luzhin 's former mentor who after an absence of some years has suddenly reappeared and made himself known to luzhinbr br valentinov is an unwelcomed disconcerting presence to luzhin and once again life threatens to overwhelm him
not only is he about to face a formidable opponent in the tournament turati against whom in a previous match he emerged with a draw after fourteen hours but he is also attempting to resolve a new element in his life his feelings for a young woman he 's just met at the resort natalia
and genius though he may be dark clouds are gathering above him that just may push luzhin even deeper into the obsession that has been the saving grace as well the curse of his entire lifebr br to tell luzhin 's story gorris effectively uses flashbacks to gradually reveal the elements of his childhood that very quickly led to his obsession with chess
and as his background is established it affords the insights that allow the audience to more fully understand who luzhin is and how he got to this point in his life
for the scenes of his childhood gorris textures them with an appropriately dark atmosphere and a subtle sense of foreboding that carries on into and underlies the present more pastoral setting of the resort
the transitions through which she weaves the past together with the present are nicely handled and with the pace gorris sets it makes for a riveting yet unrushed presentation that works extremely well
she also underplays the menace produced by the presence of valentinov concentrating on the drama rather than the suspense which ultimately serves to heighten the overall impact of the film making luzhin 's tragedy all the more believable and unsettlingbr br the single element that makes this film so memorable however is the affecting performance of john turturro
for this film to work luzhin must be absolutely believable one false or feigned moment would be disastrous as it would take the viewer out of the story immediately
it does n't happen however and the film does work because the luzhin turturro creates is impeccably honest and truetolife
he captures luzhin 's genius as well as his inadequacies and presents his character in terms that are exceptionally telling and very real
it 's a performance equal to if not surpassing geoffrey rush 's portrayal of david helfgott in shine'
and when you compare his work here with other characters he 's created from sid lidz in unstrung heroes' to pete in o brother where art thou'
to al fountain in box of moonlight' you realize what an incredible range turturro has as an actor and what a remarkable artist he truly isbr br as natalia emily watson is excellent as well turning in a fairly reserved performance through which she develops and presents her character quite nicely
though she has to be somewhat outgoing to relate to luzhin watson manages to do it in an introspective way that is entirely effective
most importantly because of the detail she brings to her performance it makes her accelerated relationship with luzhin believable and lends total credibility to the story
you have but to look into watson 's eyes to know that the feelings she 's conveying are real
it 's a terrific bit of work from a talented and gifted actorbr br the supporting cast includes geraldine james christopher thompson peter blythe orla brady mark tandy kelly hunter alexander hunting and luigi petrucci
well crafted and delivered the luzhin defence' is an emotionally involving film presented with a restrained compassion that evokes a sense of sorrow and perhaps a reflection upon man 's inhumanity to man
we do n't need a movie of course to tell us that there is cruelty in the world but we are well served by the medium of the cinema when it reminds us of something we should never forget inasmuch as we all have the ability to effect positive change and to make a difference in the lives of those around us
i rate this one 910
br br br br br br
take 4 couples whose relationships were already on the rocks and put them on an island paradise where they 'll be tempted by 26 singles
this was the premise of the show simple yet outrageous funny
leave it to fox to throw morality out the window let the debauchery flow
it was like a reallife version of melrose place
the good thing about the show is that it was n't about people conniving manipulating each other for a cash prize
it was about lust temptation pure and simple the ultimate test for a relationshipbr br people either loved the show or hated it
it was kind of like slowing down to look at a horrific traffic accident
you know you should n't watch but you ca n't help but look
drama aside there was a lot of eye candy
let me first state that while i have viewed every episode of startrek at least twice i do not consider myself a trekker or trekkie
those are people who live in their parents basement and attend conventions wearing costumes with pointed rubber ears
i gave this movie a seven casting aside the fiction historical errors
the acting was better than average but the plot held no surprises
they tried very hard to reverse engineer the technology but still the special effects were just to great a temptation
now as to the historical errors if you call them that the first capitan to pilot the enterprise was commander april then capt
pike jim kirk etc according to a statement made by both riker and kirk we dicovered the klingons and educated them and gave them the technology but like i said these are no reason to discredit this fine series
i hope the plots will get deeper and then special effects can take a backseat
i have been a star trek fan for as long as i can remember
when they announced the planning and premiere of the fifth series i was very excitedbr br the premiere of enterprise was well worth the wait
it was well done with the perfect setting and a great acting job done by all the characters
the nx01 enterprise is the perfect vessel to show the beginnings of what many people have come to lovebr br scott bakula was just superior as captain jonathan archer
jolene blalock gave a commanding performance as subcommander t'pol
that it just two people of this wonderful new crew that is boldly going to take us into the great history of starfleetbr br enterprise looks like it 's going to be a good series well worth watching and i recommend that
watch it
this is the start of a new and interesting star trek series
it has a down to earthkind of feel with darker and less plaggy scenographybr br the characters need some more time to develop but they have potential
one thing that is fairly disappointing is that they portray such a gloomy picture of the equality between men and women in the future when they paint a very positive picture about everything else
br br the female characters here are two subcommander t'pol who is vulcan and communications officer hoshi who is human
hoshi is quite wimpy and t'pol is made to be a vulcan babebr br some of the crew attitudes feel a bit too american but creates interesting dynamicsbr br a very good pilot though for a very good series
br br there is star trek canon lots of it
from canon we know the history of the future
advances in technology events places first contacts with new beings names dates etcbr br enterprise pretty much disregards much of st canon
an unfortunate fact for long time serious fans
as one i assumed that the producers would at least take a look at the first few episodes of tos and retro back from there but nobr br the phase pistols like much of the technology look much more modern than found in tos
an old style starfleet laser gun a slow gold speckle transporter effect that 's what i expected to see
also i did not expect to hear pure beepbased sound effects similar to tng but far apart from tos sound effects
br br in the earliest view of tos we see a starfleet with a more formal military aspect a bit of old earth navy
with enterprise we see a shocking disregard for rank
there is more military code in the cartoon star blazers than in enterprisebr br it is fine that captain archer is unsure about the needs of the universe but inside enterprise everyone seems like an equal
unprofessional unsure more distant from the feel of formal military service than found in any st series and that says a lotbr br the casual country music opening theme song heralds the journeys of a family rather than the adventures of an important large military vesselbr br enterprise looks to show us a mostly fun warmfuzzy exploration of human relationships rather than take us on a historic bold gritty highrick exploration of spacebr br i would have selected adrian paul to play the captain and an older human to be the doctor
still i liked the actors for the most part
linda park an outstanding ballroom dancer from boston college is sure to develop nicely
the characters making up the crew seem to be thoughtfully createdbr br enterprise begins its run stronger than did the past three star trek series
let 's hope for a good future
enterprise is the entertainment but it is also the forefront of science fiction and a positive outlook for tomorrow
with gratitude and respect mr berman and mr braga
i wish you well thank you both for your service to trekbr br enterprise is what trek is about
call me adolescent but i really do think that this is a great series
if you have n't had a chance to experience a few episodes of the latest star trek series you should definitely watch this one
perhaps more compelling than that of voyager 's caretaker which launched the series with cpt
janeway archer 's adventures are completely different yet strangely familiar the music is catchy too
no true scifi fan can go without seeing at least one star trek episodeand these installments make the wait worthwhile
this is what i was expecting when star trek ds9 premiered
not to slight ds9
that was a wonderful show in it 's own right however it never really gave the fans more of what they wanted
enterprise is that show
while having a similarity to the original trek it differs enough to be original in it 's own ways
it makes the ideas of exploration exciting to us again
and that was one of the primary ingredients that made the original so loved
another ingredient to success was the relationships that evolved between the crew members
viewers really cared deeply for the crew
enterprise has much promise in this area as well
the chemistry between bakula and blalock seems very promising
while sexual tension in a show can often become a crutch i feel the tensions on enterprise can lead to much more and say alot more than is typical
i think when we deal with such grand scale characters of different races or species even we get some very interesting ideas and television
also we should note the performances blalock is very convincing as vulcan t'pol and bacula really has a whimsy and strength of character that delivers a great performance
the rest of the cast delivered good performances also
my only gripes are as follows
the theme
it 's good it 's different but a little to light hearted for my liking
we need something a little more grand
does n't have to be orchestral
maybe something with a little more electronic sound would suffice
and my one other complaint
they sell too many adds
they could fix this by selling less ads or making all shows two parters
otherwise we 'll end up seeing the shows final act getting wrapped up way too quickly as was one of my complaints of voyager
the pilot of enterprise has one thing that has been lacking since the original star trek a dose of realistic flawed personalities
the utopian characters of the next generation got tiring they were so noble as to be unbelievable
i also like the subplot that humans are bitter toward the vulcans
its funny seeing them as pretentious snobs
it makes me look forward to seeing when the humans become the dominant race between the two though i do n't think it would work in the time frame of the show
the only negatives that jumped out at me were the quick cut off the ending at 2 hours feel of the end which is common among many of the trek shows
the second was the shameless dig for ratings by a couple of senselessly sexy scenes
it was out of place a good science fiction show should be able to stand on its own without trying to pad the preteen audience with some skin
but its not my job to make the show profitable so oh wellbr br lets see how the next episode does
i like many diehard trekkers suffered through seven seasons of star trek voyager dreaming of a better show when it was over lamenting the end of deep space nine in 1999 prayers answered
enterprise is fantastic
fresh perspective radically different characters stunning new visuals a popsong for the intro
i ca n't think of anything i did n't like
sign me up for 10 seasons of this show
star trek is back voyager nobody misses you
keep on trekkin'br br
i think this has the potential of being the best star trek series yet i say potential we all know there is a chance they will drop the ball and run out of ideas but i hope not
for those that have not seen it see it
without that annoying prime directive floating over their heads every time they encounter races it could be cool and scott bakula was without a doubt a great choice for captain and the vulcan babe is hot too i gave this a full 10 it blows away all the other series openers i hope this goes longer than 7 years
ok so this is coming a few weeks late but it is here
mostly this is because of statements of various negative natures
starting with the technology
when star trek tos ran special effect technology was extreamely low tec and more than that the crew had little money to do any kind of proper mock ups
in the 35 years seince tos premiered the crew of star trek have become experts at economybr br ultimately they have decided quite rightly in my mind to abandon the look of tos and reverse engineered tng et all
so what if they decided not to make the transporter out of gold glitter or made the phase pistols look closer to the ones from star trek ii
as for the nits being picked about first contact with the klingon empire it was presumed based upon comments made by kirk and riker that earth only met the klingon 's in 2200 nothing was firmly establishedbr br enterprise gives us the most promising venue of exploration that we 've seen in a while
this is what voyager could have been
no series can evolve without a few inconsistancies but be thankful that star trek has so few
so quit gripping and enjoy
after 7 years of watching that dreadful nonsense called star trek voyager i was feeling pretty numb
next gen and ds9 were bloody good stuff and voyager ruined tv trek
this opened with probably the best pilot to a trek show
the crew were really good as were the choice of actors for the parts
scott bakula played a typical first time captain in deep space and his unpolished way of doing things was a refreshing change to the already know everything captains from before
the rest of the crew were really likable in their roles and i think they got off to a good first season
when the show was prematurely canceled i was really disappointed
in a mirror darkly showed us what the cast were capable of
pity a film or tv movie was never considered
so much back story and founding of the federation left to tell including the onset of hostilities with the klingons
okay the recent history of star trek has not been good
the next generation faded in its last few seasons ds9 boldly stayed where no one had stayed before and voyager started very bad and never really lived up to its promise
so when they announced a new star trek series i did not have high expectations
and the first episode broken bow did have some problems
but overall it was solid trek material and a good rompbr br i 'll get the nits out of the way first
the opening theme is dull and i do n't look forward to sitting through it regularly but that 's what remotes are for
what was really bad was the completely gratuitous lotion rubbing scene that just about drove my wife out of the room
they need to cut that nonsense outbr br but the plot was strong and moved along well
the characters though still new seem to be well rounded and not always what you would expect
the vulcans are clearly being presented very differently than before with a slightly ominous theme
i particularly liked the linguist who is the first star trek character to not be able to stand proud in the face of death but rather has to deal with her phobias and fears
they seemed to stay true to trek lore something that has been a significant problem in past series though they have plenty of time to bring us things like shooting through shields the instant invention of technology that can fix anything and the inevitable plethora of timetravel stories
anyone want to start a pool on how long before the borg show upbr br all in all the series has enormous potential
they are seeing the universe with fresh eyes
we have the chance to learn how things got the way they were in the later series
how did the klingons go from just insulting to war
how did we meet the romulans
how did the federation form and just who put earth in charge
why is the prime directive so important
if they address these things rather than spitting out time travel episodes this will be an interesting seriesbr br my favorite line zephram cochran saying where no man has gone before
a very good start
i was a bit surprised to find the machinery not quite so advanced it should have been cruder to match we saw in the original series
the cast is interesting although the vulkan lady comes across as a little too human
she needs to school on spock who after all is the model for this race
too bad they could n't have picked jeri ryan
i like ms park the koreanlady
the doctor has possibilities
have n't sorted out the other males except for the black guy
he 's a really likeable
bakula needs to find his nichein ql his strong point was his sense of humor and his willingness to try anything
he is of course big and strong enough for the heroics
the heavies were ok although i did n't like their makeup
a strong pilot this twohour episode does an excellent job of setting up the characters and background for enterprise the prequel to the original star trek series
it stumbles a few times into trek convention and clichcandycolored space strippers never seem to go out of style and i can already foresee snickering references to t'pol as seven of vulcanbut the ensemble looks strong the characters are welldrawn and one can already see hints that this particular crew will have to be more resourceful in different ways than those of earlier series
scott bakula hits the right note as a captain with kirk 's brashness and daring but without his smugness and swagger and i look forward to the ways in which the series will feature the engineer weapons master and communications officer as supporting players
the writers seem to have picked up on the one big mistake made in star trek the next generation deep space 9 and voyager instead of starting with a big ensemble cast and giving characters short shrift it 's starting with a smaller core of characters to which a little more variety can be added laterwhich i hope happens because after about a halfdozen episodes more variety will be needed
enterprise the latest high budget spinoff to the most successful franchise in film and or television history opens to the tune of a 90minute episode called 'broken bow'
first we are swept into a massive action sequence with a klingon being chased by some suliban
from there the televised movie takes us on a journey that seldom gets as good as it is with some of the best character development story and actionvisual effects ever seen in such a short amount of timebr br the openingcredits is a debatable subject among the minority of enterprise fans whom some believe that the song is out of place
what they fail to realise is the lyrics themselves
if one listens to the actual song instead of the theme then they will begin to piece the parts of the puzzle together
and eventually as the series progresses further and further and we learn more about our valiant captain and his crew will the song actually become meaningful
overall diane warren 's theme is beautifully orchestrated and is sung just as well by opera singer russell watsonbr br what makes any television show watchable and worth watching time and time again is its characters and the way they become structured and layered
enterprise is one of the most well cast shows since the next generation
choosing scott bakula as captain jonathan archer was the best decision since gene himself cast patrick stewart as jeanluc picard
as the captain always leads the show bakula adds a subtlety to his role and brings a huge smile to the faces of anyone with blood pumping in their veins
he simply is a superb human being and his charm wit and compassion are overwhelming to watch
as for the other cast members a favourite of mine is john billingsley who plays dr phlox
it 's also nice to see a nonhuman playing a role and the decision to give the captain a dog named 'porthos' was a wellreceived idea
throughout the show character development was brilliant it was fast well timed and almost perfect
i say almost because sadly travis mayweather 's character played by the briton anthony montgomery is a little weak at the end of the first season
he does have some things to say here and there but remains in the hands of the producers to make him more important
jolene blalock is wonderful as the sometimes harsh but equally loveable subcommander t'pol
dominic keating as lieutenant malcolm reed plays a strong role and is convincing as the armoury officer
connor trinneer plays commander charles trip tucker who always adds charm and comedic style to his character and finally linda park as ensign hoshi sato who often plays a weaker character but thankfully quickly becomes interesting
all of these characters make up enterprise and all bring a quality that star trek has n't seen in a long time
each person makes this show worth watching
smiles and feelgood senses are guaranteed right from the first time we see them all together on the bridge of the starship enterprise nx01br br the ship itself the nx01 is somewhat questionable in design
the series is set 150 years from now and 100 years before captain kirk
so why then does the ship appear to be similar in design to mid 24th century ships namely the akira class starship
continuity has been an issue in enterprise but thankfully rick and brannon offer suitable explanations for each and everyone of them
continuity is only a problem if you are forever scrutinising shows and are obsessed with the tiniest of details
if you see the show with and open mind then you 'll have no problems but there is an urge to know 'why' all the time
so what did berman and braga offer to the star trek fanbase with the issue of the deign of the ship itself
according to them the nx01 is how it is because of the incident in first contact
when zefram cochrane saw the enterprisee through his telescope and from speaking with the away team lead by commander riker it changed the ideas in his head
that 's a good enough explanation for melets move on
of course its not as easy for some fans to accept that sort of answer some go as far as to refuse to see the show until they get a reasonable answer
come on guys grow upwhen george lucas destroyed the star wars saga with the launch of his profit making new trilogy fans could n't do anything only watch and sap it all up anyway
and then they learned that well maybe its not that bad after all
if you ca n't accept a quality show for what it is not what it should be in your mind then go elsewhere
or try becoming a producer on the show and then see what you can dobr br the sets on enterprise remind me very much of the defiant from deep space nine
they often appear cold and have an eerie look of modern structure to them and they cry out that they belong to the military
perhaps that why the crew of the uss enterprise like it so much
they are striking sets and represent the show perfectlybr br rick berman 'the overlord of the empire' as john logan so accurately put it and his counterpart brannon braga has hit the nail on the head exactly where they should have and in all the right places
whether that be technicalities visuals sound editing or score
enterprise is a fine demonstration to just how good televised science fiction can ultimately be when in the hands of geniuses
the late gene roddenberry would be proud of this series and as a star trek fan so should you
in 2151 in broken bow oklahoma a farmer shoots the klingon klaang with his plasma rifle after the explosion of a methane store in his farm and the klingon is sent to the starfleet hospital
the vulcan ambassador soval proposes to unplug the life support system and bring the corpse of klaang to his warrior empire in planet kronos with honor
however captain jonathan archer proposes to go with the enterprise in her first voyage and bring back klaang alive to his home planet
jonathan invites ensign hoshi sato and dr phlox who is treating klaang to complete his crew and the vulcan subcommander t'pol is assigned to participate in the dangerous first mission of enterprise
when the equipment of the starship is shutdown klaang is kidnapped by sulibans after a shooting in the hospital
after the autopsy of the suliban killed in the shooting captain archer is informed by dr phlox that the alien was actually a mutant altered in a sophisticated genetic engineering process
t'pol modifies the sensors of the enterprise to track the suliban spacecraft until she reaches planet riger x they investigate and disclose that klaang was a courier bringing an important message about the temporal cold war from the suliban sarin to the leaders of the klingons in kronosbr br in spite of being a huge fan of star trek i have not followed the episodes of enterprise on cable television
i have decided to buy the dvd box of the first season and this first episode surprised me
the adventure of the first enterprise captain jonathan archer the gorgeous t'pol reed mayweather dr phlox hoshi and trip is excellent at least in this pilot
i have noted in imdb that this episode is actually divides in two parts but on dvd they are just one therefore my review is valid for both
i did not like the music score theme which i found very annoying but this was an exception in this great show
my vote is ninebr br title broken bow
broken bow takes us back to where it all began
set 150 years in our future and 100 years before kirk spock and mccoy
this installment of the star trek franchise is in my opinion the first series since tos to recapture the feelings of wonder danger and excitement of going where no man has gone before
scott bakula is perfectly cast as jonathan archer the first captain of the first star ship enterprise
he and the entire cast truly show a true reverence for the star trek legacy
john billingsley is brilliant as the alien dr phlox and jolene blalock is totally luscious as the tempting but logical vulcan science officer t'pol
broken bow is in my opinion the best premier episode of any of the treks and i believe gene roddenberry would surely be proud
i just watched this for the first time in a long time i had forgotten both how imaginative the images were and how witty the movie is
i had not forgotten however the opening scenes which are among the most romantic ever filmedbr br anyone interested in politics or history will love the movie 's offhand references anyone interested in romance will be moved by hunterniven and anyone who loves visual imagery will enjoy the depiction of the afterworldbr br my favorite movie remains odd man out made near the same time but this one is superb
br br
i first see this film almost 21 years ago when it was an itv matine
i was off school with the mumps and i was totally wrapped in the film
i have had it on bought video for about 10 years and i want to obtain a dvd copy of it
david niven is my all time favourite actor and i think it is a travesty that he was over looked so many times when the oscars came around
i also think that the queen should have knighted him as he easily did as much for the movie industry if not more than sean connery or anthony hopkins
the way the film switches from black and white to colour and back again is well done and the film has such stellar actors as roger livesy marius goring and an early appearance from richard attenborough
stairway to heaven is a outstanding invention of movie making probably never duplicated
i rank it with the wizard of oz and african queen although it is a totally different type of movie than african queen
stairway to heaven is a psychodrama that uses performance concepts and technical effects that to my knowledge are totally unique
br br for example there is the combination of bw and color footage as in oz but the significance of the contrast goes way beyond the simple but beautiful effect achieved in oz
in stairway the purpose and effect of the contrast can only be described as powerfulbr br another brilliant aspect of stairway is the concept of time and how it is used here
how could anybody have conceived of a better way to make time stand still literally
and then there is the stairway itselfbr br if you have any imagination at all you will agree with me
stairway to heaven is a true gem
br br filmed just after the war this story was made in order to highlight angloamerican relations after the war
it ended up receiving the honour of being the first royal premiere after wwiibr br remarkably the film tangles together the royal air force sigmund freud psychology the founding fathers of america and various others up the long stairs and beyond the heavenly gates without losing any of its integrity
br br although sounding absurd this clever script leads and dances the viewer between heaven and earth with the skill of a mountain goat and a presents a charming ease rarely matched in cinema since
br br be prepared to have your heart warmed by this sweet innocent and charming love story
roger livesey acts like a man possessed to steal the show
br br british cinema should cry when it remembers how good it used to be in those early post war yearsbr br
surely one of the best british films ever made if not one of the best films ever made anywhere
script cinematography direction and acting in a class on their own
this film works on so many levels
so why is it completely unavailable on tape dvd
never shown on tv
why is it hidden away when it is regularly shown at the national film theatre in london to packed houses
i remember the first time i saw this movie i was in the office working over the weekend the tv was on for background noise
but i gradually found myself more more engaged in this movie i 'd never seen or heard of until i was completely absorbed
a matter of life death is delightful compelling whimsical moving all in one superblywritten wellacted perfectlydirected package
it 's a classic that really does rank right up there with casablanca it 's a wonderful life gone with the wind citizen kane chariots of fire
why has it never received the same public notice videostore prominence
fortunately some knowledgeable critics have put it on their top 100 of all time lists
there is hope 1940 's fantasia was n't a hit 'til the '60s the wizard of oz was a dud at the box office but made a hit by tv
buy it rent it watch it demand it
you wo n't be disappointed
one of the few best films of all time
the change from black and white to colour for the heaven and earth sequences was directorial excellencebr br the plot is extremely clever the complete film leaves you overwhelmed by all of the human emotions and although a war film it does n't discriminate
i must have seen this film more times than any other and i never tire of it
it is a film that makes you question your own mortality and beliefs on what happens after our demise
pressburger and powell 's greatest movie
david niven plays the raf bomber pilot who misses his own death but is granted a second chance at life when heaven notices that he is awol and dispatches an angel to investigate
the scene when the young soldiers men and women black and white all killed in action arrive in heaven to be processed for eternal life is unbearably poignant
watch out too for roger livesey a deeply under appreciated actor and kim hunter as the love interest
incidentally steven spielberg cast the actress who played the chief angel as the elderly wife of the eponymous private in saving private ryan half a century later an act that speaks volumes for his cinematic literacy
also known as stairway to heaven in the us
during wwii british peter carter 's plane is shot down in combat but he survives
he meets and falls in love with lovely june
but it seems a mistake was made in heavenhe should have died
a french spirit comes to get him but he refuses
he is soon to plead his case in front of a heavenly tribunal that he should be allowed to livebr br sounds ridiculous but this is actually an incredible film
the script is good with the actors playing the roles completely straightfaced and it 's beautifully directedthe scenes on earth are in breathtaking technicolor and the scenes in heaven are in black and white
niven is a little stiff at times but hunter is just great and roger livesey is superb as a doctor trying to help niven
the imagery throughout is amazing and the special effects are truly great
there 's also a very strange sequence when niven runs into a totally nude young boy herding sheep
this is an absolutely beautiful thought provoking filmhighly recommended
this remains unknown in the us which is a shame
i first saw this movie about 20 years ago and have never forgotten it
it 's beautifully filmed and the story keeps one riveted for the entire time
it 's difficult to believe this was made in 1946 as the tale is still fresh today and really makes one think
i'm not very knowledgeable regarding film technique however the special effects in this film are terrific considering when this was made
in addition the acting is superb and the use of english and american actors quite astounding
i recently purchased the dvd so now i'm able to watch whenever i wish
i highly recommend anyone interested in postwar british films to watch this
my only minor quibble with the film i grew up knowing as stairway to heaven is the fact that the wonderful raymond massey is relegated to the last twenty or so minutes in the trial scene
and the trial itself imo is the least interesting portion of this fascinating fantasybr br david niven and kim hunter are wonderfully cast as the young lovers but it 's roger livesey who gives the liveliest and most credible performance
french accented marius goring is a delight as the heavenly messenger sent to reclaim niven when his wartime death goes unreported due to an oversight
goring has some of the wittiest lines and delivers them with relishbr br seeing this tonight on tcm for the first time in twenty or so years i think it 's a supreme example of what a wonderful year 1946 was for films
the technicolor photography somewhat subdued and not garish at all is excellent and the way it shifts into bw for the heavenly sequences is done with great imagination and effectivenessbr br the opening scene is the sort that really draws a viewer into the fantasy aspects of the storyand niven 's tense talk with radio operator hunter while his plane is crashing toward earth unexpectedly leads to a memorable romantic encounter
truly a marvelous film from beginning to end another triumph for michael powell and emeric pressburger
this is probably one of the most original love stories i have seen for ages especially for a war based film
basically it is a story based in two worlds one obviously real the other fictitious but the filmmakers say at the beginning that it is only coincidence if it is a real place
anyway peter carter was going to crash in a plane he talked to june before he bailed out and said he loved her
he was meant to die from jumping without a parachute but somehow he survived and now he is seeing and loving june in the flesh
this other place like a heaven is unhappy because he survived and was meant to come to their world so they send french conductor 71 to persuade him to go but he is obviously in love
peter suggests to him that he should appeal to keep his life to the other world 's court he is granted this
obviously love prevails when the two lovers announce that they would die for each other june even offers to take his place
also starring robert coote as bob trubshawe kathleen byron as an angel a brief lord sir richard attenborough as an english pilot and abraham sofaer as the judgethe surgeon
david niven was number 36 on the 50 greatest british actors the film was number 86 on the 100 greatest tearjerkers for the happy ending it was number 47 on the 100 greatest war films it was number 46 on the 50 greatest british films and it was number 59 on the 100 greatest films
outstanding
a wonderful film by powell and pressburger whose work i now want to explore more
the film is about what we perceive as real and what is real and how the two can be so difficult to distinguish from one another
beautifully shot and acted although david niven does n't seem to be 27 years old as his character claims to be
fun to see a very young richard attenborough
this film made me think while i was watching it and afterwards
why is this movie not in the 250 best
this movie looks still astoundingly fresh 56 years after its production but it could only have been made at the aftermath of wwii because of the perception of the nearness of death
people were more aware that life could be stopped at one unexpected moment
and what after life
i liked the scene at the end with the judgment and all people of all nations gathered
the phlegmatic judge doctor reeves defending peter carter and also june against the american prosecutor abraham farlan
it is all so imaginative
michael powell wrote directed and produced this astonishing movie which is a real tourdeforce
the message of the movie is clear in the universe the law is the most important but on earth nothing goes beyond the love between humans
the way in which this beautiful story is told is far more interesting than any hollywoodmovie could ever make
i saw this movie years ago on late night television
back then it went by the title of stairway to heaven
even as a young boy i remember being deeply moved by the story and astounded by the visual effects of the court trial
such imagination
a perfect blend of romance drama humour and fantasy this movie is right up there with the greatest classics ever made citizen kane casablanca gone with the wind
this movie is rated extremely high by imdb voters and rightly so over 51 voters rated it 10 out of 10 over 84 rated it 8 or higher out of 10 i was surprised it was not listed in the top 250 films until i realized so few have seenrated this movie compared to those on the list
what a pity
i hope this movie gets released on dvd for region 1 so that 1 i can purchase it and 2 others discover this hidden treasure
just after the end of wwii powell pressburger were asked to come up with something to try to heal the rift developing between the uk the usa
at the time there was a lot of overpaid over sexed and over here type of comments
somehow they came up with this masterpiecebr br my favourite movie of all time
it 's got everything
romance poetry emotion religion drama and very quirkybr br i can never explain exactly why but it hits all the right buttons and although i 've seen it hundreds of times i'm still guaranteed to be in tears at many points throughoutbr br was it the magnificent acting the wonderful sets the inspired script
who knows
but do watch it and you 'll see what i mean
if ever anyone queries whether cinema is an art form you can do worse than pointing them at this moviebr br quite simply it is the perfect combination of story script actors and cinematography ever committed to celluloidbr br the story of a doomed bomber pilot who is missed by his heavenly conductor in the english fog during the second world war and his subsequent brushes with the celestial authorities is played with panache by david niven and kim hunter and is incredibly touching especially in the opening scenes when the doomed pilot describes his plight to the ground radio operator br br the sense of otherworldliness is heightened by jack cardiff 's photography and the incredible production designsbr br the supreme touches extend to the heaven shots appearing in black and white and earthbound scenes presented in technicolour this is even mentioned by the celestial conductor br br not only a highpoint in british cinema but a highpoint in cinema period
it is no surprise that writerdirector michael powell considered a matter of life and death his and emeric pressburger 's spellbinding fantasy from 1946 to be his favourite of their films together
released during the aftermath of world war 2 this colourful romantic adventure would have provided just the tonic for a traumatised recovering nation in need of a good upliftbr br following a string of other patriotic war films 'the archers' made this one their quirkiest skittish and most patriotic of the lot
quintessentially british for upholding british heritage it is also visibly americanised in its baroque compositions technical inventiveness and a fine multiethnic castbr br oddly echoing another 1946 classic it 's a wonderful life amolad opens on a grand firmament with one of those jolly voiceovers preaching about the earth and the heavens and what a big wonderful world we live in
br br it then cuts to the inside of a british cockpit badly hit up in flames and with the copilot already dead
it sounds misconceived but the connection is soon made lucid with the events that followbr br clocking in at nearly 5 minutes the rapidfire exchange between british pilot peter and american radio contact june is breathtaking in its intimacy
resigned to dying peter nevertheless exhausts plenty of vigour charm and outpouring confessions and his warm affiliation with june closes with a mutual exchange of 'i love you'
br br keeping with the magic of the moment peter by oversight of his conductor 71 whose job it was to transport him to the 'other world' escapes death and finds himself stranded on a beach
he later encounters june riding a bicycle and instantly matches the body with the voice
br br but realising their error the high court want peter sent back and order the french conductor down to earth to retrieve him
but peter is adamant to live because of june and the conductor 's mistake and wilfully guards his cornerbr br peter 's fate ultimately lies with the heavenly court and american prosecutor whose jury consists of several deceased war heroes and posh british delegates
the surreal trial which dissolves from bw back into rich technicolor once the verdict is announced may well be a dream but the final shot in the hospital validates the predictable outcomebr br the abstract frame filling stairway to heaven is used twice the first time in bw when it elevates peter and his enigmatic french guardian upwards crossing giant statues of peter 's potential attorneys for the trial including abraham lincoln and plato
the second time the softly lit colour stairway provides the setting for what is an iconic image in cinema peter and june frozen sidebyside their marvelled eyes fixed forward in the frame their fate sealedbr br the unlikely affection shared between peter and june never turns mushy or verbose it 's treated with nobility and the perception that the couple are already suitable enough to be married and simply need to convince people of their love so it can keep them together
br br the french conductor who can freeze time and people 's bodies obtrudes many of their key moments together lecturing peter about history and among his mischievous tricks pinching peter 's 'top 100 game tricks' book and his coffee cupbr br as visually inspired as other powellpressburger collaborations this was the first time they combined colour with bw the latter having a cheerful quality when used for the heaven scenes and both are equally captivating
br br the outstanding script more than matches the imaginative set design with dialogue that sounds so immediate that is does n't feel like it was written or performed for the screen
amusing and witty powellpressburger 's writing deserves equal acclamation with their forte for colour and compositionbr br made in 1946 a matter of life and death is one of those films that defies it age looking fresh and inventive even in this age where cgi would vamp up its artificial effects probably stripping them of their emotional wonder
br br other jarring changes would include the need for reduced average seconds for cutting and the inevitable plea to shorten dialogue so it can preserve the low attention spans of most audiences
powell weaves a spell that subconsciously absorbs the viewer from the first frame giving him freedom to experiment with images without betraying the logical development of peter 's predicament
if you want to be cynical and pedantic you could point out that the opening where a raf lancaster bomber is mortally wounded on the 2nd of may 1945 is somewhat unlikely since german air defences were as lively as adolph hitler on that day but this is n't a movie that should be viewed by a cynical audience and i guess a character being killed in literally the last hours of the war adds to the poignancy
in fact you 'd have to have survived the second world war to fully appreciate the intellect beauty and soul of powell and pressburger 's masterpiece
the scenes of heaven are painfully twee when viewed today
again you have to view the movie of the context when it was made
raf bomber command lost 58000 men during the war the same number that america lost in 'nam but during a shorter period and a far far smaller pool of active combatants there 's no atheists in a fox hole and i doubt if you 'd lost a relative during the conflict you 'd view material atheism as being a sensible thing
when richar attenborough 's young pilot looks down in awe at the sight below him many war heroes must have openly wept at this scene as they remembered much missed comrades who did n't survive the war
also bare in mind that despite losing several million people from 193945 there seems to be very few people from germany passing through the pearly gates
it 's obvious nazis do n't go to heaven br br the plot itself where dashing young pilot peter carter arguing for his life in front of a celestial court would n't have had much appeal to me if it was n't for the subtext you see a matter or life and death is a highly political and visionary film that laments the end of the british empire as it 's replaced by american ambitions
there 's little things that show up the film as being made by people aware of american history and culture
one is the ethnic mix of america even today many britons think that the usa is overwhelmingly composed of white anglo saxon protestants when in fact only 51 of americans are white european
the film rightly contains a scene where a multitude of different races confess i am an american as peter is judged by abraham farlan an anglophobe who was the first revolutionary killed by british forces in the american war of independence
as for the special relationship between britain and america what special relationship
powell and pressburger know their history when it comes to britain and america
they obviously know their future too br br so remember to watch this movie with some of your mind in the past and some of your mind in the present
it 's strange beautiful poignant and clever but most of all it 's a film that would never ever work if it were made in the last 40 years
can you imagine if the story was set in 2003 and revolved around a british soldier killed in iraq
this is one of the most overlooked gems hollywood has ever produced
a young wwii british fighter ace whose plane is about to crash has radio contact with a young american woman who comforts the brave pilot knowing that within minutes he will be dead
for some reason the man who should certainly be dead walks away from the wreckage and eventually learns that he was meant to report to heaven
when a messanger is sent to ask the pilot to accompany him to heaven the man refuses and demands to have his day in court to argue his case
the man argues that his situation had changed during the final moments of his earthly life that he had fallen in love and therefor had become a different person one who deserved a chance to live on
br br the heavenly court is a cinematic delight
the announcement of the jury of peers is a definite highlight
the story as fantastic as it seems is an engaging one and will keep you spellbound for the nearly 2 hours play time
the final scene is simply beautiful and will require a kleenex treatment for most viewers
this film is in my personal alltime favorite top 10 it has my highest recommendation
the great talents of michael powell and emeric pressberger are noticeable in their wonderful a matter of life and death
it was part of the recent tribute to mr powell that played at the walter reade in new york
this film in particular shows us one of the best british films from that or any other erabr br a matter of life and death has a brilliant cinematography by jack cardiff a man who knew how to work wonders with a camera
particularly impressive is the contrast from the monochromatic tones given to the scenes played in heaven and the colored ones when the action comes back to earth
this was quite a coup and well ahead of its times
the black and white sequence that involves the long staircase where peter and the conductor are chatting has to be one of the most amazing things on any filmbr br much has been said in this forum about the film so our comment will be about the great acting powell and pressberger got out of the large distinguished cast who responded magnificently to the directors' guidancebr br david niven is peter whose aircraft is hit and his best friend dies as a result of it
this film marked one of the highlights in mr niven 's career
he was an excellent film actor as he shows us in this movie
kim hunter is surprisingly good as june the woman who talked to peter as his plane was falling from the skies
as fate would have it peter and june fall in love at first sightbr br some of the best british film actors grace this film with their presence
robert coote is bob the man who is admitted to heaven but he is surprised his friend peter never made the trip with him
an excellent star turn by marius goring who as the conductor 71 steals the film
mr goring who had worked with the directors is one of the best things in the movie
also roger livesey as dr frank reeves does one of the best appearances of his career as well as raymond massey who is seen as abraham farlanbr br a matter of life and death is a timeless film that will always be seen with gratitude toward its creators
this movie has the most beautiful opening sequence ever made
i 've seen this movie for the first time a week ago since then every day i see the opening and every time i feel as thrilled as i felt the first time i heard david niven uttering the immortal words from sir walter raleigh 's the pilgrimagebr br give me my scallopshell of quiet my staff of faith to walk upon my scrip of joy immortal diet my bottle of salvation my gown of glory hope 's true gage and thus i 'll take my pilgrimage br br do you know why it would be a truism to say michael powell 's and emeric pressuburger 's lives are thoroughly justified for having crafted such a wonderful opening
because they had been already admitted in the paradise of poets long before they made this moviebr br i imagine both of them facing trial during doomsday and saying nonchalantly to an irate god i beg your pardon sir
so do you want to know what have we done during our lifetime
well well you 'll see we 've written directed and produced i know where i'm going colonel blimp red shoes do you think that enough sir
it is rather obvious that these two great artists had already fulfilled their duty with god nature the muse or whatever you may call it when they shot a matter of life and death
the fact that other people 's lives would be justified for their deeds could be not apparent to everybody notwithstanding i feel my life would have a meaning had i never done anything else that to see this moviebr br of course oldtimers will be tempted to say they do n't do movies like this one any more
they 'll be partially mistaken they did n't make movies like this in the past times eitherbr br i 've have already quoted keats here but i 'll repeat his words a thing of beauty is a joy forever
enchanting romantic innovative and funny
the vision of this extraordinary film is almost unparalleled exceeding better known death romances such as ghost
while we know intuitively that peter and june will find ultimate happiness at the end of that longlong stairway the joy is in the journey
the moral of the tale of course is timeless love conquers all
but the struggle to achieve that victory is played in a celestial arena of sweeping vision and gripping grandeur
with more than 500 suitably clad extras portraying various ages and cultures the directors' vision of heaven remains memorable six decades later far into the cgi erabr br yet for all the cosmic scale powell and pressburger knew an essential truth the best story is told at the smallest level
the wonderfully determinedly romantic aspect of stairway is captured with ultimate simplicity june 's teardrop preserved on a rose petal
br br this film like the story and the set itself is one for the ages
i love this movie
director michael powell once stated that this was his favorite movie and it is mine as well
powell and pressburger created a seemingly simple superbly crafted story the power of love against the powers that be
however its deception lies in the complexity of its is it real or is it imaginary premise
basically one could argue that it is simply a depiction of the effects of war on a young poetically inclined airman during wwii
or is it
the question is never answered one way or the other
actually it is never even asked
this continuous understatement is part of the film 's appealbr br the innovative photography and cinematography even includes some nice touches portraying the interests of the filmmakers
for instance pressburger always wanted to do a cinematic version of richard strauss' opera der rosenkavalier about a young 18th century viennese aristocrat
this is evident in the brief interlude in which conductor 71 dressed in all his finery holds the rose
the music even has a dreamy qualitybr br all of the acting is first rate david niven is at his most charming and he has excellent support from veteran roger livesey and relative newcomer kim hunter
but in my opinion the film 's charm comes from marius goring as conductor 71 he by far has the most interesting role filling each of his scenes with his innocent lightheartedness brightening the film
it 's a pity that some of conductor 71 's scenes were left on the cutting room floor
it is also a pity that goring 's comedic talents are rarely seen again on film except in the wonderful videos of the scarlet pimpernel television series from the 1950s
this is by far and away the most memorable role of his film career
he is a perfect foil for relaxed style of niven and his virtual overstatement contrasts so nicely with the seriousness of the rest of the characters
ironically also in the mid 1940s niven also starred against another heavenly messenger played by cary grant in the bishop 's wife
their acting styles were so similar that i found the result boring unenergetic and disappointing
as a note according to powell goring desperately wanted the role of peter carter initially refusing conductor 71 it 's a good thing he gave in and gave us such a delightful portrayalbr br the movie commissioned to smooth over the strained relations between britain and the us overdrives its point towards the end
but it is disarming in its gentle reminders of the horrors of war the numerous casualties both military and civilian the need to go on when faced with death
there is a conspicuous lack of wwii enemies in heaven but the civilians shown are of indeterminate origin
powell and pressburger could have been more explicit in their depiction but it was n't necessary
the movie may not have served its diplomatic purpose as was hoped for but its originality continues to inspire moviemakers and viewers alike on both sides of the atlantic
the opening flourishes left me purring with delight at their inventiveness the altered version of the archers' logo the introductory disclaimer the way the camera pans over the cosmos
it 's strange to think that it 's a wonderful life' came out in the same year
no great coincidence the 1940s was awash with heavenandearth films but the glowing cotton wool nebulas and cutesy angels of the competition look tattered something best passed over in silence when placed next to alfred junge 's visionbr br it continues to look great all the way through as more and more striking ideas are sprung upon us
i'm not a great fan of mixing colour with black and white in general
one of the two visual schemes almost always looks ugly when placed next to the other
not so here
powell dissolves colour into monochrome and monochrome into colour as if it 's the most natural thing in the world a mere change of palettes
both the colour photography and the black and white could stand on their ownbr br as for the story this may be pressburger 's best script or at least it would have been had the conclusion been a more logical outcome of preceding events
other than that it 's tight yet with more going on than i can possibly allude to here
was the heavenly stuff real or imaginary
everyone says we 're meant to neither ask nor answer this question but i do n't see why
i'm sure we are meant to ask the question
the film even gives us clues as to what the answer is indeed the problem is that there are too many clues and they seem at first to be pointing in different directions
the fact that other things ought to occupy our attention as well does n't mean that this should n't occupy us as well
there is as i 've said before a lot going onbr br consider the scene in which abraham farlan plays a radio broadcast of a cricket match and contemptuously says the voice of england 1945'
dr reeves acknowledges the exhibit with a great deal of embarrassment and then produces one of his own a blues song from america which farlan listens to as though he 's got a lemon in his mouth
reeves looks smugbr br snobbery
well i do n't see why it 's snobbish to condemn blues music and that 's not what powell and pressburger are doing anyway
as the song is being played we get a shot of the american soldiers listening to it several of them nod their heads to the rhythm perfectly at home
they do n't find it incomprehensible
there 's something valuable about the song and neither reeves nor farlan knows what it is
reeves probably realises as much
all english audiences know without being told that there is something of value in the cricket broadcast too and that while reeves understands that he is unable to explain it to farlan hence the blues broadcast which shows that people can understand each other without sharing an understanding of everything else
it 's a clever scenebr br one last thing
i found david niven a bit cold without the charisma he would acquire later in his career but even so i do n't think a film has grabbed my heart quite so quickly after the action began as this one did
a matter of life and death what can you really say that would properly do justice to the genius and beauty of this film
powell and pressburger 's visual imagination knows no bounds every frame is filled with fantastically bold compositions
the switches between the bold colours of the real world to the stark black and white of heaven is ingenious showing us visually just how much more vibrant life is
the final court scene is also fantastic as the judge and jury descend the stairway to heaven to hold court over peter 's operation
br br all of the performances are spot on and the romantic energy of the film is beautiful never has there been a more romantic film than this
a matter of life and death is all about the power of love and just how important life is
and jack cardiff 's cinematography is reason enough to watch the film alone the way he lights kim hunter 's face makes her all the more beautiful what a genius he can make a simple things such as a game of table tennis look exciting
and the sound design is also impeccable the way the sound mutes at vital points was a decision way ahead of its timebr br this is a true classic that can restore anyone 's faith in cinema under appreciated on its initial release and by today 's audiences but one of my all time favourites which is why i give this film a 1010 in a word beautiful
few movies can be viewed almost 60 years later yet remain as engrossing as this one
technological advances have not dated this classic love story
special effects used are remarkable for a 1946 movie
the acting is superb
david niven kim hunter and especially roger livesey do an outstanding job
the use of black and white color adds to the creative nature of the movie
it has n't been seen on television for 20 years so few people are even aware of its existence
it is my favorite movie of all time
waiting and hoping for the dvd release of this movie for so many years is in itself a matter of life and death
to me a matter of life and death is just that simply the best film ever madebr br from beginning to end it oozes class
it is stimulating thought provoking a mirror to the post war world and the relations between peoplesbr br the cinematography is simply stunning and the effect of mixing monochrome and technicolour to accent the different worlds works seamlessly
the characters and plot development are near perfect and the attention to detail promotes a thoroughly believable fantasybr br no matter how many times i watch the film and i have watched it a lot it never fails to touch me
it makes me smile it makes me laugh it makes me think it makes me cry
it is as fresh today as it was in 1946br br if i were allowed just one film to keep and watch again a matter of life and death would be that film
return to cabin by the lake is perhaps one of the few sequels that can live up to the original
it had black humor good suspense nice looking girls and of course a psycho killer
what are we missing
i think nothing
except we are left with a small amount of gore and nudity because it was made for television
besides being one of the best sequels it is one of the best thrillers to watch as a family
recommended for everyone
the first was good and original
i was a not bad horrorcomedy movie
so i heard a second one was made and i had to watch itbr br what really makes this movie work is judd nelson 's character and the sometimes clever script
a pretty good script for a person who wrote the final destination films and the direction was okay
sometimes there 's scenes where it looks like it was filmed using a home video camera with a grainylookbr br great madefortv movie
it was worth the rental and probably worth buying just to get that nice eerie feeling and watch judd nelson 's stanley doing what he does bestbr br i suggest newcomers to watch the first one before watching the sequel just so you 'll have an idea what stanley is like and get a little history background
actually that video camera effect is just that it 's an effect a rather good one this film is in fact better than the original it 's great fun to watch made for tv does n't need to follow any rules
i find it hard to watch number 1 because of how he kills the first girl its disturbing
and all the time we are routing for judd nelson to get away with it we as the viewers are on his side
i hope one day we will see a 3rd cabin by the lake but i doubt it
watching this film you can understand how real movies are made as this is sort of like a film within a film
judd is one of the scariest villains ever and he 's more realistic he does n't just mindlessly chop people up like in other horrors
as a sequelthis is not a bad moviei actually liked it better than the 1st onei found it more entertainingit seemed like it was shot documentary styleat first this bothered meas i thought it just looked too low budgetbut it grew on meand it made the movie seem more authenticthis movie has more dry one liners than the originalwhich is a good thingin my opinioni do think at times they went a bit over the top with some of the scenes and the charactersit almost becomes a parody of itselfwhich may be the pointthis movie at least has some suspensewhich the 1st one did not havein my viewit has some of the same great music from the originalwhich is greatthe acting again was pretty decent for the most partthough like i saidsome of it seemed over the topi also felt that the movie loses a lot of momentum towards the end and there are a few minutes which seem really slow and just do n't seem to flowlike the rest of the movieoverallthoughi thought this was a pretty sequelmy rating for return to cabin by the lake is 710
when i first found out that brian krause was going to be in this movie i wanted to watch
it took me weeks to realize that i 've seen the original of this and loved it
so i had even more reason to watch
well i watched
it was actually better than most sequels for tv movies
i hate what happens to brian 's character and i did n't like most of the characters brian 's one included
but the movie needed the cheesy and annoying and jerklike characters to make stanley caldwell shine once more
at the end i was cheering for stanley and his own happy ending
if you liked the original cabin by the lake or if you like horror movies without the blood i 'd suggest you watch this
this movie is the best horror movie barnonei love how stanley just dumps the women into the lakei have been a fan of judd nelson 's work for many years and he blew me away
its a blend of horror and drama and romance not so much comedy
his evil yet charming look captured me right then and there
that look in his eyes i will never forget
there 's something about him i cant describe
i loved this movie
it was almost the same as the first only instead of just killing women he kills men also
and the scenes are much more interesting 2 of my favorite scenes are firstly when stanley and allison are in the dance club and he is describing kimberly 's last moments before she is thrown to the water and secondly when stanley is visiting allison in his basement right before they head down to the set when she kisses him
those scenes for me were very intense and riveting
i gave the movie a rating of 810 not because the movie was bad but because the filming was bad i mean there were times when you 'd notice nothing was wrong like its being shot the way a film is usually shot you would n't see the live camera shooting but then very little you would notice the filming mistakes
what went wrong
sequels hardly ever live up to the original
this definitely proves true in this case
however if you 're a big fan of the original than definitely give this a watch
although the camera work is lacking brian krause 's character is annoying and the plot is clique it 's much more funnier than the first and that is what i find entertaining about it
br br do n't see this movie expecting the same performance as in the first film
quite frankly it 's a bit different
rather than sitting in his cabin writing screenplays stanley is off in hollywood trying to direct his dream project cabin by the lake
this movie has a much different feel but it 's still great to see stanley back in actionbr br i'm giving it a 6 out of 10
i thought it was one of the best sequels i have seen in a while
sometimes i felt as though i would just want someone to die stanley 's killing off of the annoying characters was brilliant
it was such a well done movie that you were happy when so and so died
my only problem was in some scenes it looked like someone with a home camera was filming it and it was weird
judd nelson is cute at least in my opinion and he was excellent in the role as stanley caldwell
brilliant movie
i do n't know if i'm just weird but i thoroughly enjoyed this film
br br return to cabin by the lake is of course the sequel to another one of my favorite films cabin by the lake
in fact i think that i enjoyed this movie even more than the first one
i also thought that the cast in this movie was great judd nelson is always the best
i also enjoyed the plot as a whole
i liked the fact that this second movie focused on the filming of stanley 's screenplay cabin by the lake it was n't a completely redundant film of stanley grabbing other girls and drowning them
if you 're looking for some deep meaning then this film is probably not the one for you
however if you 're looking for a fun way to spend two hours then go ahead and watch it
i 've probably already killed at least ten hours watching this film
this movie was just as good as some of the other westerns made by anthony mann and james stewart like winchester '73 and the naked spur and much better than thunder bay and bend of the river
this film starts out like a run of the mill western but gets more complex as it goes along
it starts out with jimmy stewart and walter brennan arriving in seattle and stewart is charged with murder
he is found innocent but is cattle is stolen by a corrupt judge
stewart then agrees to lead something but i forget what it is but stewart only cares about getting his cattle back
as the movie goes along it 's like stewart only cares about himself just like his character in the naked spur
it gets much better at the halfway point after they arrive in alaska
this is one of stewart 's better westerns
the year is 1896jeff webster does n't like peoplethere 's only one friend he 's got and he 's ben tatum an old sympathetic manthey 're driving a cattle herd with themthat would be their key to richnessin skagway they run into trouble when sheriff gannon takes the cattlenow jeff only has to get it back and drive it through the us canadian border to dawsonnow they have a group of other people with them like the ladies ronda castle and renee vallon there the two men get into the gold businessanthony mann 's and james stewart 's fourth collaboration the far country is a fine western indeedthe acting work is superbwalter brennan makes a terrific sidekick to stewartruth roman is brilliant and corinne calvet 's delightfuljay c flippen is very good as dawson marshal rube morristhe great jack elam and kathleen freeman are seen in smaller rolesit 's fantastic to watch how jimmy stewart overcome 's all the troubles in his waythere 's just the man and his riflebut also he 's vulnerable
this is such a fantastic movie a western about a selfconcerned man going up to the klondike for gold
on the way he gets hassled by a local sheriff in alaska whom he hassles back
mcintire threatens that he 'll be a dead man if he ever comes back through his town which is unfortunately the only way back to the states
the main chunk of the story is about the peaceful klondike town of dawson being turned upside down by new residents from mcintire 's town
ruth roman for instance who has come with stewart and his two companions builds a saloon and tries to run the town 's restaurant and hangout place out of business
she paves the way for mcintire and his goons to come up too
in 1953 jimmy stewart and director anthony mann made one of the peaks of the western genre the naked spur
the far country is just the tiniest bit less and it contains 999 of what made that film so special without of course feeling like a cheap copy
like the naked spur the far country boasts beautiful onlocation cinematography
the landscape is gorgeous
stewart gives one of his best performances
i suppose it could be considered cliche as he starts out a selfish loner and learns how that kind of existence plays out in the end
still stewart plays it so damn well he makes this character very human
and the supporting performances are universally fantastic
in addition to those i 've mentioned the adorable french actress corinne calvet is very good
and i ought to single out walter brennen as well
he seems to have specialized in playing best friends
his relationship with stewart is very touching since he is at first the only character who is able to bring out any humanity in the cynical man
the screenplay is very well written and mann 's direction is impeccable
a masterpiece
1010
the fourth of five westerns anthony mann did with james stewart this one involves a hard bitten cattleman named jeff webster who takes a cattle drive from wyoming to alaska via seattle
he hooks up in seattle with his partners ben tatum and rube morris that he has sent ahead of time in order to make preparations for the boat trip northbr br but first he has to put up with insubordinate trail hands cheating riverboat captains and the charms of coy manipulative ronda castle who believes jeff could be a valuable ally in the future
that 's why she hides him out on the boat while the captain 's looking for him for the earlier killing of a trail handbr br jeff also has the misfortune of running into sleazy judge gannon who runs the town of skagway alaska
gannon locks jeff up for disrupting his public hanging by running his cattle through town
he fines jeff the ownership of his cattle and jeff just has to eat crow for the time being
br br in the meantime jeff agrees to ride point for ronda up to dawson in order to deliver supplies
but this is just a ruse so jeff ben and rube can slip back into skagway and steal his cattle back
of course judge gannon finds out about this and is right behind but is delayed by jeff with a rifle while ben races the cattle over the canadian border out of gannon 's reachbr br after avoiding an avalanche and another shootout with some other skagway men they finally reach dawson where jeff sells his cattle to the highest bidder which just happens to be ronda who then promptly sets up a new gambling house in dawson
jeff then takes his money and buys himself a claim and starts panning for gold
br br but then judge gannon comes up to dawson to get in on the gold action up there and tells jeff that he was getting a little bored with skagway and wants to try his luck up in the klondike himself
that involves bring some hired gunman with him and forcibly stealing some of the other miner 's claims
jeff and ben now feel it 's time to clear out while the goings are good leaving rube to fend for himself as a most ineffective sheriff against gannon and his gangbr br they look for a back way out only to find themselves ambushed by gannon 's men because ben made the mistake of opening his big mouth
ben is killed and jeff is severely wounded but that does n't save judge gannon from his just due
the ending shootout at night on the muddy dawson street pretty much takes care of that
first jeff kills two of gannon 's best gunman
then as ronda comes out to warn jeff that gannon is trying to slip around behind him gannon shoots her in the back and she dies right there in jeff 's arms
then jeff kills gannon as he 's hiding under a wooden sidewalk
revenge has spokenbr br this is another riproaring western that 's right up there with the naked spur and the man from laramie
why the universal dvd uses a panandscan print instead of the widescreen print tcm uses is beyond me
you 'll wind up missing half the glorious alberta cinematography by william daniels
so if you like wellwritten 50s westerns then this one 's an alist keeper
br br 8 out of 10
now admittedly i'm no ardent student of the genre
as a matter of fact i 've tended always to shy away from westerns because in spite of all their critical cachet as america 's primal stories they seem to me to forever devolve into tiresome retreads of either shoot up the injuns the big gunfight or hey let 's form a posse
in other words it always seemed to me a genre so rooted in and tied to convention that it left precious little room for surprise or originality
br br but when i saw this movie on tv as part of a commemorative jimmy stewart weekend upon his death i finally got it i understood at least in theory what the western mythos has to offer as a serious thematic preoccupation
it is the pushpull between lawlessness and order the american west represented freedom but also the prospect of the wild the untamed
respectable folk could get hurt out there
which of course meant that perhaps just perhaps it was n't meant for respectable folk and that the only residents should be the amoral and the shifty those who dispensed justice strictly from the barrel of their revolvers and where kill or be killed would ever be the law of the land
in such an environment of course the true heroes are the ones who are ornery and freespirited enough to be out there in the first place and yet have enough sense of justice to believe that a society based on chaos and fear just is not right
catching and examining that disparity between law and disorder in the main character himself is i believe the highest and truest goal of any western
sadly it is so often not the case as the white hats are completely white the black ones completely black and there is precious little shades of gray in betweenbr br not in this one
jimmy stewart plays a blatant fortune hunter who follows the trail of miners before him into the alaskan wilderness to prospect for gold
he is joined in this by his lifelong buddy played by walter brennan and no one else
pointedly they are out for themselves and while stewart displays his patented charm we are left with little doubt that his is basically a selfcentered selfinterested character none of his gosh or oh golly gee humanism is allowed to come through
or rather it has to be earned by the end of the picture in the way i described above
he must confront the lawlessness in himself and weigh it against the need for order and justice which are so blatantly lacking in the border town which serves as the miners' starting point on their gold dust trail
this town is ruled tightly by its wicked sheriff mr gannon played by john mcintire in one of the best bad guy performances i 've ever seen
he comes on with so much charm and humor and has such a relaxed and interesting rapport with stewart that it actually takes awhile to recognize that he is the bad guy so that when it finally sinks in it does so with double force
further by establishing a type of breezy camaraderie between mcintire and stewart the film plays up the notion of how close in temperament they really are and so how far a moral distance stewart must walk by the end of the filmbr br i wo n't go through all the twists and turns the plot takes see those for yourself
what 's key here is how much this story focuses upon character with great dialogue and character interaction substituting for gunplay much of the time although the film has just enough action and adventure to prevent it from ever being static
definitely one of the greatest performances i 've seen from stewart showing he could play the renegade the man 's man just as convincingly as the decent and upright guy next door
if anything in fact his everyman qualities lend greater strength to his characterization making him seem less mythic or overblown like say eastwood or john wayne and more a threedimensional personage
his relationship with brennan is wellplayed understated but nevertheless touching br br i certainly have more westerns to see but this is for now my favorite and the yardstick by which i will necessarily judge all the others
it deserves to be much better known and appreciated than it is
after losing his cattle herd to a dishonest lawman a trail boss winds up in the yukon gold fields with a bad reputation and small chances of being able to return to the states
while there his fortunes take a turn for the best until a bad luck specter from the past comes calling
good western with many favorite old faces in the lineup
br br it 's interesting how anthony mann uses james stewart here
stewart is of course remembered by many as george bailey from frank capra 's it 's a wonderful life so it 's easy to find parallels between the two films
in it 's a wonderful life bailey gets to see the world as it would have been if he had never been born
in the far country stewart 's jeff webster by not getting involved to help anyone else gets to see essentially the same thing a world in which he does n't existbr br by not getting involved webster is forced to see those for whom he ca n't help but care get hurt pushed around and even killed while he stands by and does nothing
this reminds the viewer of george bailey watching a world that has turned upsidedown because he has also decided not to get involved by not ever having been born
br br both movies end with the same image a closeup of a ringing bell
stewart by turning around his philosophy of noninvolvement has it would seem earned his wings
my comment would have been added to the release date section but i could n't find a place for it
i was really surprised to see that this movie was released in the us in feb 1955 i saw it in a first run theater in washington dc in march 1958 wonder if it was rereleased or some problem
in my opinion this movie is very light entertainment but has some classic characters
john mcintyre does a bangup job as a corrupt judgeentrepreneurthief
walter brennan does basically the same role he did in red river years earlier
and in my opinion james stewart gives as fine a performance as he ever did
i have seen this movie a half dozen times or more and never tire of seeing parts of it again
the photography and scenery are splendid and it offers a remarkable amount of entertainment in one hour and thirtysix minutes
cowboys james stewart and walter brennan take their herd from seattle to alaska and on into canada to stake a claim
once there they have to contend with seductive shifty businesswoman ruth roman and icecold happygolucky villain james mcintirebr br john wayne may get talked about more but his good pal stewart made some excellent hardedged westerns too some with the great director anthony mann
frankly i 'd take this with it 's sturdy action sequences and fine melodrama over north to alaska any daybr br the far country features some breathtaking scenery and cinematography that should definitely have been shot in widescreenbr br also there 's some strong support by the always reliable brennan roman the incredibly cute corrine calvet and james mcintire who plays one of my favorite types of bad guy the kind that does n't take himself too seriouslybr br this would make a great doublebill with another highly recommended mannstewart northwestset western bend of the river
as i drove from skagway alaska to dawson cityyukon a couple of years ago and was impressed with the scenery i cannot help but wish that this film even though it has beautiful color and scenic views would have been shot in the actual location
jasper in the canadian rockies is a magnificent place but still not the real place where the film takes place
when the story moves to dawson that is when i feel anthony mann who used the outdoor locations so well could have made the most if he filmed in the actual place
james stewart here is again a man fighting within himself one side of him does not want to get involved and help people who stand in the way of him making money and the other side just is not able to look away from people being murdered
ruth roman is the ambitious woman who does not care on whom she steps corinne calvet is the nice girl
mann is excellent directing the shootouts but the high point of the film is how well he does in the outdoor scenes
he uses the outdoors as much as he can and he is helped by the winter scenery the predominating white like it was with the greens in the naked spur and the browns in the man from laramie
like all of the mannstewarts this is a traditional western with a difference in the elaboration of stewart 's character which is more complex
classic dramaaction western with incredible cinematography that is well ahead of it 's time
the production is very good and you can tell that it was done with pride and loveunique peek into the american northt west pioneers is very educational and entertainingthis movie is very under rated because most people do not like to see the reality that many lawmen during this particular time and place were very crookedcorrupt much like most developing countries todaythe action sequences could have been more realistic though but stillthis movie really covers most of the essentialsnot for an audience who wants only pure testoterone type westerns for this movie is more for those who have a sense of history and philosophy
a good film withfor its timean intense sprawling rather dark story somewhat reminiscent of john ford 's the searchers though not so brutal
the story starts fast and does n't let up with several scenes of really good dialog between jeff webster ronda castle and sheriff gannon
this film is in some ways reminiscent of bend of the river also a mannstewart work but i found it far less sentimental and more interesting
there are a few caveats a tooquickly wrapped up ending 24yearold corrine calvert is not very convincing as a naive french teenager and of course the film takes place in the mythic west a land of fable where the real laws of nations and physics do n't apply
but these are trivial concerns
james stewart is surprisingly good as a dark disengaged man who thinks he cares for no one but himself and the mountain scenery ca n't be beat
a fine western costume drama
another very good mann flick thanks to the fatherson combination of walter brennan and jimmy stewart
brennan is often the comedic conscience of either stewart or wayne
he 's there to see that the younger man takes the ride fork or bend
you 're wrong mr dunston
jeff webster gives off the impression he cares only for himself but it is clear he cannot desert brennan
john mcintire is excellent as the law of skagway with due respect for the trappings of justice over the reality of it
another key theme is helping people and in turn being helped by people
the loner can do neither and suffers for itbr br the caption above plays on tatum 's assertion that he ca n't live without his coffee
this nicotine addiction proves fatal
probably the first and last time on the screenbr br i recommend this film and now own the dvd
anthony mann 's westerns with jimmy stewart are slowly gaining for that director a position with john ford and howard hawks as the best film director in that genre
he certainly knows how to give dimension to nice guy stewart in mann 's films there is an edge to jimmy that is slowly demonstrated to the audience
in winchester '73 it was the relationship of stewart to his brother and how it twists him into a figure of vengeance
here it is a i trust only myself attitude which leads to one complication after another
even before the film properly begins he kills two of his hired cowboys who were helping on a cattle drive to seattle because of some dispute
br br he meets his match in skagway the port he has to get to in order to take his herd to dawson
skagway 's boss is a socalled law man named gannon who reminds one of the real boss of skagway in the gold rush jefferson soapy smith and judge roy bean
the problem is that neither smith nor bean would have gotten quite as sleazy as gannon in turning every opportunity into a chance to make some money
stewart 's herd interrupted a public hanging so the herd is confiscated
br br stewart is partner with ben
they are also joined by rube morris and also meet two women the sophisticated rhonda castle and the friendly and helpful renee vallon
rhonda works closely with gannon but had helped jeff earlier in fleeing the authorities in seattle
however she has a similar i only trust myself attitude to jeff
she does offer him employment to get supplies for herself to dawson
he ben and rube go but at night they go back and steal back their cattle
renee follows and warns them that gannon and his associates are following
jeff holds off gannon long enough for the cattle herd to be brought over the canadian border although gannon points out that since jeff has to return by way of skagway gannon can wait until he does to hang himbr br the reunited party of rhonda and jeff split over the trail to take to dawson jeff opting for a longer and safer route
after he is proved right they go by his route and reach dawson only to find there is a lawless element threatening the community due to the gold fields
the herd is sold to rhonda and jeff ben rube and renee start prospecting
there is soon two groups in the town of dawson
one led by connie gilchrist and chubby johnson want to build a decent town
but the mounties wo n't be setting up a station in dawson for months
the other centering around the dancehall run by rhonda are in cahoots with gannon who has a vast claim jumping scheme using his gang of gunslingers
jeff wishes to steer clear of both and head with his new wealth and ben for a ranch they want in utah
but will they get there
and will jeff remain neutralbr br the performances are dandy here including stewart as a man who is willing to face all comers but would otherwise be peaceful enough
brennan is playing one of his patented old codgers whose love of good coffee has unexpectedly bad results
flippen is a drunk at first but tragedy and responsibility shake him into a better frame of mind and one who has a chance to verbally stab stewart in the heart using stewart 's own words against him
mcintyre would achieve stardom on television in wagon train replacing ward bond but his work in mann 's films show his abilities as a villain
he is as is said elsewhere on this thread really sleazy but he has a sense of humor
roman is an interesting blend of opportunist and human being whose fate is determined by her better feelings
and calvert is both a voice of conscience and a frontier gigi aware that she is more than a young girl but a budding womanbr br best of all is the canadian rockies background as wonderful in its way as the use of monument valley by john ford
mann certainly did a first rate job directing this film and the viewer will appreciate the results
this is mostly a story about the growing relationship between jeff webster and ronda castle
she takes an instant liking to jeff in a brief encounter on the deck of the steamer to skagway and a longer look when he hides in her cabin while authorities seek him on a charge of murder
they find out they have some things in common besides an animal attraction
neither trusts a member of the opposite sex apparently because both have been married to spouses who cheated on them
gradually they learn to trust each other as they journey from skagway to dawson
but ronda clearly has close dealings with corrupt sheriff gannon and engages in some shady practices in her castle saloon in skagway
she eventually has to decide between gannon and jeff
meanwhile rene a young naive french woman also takes an immediate liking to jeff but only gets insulting brush offs in return
yet she sticks with him in his travels from skagway to dawson and his activities around dawson
along with ronda she nurses him back to health after jeff is left for dead by gannon 's gunslingers at his gold claim
walter brennan as ben serves as jeff 's long time sidekick
he does n't have a meaty role but serves to soften jeff 's hard edges
his demise symbolically opens the door for a woman companion replacement for jeffbr br john mcintire makes probably the most charismatic evil town boss you will ever see on film oozing charm and humor to go along with his bullying
evidently he sees something of himself in jeff repeatedly declaring that he 's going to like him
he makes a believable incarnation of the infamous soapy smith who spent his last years in skagway as one of the premier con men of his timesbr br jeff is the quintessential antihero a loner who does n't want to stick his neck out for others even when he knows he is the one right man for the job
in this respect he closely resemble 's burt lancaster 's character in vera cruz for example
thus jeff not only turns down the job of marshall of dawson he is convinced to leave dawson after gannon 's gang move in with clear intentions of taking over everyone 's insufficiently legal gold claims while disposing of some miners and suggesting that the rest make a hurried exit from dawson
even ronda suggests that she and jeff make a hurried exit from dawson while they are still alive
then jeff has a sudden change of heart apparently still nursing desire for revenge for the shooting of ben and himself
he changes from antihero to hero in leading the expulsion of gannon 's gang from dawson
in this respect he differs from lancaster 's character who never reformsbr br the main problem i see with the plot is the 2 principle women
clearly ronda is groomed as the right woman to tame jeff
although she is clearly characterized as a bad girl jeff has a checkered recent past himself having shot at least 5 men in the us or yukon and having stolen his cattle back from gannon
ironically soon after jeff changes from antihero to hero rhonda makes a similar change in running into the street to warn jeff of gannon 's impending ambush
she dies as a result and jeff asks her why she did n't just look out for herselfbr br it 's clear that corine calvert as renee just does n't make a credible substitute for the dead ronda in jeff 's mind
yet the apparent implication of the parting scene is that they get together even though jeff never visibly gives her a kiss or hug
her image as a good if naive young woman is somewhat compromised by her job in rhonda 's saloon of bumping miners weighting their gold dust pushing the spilled dust on the floor and recovering it later
i'm also very unclear about her relationship with rube morris a middle aged miner who followers her around and works a claim with her br br another problem is the amateurish handling of the gun fight between jeff and gannon 's gang
if gannon had any skill at all with a pistol he should have killed or seriously wounded jeff under that boardwalk before jeff did the same to him
and how did jeff 's badly shot up right hand suddenly become well enough to shoot a pistol with apparent ease
i also wonder what jeff and friends did to help save the avalanche victims
they were much too far away to pull them out alive from under the snow
and why were n't most of ronda 's pack horses and mules also buried by the avalanchebr br you will see a host of probably nameless but familiar faces among the miners and gannon 's gang
the sequences shot in the canadian rockies provide a breathtaking backdrop to the action
allinall a very entertaining western with most of the major flaws concentrated at the end
no doubt this film takes some great liberties with history and geography especially the part taking place in the canadian yukon which was in fact much tamer than the us skagway
the penultimate collaboration between director anthony mann and star james stewart the far country belies its mainstream look to offer another portrait of an embittered man dragged unwillingly to his own redemption fighting it every step of the way
this time he 's a cattle driver whose response to labour problems challenging troublesome cowhands to a gunfight at the end of the trail results in his cattle being confiscated by john mcintire 's larcenous judge of the roy bean school of law and order
stealing them back and taking them across the canadian border he soon finds himself unwillingly drawn into the growing conflict between prospectors and the judge as he cheats or kills them out of their claims br br while it 's no great surprise which way stewart turns at the end he 's a surprisingly callous critter along the way even using his desire to just be left alone to excuse not warning a group of prospectors of an impending avalanche when he has the chance because it 's not his problem
for most of the film there 's really only a hair 's breadth between him and mcintire something the judge recognises immediately revelling in the company of a kindred spirit even as he 's genially planning to lynch him
in many ways the townspeople who put their faith in him probably recognise it too despite their appeals to his deadandburied better nature there 's an unspoken acknowledgement that the only person who can stand up to the judge is someone almost as bad as he isbr br as usual with mann there 's an exceptional use of high country locations though for once the final showdown takes place on level ground and the film is almost perfectly cast with strong support from walter brennan harry morgan and ruth roman
sadly the great cinematography of the canadian rockies is done few favours by a distinctly average dvd transfer with only the theatrical trailer as an extra
colorful westernbr br wyoming cowboy james stewart moseys on up to the yukon territory to dig for gold sell his steers and try to get a date with pretty saloonowner ruth roman if he can shake the tail of crooked sheriff john mcintire who wants stewart 's cattle
beautiful cinematography in a collaborative effort by william fritzsche and bill daniels
good technicolor adventure from universalinternational directed by anthony mannbr br also starring corinne calvet connie gilchrist and walter brennan as stewart 's sidekick
this firstrate western tale of the gold rush brings great excitement romance and james stewart to the screen
the far country is the only one out of all five stewartmann westerns that is often overlooked
stewart yet again puts a new look on the everpresent personalities he had in the five stewartmann westerns
jeff webster is uncaring always looking out for himself which is why he is so surprised when people are nice and kindly to him
ironically he does wear a bell on his saddle that he will not ride without
this displays that he might just care for one person his sidekick ben tatum played by walter brennan since tatum is the one that gave it to him
mann yet again puts a new look on the ever present personalities he put into the five stewartmann westerns
he displays violence excitement plot twists romance and corruption
the story is that jeff and ben through a series of events wind up in the get rich quick town of dawson along with gold partners calvet and flippen and nogood but beautiful roman and her hired men
they are unable to leave because crooked sheriff mr gannon and his deputies will hang them since the only way out is through skagway which is gannon 's town
but eventually mcintire comes to them but not to collect stewart andor his fine that he supposedly owes to the government
what is mcintire there for
he is there to cheat miners out of their claims and money
people are killed
a sheriff for dawson is considered needed and calvet elects stewart because he is good with a gun
stewart however refuses the job because he plans to get all the gold he can and then pull out
he also refuses it because he does not like to help people since law and order always gets somebody killed
so flippen is elected instead
a miner is killed because he tries to stand up to one of gannon 's men a purely evil mustachioed fancy gunman named madden who carries two guns played by wilke
flippen attempts to arrest madden and see that justice be done but he cannot stand up to him so he becomes the town drunk
a man named yukon replaces flippen
stewart and tatum start to pull out but are ambushed by gannon 's men
tatum is killed and stewart is wounded
stewart finally realizes that he must do something or gannon will take over dawson set up his own rules and it will become his town just like skagway
the audience also realizes what stewart must do
another thing that the audience realizes is that stewart is the only thing that stands between the townspeople and gannon
if stewart leaves gannon would take over the town
if stewart stays and keeps on not doing anything about it the townspeople will be killed one by one mercilessly and uselessly
this is where a great scene occurs
stewart walks into his cabin
he has a sling on his arm
for a few seconds his gun in the gunbelt is hanging on a post beside his bed the gun is close up stewart is in the background just inside the door
he stares at it for a few seconds
he tosses the sling away
the sling lands on the back of a chair and falls to the floor
this is symbolic because he is throwing away his old life which consisted of not caring about anybody but himself
he comes into his new life of helping people when they need help
what ends the film is a gunsblazing furious show of good against evil and a genuinely feelgood feeling that everything will be alright
cunningly interesting western from a director who had few peers in the genre
much like other anthony mann pictures the far country blends a potent pot boiling story with an adroit knowing of impacting scenery
both of which play out amongst some of mann 's peccadilloes like honour integrity betrayal and of course death
the story sees fortune hunting partners jeff webster and ben tatum travel to oregon territory with a herd of cattle
aware of the blossoming goldboom they plan to make a tidy profit selling the cattle in a klondike town
arriving in skagway they find selfappointed judge mr gannon ready to meet out justice to webster on account of webster having fractured the law all be it with honest cause along the way
in punishment gannon takes the partners herd from them but they steal them back and head across the canadian border to dawsonwith gannon and his men in hot pursuit
here beautiful women and a meek and lawless town will fill out the destinies of all involvedbr br interesting from start to finish the far country benefits greatly from james stewart 's bubbling hero in waiting portrayal and mann 's slick direction of the tight borden chase script
the cinematography from william h daniels is superlative tho not done any favours by current dvd prints and the film has a few surprises and a will he wont he
core reeling the viewers in
paying dividends on rewatches for hardened genre fans it still remains something of an essential viewing for first timers venturing into the wonderful yet dark western world of anthony mann and james stewart

jimmy stewart and anthony mann teamed to do some of the best westerns ever made and this is one of the bestbr br the real star of the film however is the spectacular canadian rockies that serve as a backdrop for the story
some of the best cinematography ever done in the history of filmbr br in all five of the westerns that stewart and mann did together the supporting roles were perfectly cast
no exception here right down to parts that might only have a few lines the characters are firmly etched with those linesbr br stewart is a cynical hardbitten loner in this film whose only real friend is his sidekick walter brennan
it 's brennan 's death at the hands of the villains that makes him want to finally free the gold settlement from the bad guys and incidentally redeem himself in the processbr br john mcintire is the head villain of the piece and he was an underappreciated actor with a vast range
he could play delightful old codgers authority figures and in this case a particularly nasty and crafty villain
br br one of the best westerns ever
stewart is a wyoming cattleman who dreams to make enough money to buy a small ranch in utah ranch his only real companion is his sidekick ben tatum the great walter brennan to accomplish that they drive the cattle clear to alaska and on to dawson in canadian territory where they sell them br br along the way they meet the man who runs the goldcrazy town behind a dishonest lawman john mcintire he attempts to steal them the herd later in dawson mcintire and his gang reappear this time interfering with stewart 's gold claim br br captured by mann 's camera in the wonderful scenery of the canadian rockies stewart is a thoughtful loner forced into violence by his need to get rid of the treacherous actions of a corrupt entrepreneur robbing local miners of their claims br br in this entertaining beautiful western stewart has two leading ladies to struggle with ruth roman a bit too valuable to describe as a sexy woman resisting the worst vicissitudes of the territory and the more docile the french canadian girl corinne calvet who does create a nice portrait of a likable girl with the ability to form a judgment in spontaneous manner stewart is lost between the ostentatious saloon owner and the wifecandidate
a river runs through it is based on the true story of two fly fishing brothers norman and paul whose reverend father is a strict man whose two passions are his faith and fly fishing and for him and his sons there is a fine line between the two
this story describes the slow progression of the brothers' lives and how their lives separate on two different paths
it is a touching movie narrated by the director robert redford playing the elderly norman and reflecting on times long gone and people long deadbr br certain themes recur in the movie such as memory death eternity and dreams
most of these themes revolve around the almost tragic hero of paul
he is a capable charming and brave man but has his fatal flawsbr br the closing lines sum up the point of the movie then in the arctic halflight of the canyon all existence fades to a being with my soul and memories and the sounds of the big blackfoot river and a fourcount rhythm and the hope that a fish will rise
eventually all things merge into one and a river runs through it
the river was cut by the world 's great flood and runs over rocks from the basement of time
on some of those rocks are timeless raindrops
under the rocks are the words and some of the words are theirs
i am haunted by waters
embarrassingly i just watched this movie for the first time 13 years after its release
it 's a story that any father or brother can relate to one brother is a bit 'wild' the other brother is the typical older child
craig sheffer is a little too unemotional as the oldest brother but pitt is amazing and skerritt is perfectly cast as the father
the fishing scenes that were filmed in montana are absolutely breathtaking i had no idea that fly fishing could be so attractive
the movie closely follows the book with only a few modifications to make it more appropriate for a movie format
unlike most book to movie stories this one measures up
it 's a perfect movie for anyone who wants a quiet night with a powerful and somewhat emotional movie
in watching how the two brothers interact and feed off of each other through the whole movie makes me personally happy to live in the rural area much like they did in the movie
i have watched this movie countless times and have the book right beside my bible
after watching the movie i agree that this is one of the few movies that does a book justice
i strongly recommend anyone that has the chance to go to montana to fish or be outdoors to do so
it is amazing
i can not think of anyone else that could play the role better than brad pitt
do yourself justice and watch one of the better movies in the modern movie era
strongly recommend and as a guide for fishing trips in both montana and wyoming do not try to learn how to fly fish from the scenes of the movie because although it looks great on the film you have no idea how much practice and skill fishing like that actually takes
thank you for listening watch this movie please if you would like a long sad movie
in answer to the person who made the comment about how the film drags on and who believed there was no purpose to the role of jess 's brother here is my responsebr br the role of jess 's brother is to provide a form of dramatic irony in the story
craig sheffernorman could have foreseen the troubles associated with living life to the full by looking at how jess 's brother turned out
there are various instances where brad pitt and his lives run in parallel for example when jess 's brother takes craig sheffer to a disjointed bar and subsequently he finds brad pitt there a few days later
the dramatic irony was there so craig sheffer 's character would have a bigger emotional turmoil at his brothers death knowing he could have done more to prevent it and subsequently creates a more compelling mood in the film
i 've always enjoyed films that depict life as it is
life sometimes has boring patches no real plot and not necessarily a happy ending
a river runs through it is the perfect name for this film
life ebbs and flows like a river and it has it 's rough spots but it is a wonderful tripbr br robert redford brings a lot to the film
his narration has a friendly feel that fits the picture perfectly
as a director he is restrained and calm and captures some incredibly beautiful scenes
as for the acting craig sheffer and brad pitt work surprising well as brothers
i do n't know quite how to describe tom skerritt and brenda blethyn 's performances except that they truly feel real
a river runs through it is a wonderful filmbr br 86 out of 10
academy award winner robert redford captures the majesty of the montana wilderness and the strength of the american family in this acclaimed adaptation of norman macleans classic memoirbr br craig sheffer stars as the young norman and brad pitt stars as his brother paul an irresistible daredevil driven to challenge the worldbr br growing up both boys rebel against their stern minister father br br while norman channels his rebellion into writing paul descends a slippery path to selfdestructionbr br also starring emily lloyd as wildhearted jessie burnsbr br the film won an academy award for best cinematopghaphy in 1993
great drama with all the areas covered except for screenlay which was too slow and should have shown more relevant scenes like pitt 's character interviewing the presidentor pitt getting murdered instead of just having it described to usscenes like those would have kept the audience awakecutting away some useless minutes could have made more room for more heartpounding scenes like thosethe dragging of the film kept this one from all time greatness although to see pitt here makes the film so worth watchingalsobig fans of fisingearly 20th century styles and montana will really like this as well
this film was just brilliantcastinglocation scenerystorydirectioneveryone 's really suited the part they playedand you could just imagine being thererobert redford 's is an amazing actor and now the same being directornorman 's father came from the same scottish island as myselfso i loved the fact there was a real connection with this filmthe witty remarks throughout the film were greatit was just brilliantso much that i bought the film as soon as it was released for retail and would recommend it to everyone to watchand the flyfishing was amazingreally cried at the end it was so sadand you know what they say if you cry at a film it must have been goodand this definitely was also congratulations to the two little boy 's that played the part 's of norman and paul they were just brilliantchildren are often left out of the praising list i think because the stars that play them all grown up are such a big profile for the whole filmbut these children are amazing and should be praised for what they have done do n't you think
the whole story was so lovely because it was true and was someone 's life after all that was shared with us all
this is one of the most beautiful films i have ever seen
the footage is extraordinary mesmerizing at times
it also received an oscar for best photography and deservedly so
i have many movies in my film collection and several more i 've seen besides them and not many of them are more beautifully or even equally as beautifully shot as this onebr br it 's unique and an overall great movie
the cast is terrific and do a great job in portraying their characters
we follow their destinies with devotion and get very emotionally attached to them
along the way we also learn things about ourselves and our lives
i think much of this film for what it represent and how it present it
i warmly recommend it
there is not much more i can say about this movie than all of the commentaries on page one except as jesse says it 's the berries
all of page one 's commentators wrote eloquently as almost so as the dialog is in this movie
this just may be one of those illusive things we hear so much about but usually are made so by the actors who deliver the lines a beautiful script
maybe robert redford did hold strict sway onto the actorsactresses during the filming of this movie so that the beauty of the story would not get lostbr br i too attended church when i was very young and into my late teens
the church 's pastor spoke very eloquently and quietly as the rev
maclean did in his church
that in itself is a totally different picture that is portrayed of southern baptist churches no holyrollering in my church
it was a big church with many different programs to keep its congregation busy the most inspiring perhaps was the musicdepartment with its huge choir and almost classical anthems
too the sunday eveningcongregation was almost entirely younger people
are you even aware it was once safe to go to church on sunday night
how i wish it still was
watching a river runs through it is very much like going to hear a beautiful sermon in a church whose members are fully involved in life
as has already been so beautifully written the sermon for this movie is the openspace beauties of montana yet are n't there also missilesilos there too
flyfishing or any other activity which draws familymembers closer together for a happy life and deep understanding of one another becomes a blessing
although you see some of the shadier aspects of life then too the simplicity of the story paints a lasting impression on your heart if you let it
speakeasies and prostitutes are counterbalanced by the simple gatherings of oldfashioned community picnics as this movie contains in heavy contrasts to modern families taking their kids to disney land for screeching joyrides and calling it a day together
there is noting wrong with that but as river demonstrates some of its taciturn beauty could do nothing but make life richer
this is the third film i 've seen in which tom skeritt plays a father all different styles and brilliantly actedbr br brad pitt mostly an undiscovered talent except for thelma and louise and meet joe black and all of the castmembers deserved many awards
little stories superbly told will get 10of10 from me over any movie with violence foul language ugliness and action
i am thinking particularly of crash and most of arnold 's movies
what a savior for peace this movie is
in my humble opinion this movie did not receive the recognition it deserved
robert redford lives near me here in provo utah at sundance
i enjoy most of his work and this was my favorite
i'm sorry that more people did n't appreciate it
my grandmother was an avid reader and read the book years before it came out on the big screen
she gave it to me to read after we had seen the movie together
the movie and book hit an emotional spot within my heart and i was weepy for several days after seeing the movie
sometimes love is n't enough to keep our loved ones from hurting themselves
we see this in our own family relationships yet our love and our families and their stories endure throughout generations of time
the cinematography was perfect and breathtaking i was awed by its beauty and how well it brought to life the words of the author of the book norman maclean but when i am alone in the half light of the canyon all existence seems to fade to a being with my soul and memories
and the sounds of the big black foot river and a four count rhythm and the hope that a fish will rise
eventually all things merge into one and a river runs through it
the river was cut by the world 's great flood and runs over rocks from the basement of time
on some of the rocks are timeless raindrops
under the rocks are the words and some of the words are theirs
i am haunted by waters
these words taken from the book and spoken at the end of the movie are basically scripture in my opinion
any possible flaws the movie may have are overshadowed by the beauty and grace of the story and the cinematography
it was beautiful
when i first saw this movie i was with my dad
he encouraged me to watch this movie because it was one of his favorites
after watching the movie it instantly became one of my favorites
br br a river runs through it is about two brothers who each take a different path in life
norman maclean is the older of the two brothers and he is set on the path of education
paul maclean is the rebellious younger brother who travels on a path full of obstacles
the movie follows these characters as the each follow their own pathbr br there is no downside to this movie
you will be entertained the whole way through
the acting directing and script is all perfect
the two things that are exceptional are the cinematography and the score
both of which entrap you in the world robert redford creates for you
br br this is an all around great movie that is destined to be a classic
it sure is in my book
if you have n't seen this movie definitely watch it as soon as you can because it will stay with you forever
a river runs through it is one of those movies that deserves to be seen in the theater so that the majesty of its cinematography can be truly appreciated
the acting is wonderful and understated with every gesture and smile and nod carrying meaning
brad pitt gives a radiant performance and tom skerrit is powerful as the preacher father
the movie moves like a river you have to be willing to follow it through ebbs and flows but it is well worth it in the end
as a habit i always like to read through the 'hated it' reviews of any given movie
especially one that i 'd want to comment on
and it 's not so much a pointcounterpoint sorta deal i just like to see what people say on the flipsidebr br however i do want to address one thing
many people that hated it called it to paraphrase 'beautiful but shallow' some even going so far as to say that norm 's desire yet inability to help his brother was a mundane plot at bestbr br i 'd like to disagreebr br as a brother of a sibling who has a similar dysfunction i can relate
daily you see them abuse themselves knowing only that their current path will inevitably lead them to selfdestruction
and it 's not about the specifics of what they did when how or why paul decided to take up gambling and associating with questionable folks it 's really more how they are wired
on one hand they are veritable geniuses and on the other painfully selfdestructive and all the while you see this you know this and what 's worse you realize you ca n't do a damn thing about itbr br for norman maclean a river runs through it was probably a way to find an answer to why the tragedy had to occur and who was to blame
in the end no one is and often there is no why
but it takes a great deal of personal anguish to truly come to this realization
sometimes it takes a lifetime
and sometimes it never comes at all
in a little town in montana two brothers grow up
one of them is norman the other is paul
their father is reverend maclean and they grow up with his lessons that has to do with religion and the lessons of flyfishing
in this movie flyfishing represents life a littlebr br the story is good and keeps your attention although there are some moments you need a little action
probably the movie has this moments because it is not really about the events that happen but about the message
some things do happen though
norman goes to dartmouth to study
after six years he returns and gets involved with a nice girl named jessie and he is invited to teach in chicago
paul has become a reporter and is known as the fishing reporter
he is famous and it seems he has a nice life but he drinks a little too much and gambles too muchbr br the movie is very well directed it has a nice score and all of the actors are good
the most beautiful thing in this movie is the cinematography
the mountains the woods and the river all look very beautiful
if the movie was only made for these things it was good enough to watch
fortunately there is more
excellent film dealing with the life of an old man as he looks back over the years
starting around 1910 he reminisces about his boy and young adulthood his family friends romances etc
very nostalgic piece with a bittersweet finale all things in life come together as one and a river runs through it
and that river haunts me
worth seeing
upon seeing this film once again it appeared infinitely superior to me this time than the previous times i have viewed it
the acting is stunningly wonderful
the characters are very clearly drawn
brad pitt is simply superb as the errant son who rebels
the other actors and actresses are equally fine in every respect
robert redford creates a wonderful period piece from the days of speakeasies of the 1920s
the scenery is incredibly beautiful of the mountains and streams of western montana
all in all this is one of the finest films made in the 1990sbr br you must see this moviebr br
the combination of reading the novella and viewing this film has inspired my wife and i to new levels
recently i was pondering a statement made by the artist thomas kinkade in one of his inspirational books he states you and i were not designed to breathe the fetid air of five o'clock traffic
nor do i think god had banal television programs media hype worthless purchases and soul pollution in mind when he created the universe i had n't seen a river runs through it in a couple of years but after pondering kinkade 's statement something drew me to watch the film with a spiritual eye
i watched it and saw a whole new world to the film and it inspired me to read the book
i have always been frustrated in southern california but somehow got caught up in its materialistic society
the film really puts into perspective of how we should really experience god 's creations
a combination of macleans story and my desire to move back to the northwest has driven me to move to montana
i want my future kids to be able to rome the landscape go flyfishing with me ride horses into nothing but open land and serene lakes set in the mountainside
a place where you seldom worry about crime
i look around socal and all i see is shopping malls rude snarling people in their mercedez bens miles of vehicles on congested freeways gangs racial turmoil on the verge of violent eruption and everyone skeptical of each others intentionsbr br anyway the movie is very inspiring with brilliant acting and a deep story about the fragile connections of loved ones
there is a lot of deep thinking in this film
the scenery is worth seeing alone and actually helps relieve tension
you should finish this film relaxed yet full of insights to your own life
it takes a compassionate intelligent and spiritual person to really grasp the meaning
if you do n't understand the art of cinema and how a director achieves his goals through dialogue tone light colour scenery camera anglesmovement etc
then this film is probably not for the crowd that thinks the fast and the furious is the greatest film
granted it was entertaining but shallowbr br the bottom line this film helps to realize that life is not about how much money you have or what things you posses
rather it is about your relationships with family and friends and the experiences you share together
quality not qauntity
one of the things about the film that warmed my heart strings was that dry fly fishing was a major part of the scene
i have occasionally carried out my times of dry fly fishing having tied my own flies and being accompanied by my brother and my father we spend a day on one river or another seeking to tempt the ever elusive brown trout to rise and take the fly that has been offered to thembr br when we had occasions like this any differences between us disappeared and any of the pressures of the world melted away to be replaced by the glory of being absorbed in the activity and the surroundings of the place we were inbr br this was one of the amazing things that was portrayed to me in the film as the minister and his two sons norman and pauly carried out the ritual
for there is something ritualistic about fly fishing as there is something ritualistic about so many pastimes
you ca n't just start casting your fishing line and hope for the best
you have to attune yourself to the place you are in you have to scan the surface of the water considering how it is flowing and where the best point might be to place your fly and depending on your skill level you might even get your fly to land there long enough for a fish to take note of it and strike
the 'art of flyfishing' was directed and represented so well that they themselves can be classified as artistsbr br the title for the film could not be more aptly chosen for the river did in fact run through the life of father and two sons
this film however spreads itself broader than the family and community in montana by the the blackfoot river where the film is played out
it has the capacity to draw you in to enthrall you to capture you as the history of the family community and period is unfolded
the story told is not just a family history but a history of life
what may be classified as a 'river of life'
i have seen all the films directed by robert redford and appreciated his love of the american people and the land
in a river runs through it redford displays the lyric romanticism and visual splendor of the high rocky mountains of montana as if he were a 19th century landscape painter of the ilk of thomas moran or albert bierstadt
this film makes love to the visual and the word with text by author norman maclean and stunning camera work by phillippe rousselot br br redford 's cast is perfect
tom skerritt is the rev
maclean a man whose methods of education include fly fishing as well as the bible brenda blythen the mother and his sons craig schaffer and brad pitt create a family whose interactions reflect the same problems all encounter with growing teenage sons and later complex young men
both schaffer and pitt are totally believable as the brothers whose love of fly fishing and each other will tie them together forever
it is the relationships between men father and sons brothers and their women to the outside world that grounds a river runs through it to a vein of storytelling that is missing in so many of hollywood films produced in recent yearsbr br what makes these relationships special however is the attention redford gives to the language as spoken in dialogue
this is a literate script beautiful to hear and unforgettable when coupled with the stunning montana rivers and mountains
the words and setting are equal to performances by a cast that rises to their material
while the idea of fly fishing may seem an odd device to center a story it is not so implausible in redford 's directorial hands
given the material redford 's ode to a simpler time and life is worth revisiting again and again
have you seen the graduate
it was hailed as the movie of its generation
but a river runs through it is the story about all generations
long before dustin hoffman 's character got all wrapped up in the traps of modern suburbia norman maclean and his brother paul were facing the same crushing pressures of growing up as they tried to find their place in the world
but how could a place like post ww1 montana be a showcase for the american family at a time when the wild west still was not completely gone
just what has maclean tapped into that strikes so deeply at who we all are and what we have to go through to find ourselves
as the movie opens norman is an old man flyfishing beside a rushing river trying to understand the course his own life has taken
the movie is literally a journey up through his own stream of consciousness against time 's current and back to when he was a boy
he and his younger brother paul were the sons of a presbyterian minister and devoted mother
the parents fit snugly into their roles
mom takes care of house and home
dad does the work of the lord
the boys ponder what they will be when they grow up
norm has it narrowed down to a boxer or a minister like his dad
given the choice little paul would be the boxer since he 's told his first choice of pro flyfisherman does n't even exist
the boys grow up and get into trouble with their pranks fight to see who is tougher and do the things brothers do all the while attending church and taking part in all other spiritual matters like flyfishing
they are at similar points in their lives before college
but when norm returns from his six years at dartmouth things are very different
paul is at the top of his game
master flyfisherman
grad of a nearby college and newspaper reporter who knows every cop on the beat and every judge on the bench
norman is stunningly well educated for his day but has little idea what to do with his life even as his father grills him about what he intends to do
you 're left feeling that at least to pops god will call you to your life 's work
but you have to stay open and ready to receive it all your life
father has always taken his boys to reflect by the side of the river and contemplate god 's eternal words
listen their father urges
it 's both zen and quakerly
pretty radical for a stoic clergyman
but with all the beauty and contemplation and even though the macleans are truly a godfearing scriptureheeding household how is it that rev
maclean 's family is unraveling
paul is true perfection as he fishes the river but he 's feeling the pull of gambling and boozing while his family does n't know how to keep him from winding up where he seems to be headed
mom dad and brother all seem to have the same quiet desperation of not knowing what they should be doing and why they ca n't seem to help
pauly just waves it all off with a grin and his irresistible charm
but the junior brother is losing his grip
norman starts getting his life on track finding love and career but paul continues to slide
the family that loves him watches helplessly
mother father brother flounder in their own ways trying to help but none very effectively
how can a family that loves each other so much be so illequipped to handle this
how can someone be so artful and full of grace when out in god 's nature yet be somehow unfit or unwilling to fit into the constructs of society that god 's peoples have made for themselves
these are all questions norman will ponder his entire life
the eternal words beneath the smooth stones of the river forever haunt him yet keep their secrets
the movie is beautiful to watch
this is certainly god 's country and filming it won an oscar
director robert redford plays with the story from the book and teases the narration a bit to follow the emotional pattern he 's presenting and it works well
but do go back and read the book too
you 'll see norman made connections with his old man even deeper than the movie can suggest and you 'll see the places where the storyteller 's very words gurgle and sing right off the page with an exuberance of a river running through it leading into the unknown
i have read the short story by norman maclean and the movie did justice to norman maclean 's writing
my husband tends to reread it occasionally and i myself have read it over and scenes of the movie keeps coming to mind
we have videos of many of redford s movies and we have watched a river runs through it many times
redford is part of the famdamily as he is always around
we never get tired of redford 's perception of norman maclean writings and the beauty of montana
the script reminds me very much of my own upbringing as my father had the same calling as mr maclean 's father
according to a river runs through it methodists are baptists who can read a line which by the way is not in the short story but i think that is a funny line
my husband and i are wellread baptistsbr br i have heard a movie critic state that the pace of this movie is too slow
i disagree
as one search for inner peace this is the type of movie that will make you contemplate the beauty of nature in threefour rhythm of the metronome
the photography is outstanding
the acting is great
i love the scene where norman and paul as boys talked and wondered whether one could be a fly fisher or a boxer
then as adult paul played by brad pitt is the perfect guy who needs help with his alcoholism but will not accept it
the same applies to neal burns who uses worms as bait he also needed help but would not accept the fact that he needed help
the scene where paul refuses to eat oatmeal and the entire family has to wait an eternity to say grace
finally after hours they all kneel around the table to say grace
and they all leave
but the oatmeal stayed on the plate
that scene where the two love birds and their tattoos on their posteriors
that is funny
the sunburn
the drive back home where jessie burns decides to go via the train line
beautiful dialogue when norman proposes to jessie because he wants her to come to chicago with himbr br redford himself does a superb job as a narrator
i could not stop myself from comparing brad to the young redford
the nominated director producer actor is a visionary who deserves to be praised for his advancement not only in the cinema in the us but around the world
i am glad to live in nineteen hundred because i have seen the beginning of the black and white television the movies and all the technology and special effects to be able to watch videos at home and to live in the same century as redford because i have had the chance to see his works
redford needs no special effects to show us the beauty of montana in this masterpiece
the river to me means that line that separates life from death memories and realities
redford shows the hands of the creator so magnificently and a river runs through it
a stunning realization occurs when some sort of phenomenon takes place
be it firecrackers going off witnessing a robbery a hurricane nonchalantly devastating everything in it 's path or for that matter any other spectacular occurrence
in the case of the maclean family however reveille was something which was no more complex than their day to day lives montana in the early twentieth century was an environment which was rough and tumble the maclean family was comprised of four people the father a minister who was ideologically driven to raise his family properly
his wife was god fearing and dutiful
the two boys were well
boys
what else can you say
brad pitt starred in this film before he was really the
brad pitt and his acting performance in this film was to say the least remarkable
his brother norman was the cerebral type he was touched by emotions that were genuine and motivated by a set of values that missoula montana concurred with
paul was a misfit from the offset and lived on the edge you would think that montana in the 1920 's had no such thing yet somehow gambling drinking and violent confrontations were as much a part of paul as was his fly fishing rod
fly fishing
did i say that
parenthetically this was the core of this movie 's theme
the recreation of fly fishing served as the cohesive bond which homogenized the kindred spirits of the maclean brothers and to a lesser degree the father
i would describe the acting in this film as incredibly believable and the cinematography went beyond sensational put it this way anyone who sees this film will want to live in montana breathtaking filmography of bluer than blue mountains and streams captured the youth and effervescence that the maclean brothers had for life seldom in a film do you witness whereby feelings immediately invoke a dogged tenacity to accomplish whatever it may be that someone wishes to accomplish the maclean brothers lived life to the fullest and for better or worse the father knew that this was going to be the only way the two of them could become men
robert redford directs this film and tells the story of the maclean 's through the perspective of the older brother norman norman gets offered a position at the university of chicago at age 26 and marries the woman he will always be in love with what this film also points out is that the younger brother paul has attained an accomplishment of his own by being the epitome of a remarkable fly fisherman
the seedier side of life prevails in the younger brother 's existence and exerts an insidious form of consternation for the maclean family
as most human shortcomings go the maclean family made light of turbulent waters and thus established unity as a family by putting necessary blinders on
br br the end of the movie river runs through it presents an epigram of life through the eyes of the older brother for norman maclean stoicism is a prerequisite to perseverance in his emeritus years
such a fate is largely due to the fact that reflecting on his life is tantamount to yearning for people who have passed away
the fond memories of his brother his wife his mother and his father must now be viewed philosophically
for norman his life has been relegated to stubborn facts that have determined his dubious outlook and precarious resolve
something as simple as the statement this was your life and that is how you lived it is a somber recollection of the joy the sorrow the regrets and the love he gave as well as was the recipient of
best put in the last sermon he heard his father give his father said we can completely love someone without completely understanding them whether you agree with what has happened in your life or not it happened nonetheless
norman maclean must come to grips with the fact that his life has been fragmented by misunderstandings
norman maclean has become a decrepit octogenarian who is polarized by virtual conclusions to his life
the murky waters of montana 's picturesque rivers serve as a vicious and desultory finalization to his years on earth
without question the very prolific statement of what seems complicated is really very simple purveys a very acrimonious message in this movie more simply put the people and places which were important in norman 's life are now only a bittersweet memory merely a painfully intellectual rumination of events which are aggravated by the haunted waters of montana 's beautiful streams and rivers to which for the entire maclean family all things merge into one and a river runs through it
in arlington heights il we never had a cafeteria in any of the elementary schools so i rode my bike home from school for lunch and always watched this game
true i was 11 but i thought it was the greatest thing on
i 'd draw hidden pictures on my blackboard and see if my family or friends could find it
i also remember winning wonderful cars if the contestant got the final hidden picture game
i even had the home versionbr br i wonder why this game lasted so briefly
i enjoyed the music and the hidden pictures the only one i could ever get was the lemon hidden as part of a bridge over a garden streambr br really good memories are connected with camouflage
this game show lasted just one season but was intriguing to audiences because it required visual aptitude and a steady hand
one false move would disqualify the contestant from winning the prize even though it was clear the contestant knew the correct answer
it was always exciting as the contestant began drawing wondering if they would complete the drawing or be buzzed out allowing the other contestant to easily win the contest
it was a lighthearted show but it was clear that the contestants were often times embarrassed from a silly mistake made unintentionally
rarely seen the game show did not survive past one single season
only a seasoned game show addict will remember this show as it proved to be quite unpopular even though game shows were making a big return to the tv screen after the scandals of the 1950 's game shows
but it was a unique concept for a game show and one that has as yet never been seen again
13 days to glory tells the traditional tale with sympathy toward the mexican viewpoint
the major problem in this movie was that while cowboy actor james arness played the part of jim bowie persuasively the rest of the name actors in the cast brian keith and lorne greene were too oldbr br raul julia played general antonio lopez de santa anna with grace and dignity owed to the professional soldier who after all won the battle
the scene where he upbraids his officers for failing to mount a guard and prevent a sortee is one the scriptwriters did not understand
failing to keep watch is a major remiss in the military
santa anna was within his prerogatives to be angry
raul julia magnificently carried poor writing through the scenebr br kathleen york was an impressive susannah dickinson a woman who deserves to be remembered for her courage
however kathleen york might have been reminded that as dickinsons hailed from pennsylvania they probable dis not sound very southron
when john wayne filmed his alamo story he had built a complete alamo set in the town of brackettsville texas which is still there and quite the tourist attraction
as long as that stands we will have a set for future alamo interpretations for the screen
one such with dennis quaid and billy bob thornton was done in this centurybr br but i would say the alamo thirteen days to glory is the best alamo story filmed i 've seen
john wayne 's film is a good one if overhyped but it 's a john wayne film with the story redone to fill parameters of screen character of john wayne
brian keith plays davy crockett here and gives a fine interpretation of the rollicking frontier character he wasbr br it 's a lot closer to professor lon tinkle 's book on the alamo than the wayne film was and having read the book years ago i can attest to that
tinkle 's book is listed as the source in both films but tinkle who was alive back then when the wayne film was done and he was not pleased with the resultbr br alec baldwin was around the right age for young william barrett travis the idealistic freedom fighter who incidentally was a slave owner
back in the day no one saw the ironic contradiction in that
one thing that was not explored and has n't been was travis 's hyperactive sex drive
he was the casanova of the southwest he even kept a salacious diary of his libidinal conquestsbr br but the man who always gets the whitewash is jim bowie played here by james arness
he was a hero at the alamo to be sure but his career before the alamo was that of a scoundrel
he was a smuggler a slave trader an all around con man selling land he had questionable title to
but his heroic death certainly redeemed him
no hint of that is in arness 's portrayal nor any others i 've seen of bowie on the screen
and of course he did design the bowie knife done to his specifications
that man needed such a weaponbr br however the main asset that the alamo thirteen days to glory has is a full blown portrayal of antonio de lopez de santa anna the president of mexico who comes up personally to put down the rebellion stirred up by the north americans who 've come to settle in texas at mexican invitation
unfortunately those americans came with some preconceived notions about liberty that just had n't made it that far south at least liberty for white people
raul julia plays santa anna who remains an even more controversial figure in mexican history
he was also quite the scoundrel but he was the best mexico produced until a genuine reformer named benito juarez came alongbr br this film was the farewell performance of lorne greene who appears briefly as general sam houston
greene 's not quite my conception of houston he really was way too old for the part houston was in his early forties in 1836 he was not yet the patriarch of texas
but within the limits imposed on him greene does a fine jobbr br for a romantic telling of the alamo tale by all means see john wayne 's version but for historical content i recommend this film highly
this made for television version of the legendary stand against hopeless odds is more objective more realistic than earlier filmed versions of the events though the one movie made after this went perhaps too far in humanizing the figures of sam houston bowie travis and crockettbr br the focus here is on jim bowie played with sharp cynical detachment by james arness who is apparently still alive at age 85 then 65 he made a comeback to acting after years away from the screen to do this partbr br puerto ricanborn raul julia humanizes gen santa ana as no one since j carol naish back in '54 had done
however the mexican dictator is portrayed as a lecherous vainglorious popinjaygaudier uniforms have never been seen before or since
he receives excellent advice from the european officers he has hired but convinced of his own infallibility he does not heed itbr br alec baldwin is the one actor whose age is appropriate to the character he plays col william travis
his portrayal is earnest
he is almost in awe of the older men who share command with himbr br the one jarring note was brian keith as crockett
in a coonskin cap and carrying ol' betsy he stumbles about as if he had wandered in from another movie
with no conviction in the portrayal the character is reduced to a few stage conventions
br br the script reveals some historical facts overlooked or suppressed in earlier film versions
we learn that jim bowie was in the person of santa ana fighting his own brotherinlaw
the mexican soldiers performed poorly in part because they were armed with rifles left over from the napoleonic wars a generation earlier
santa ana likes a bargain
bowie wryly explains
the whole project of defending the former spanish mission as a fort was militarily ill adviseda fact explored in greater depth in the 2004 film the alamo
the best film on the battle of san antonio texas in march 1836 was john wayne 's 1960 epic the alamo
in a one shot job as director producer that temporarily financially strapped him wayne demonstrated that he was talented in movie making outside of his iconlike acting ability personifying the westbr br i have commented on that film in a review the other night and i pointed out that wayne and james edward grant tackled some points that were barely mentioned in earlier films about the battle
they did bring in the issue of slavery
they also finally discussed the contribution of local mexican land owner juan seguin as an important leader in the war for independence on par with crockett bowie travis austin and houston
br br but there was one weakness in the film
wayne worked hard to cast it properly thinking of many people for lead roles in it
but he did not properly handle the leader of the enemy forces general antonio de santa anna
the role was played by an obscure actor ruben padilla
padilla did not have any spoken dialog
and while he does have one of the last shots in the film he just is shown as a silent tyrant observing the burning of the bodies of the americans and their alliesbr br despite several poor choices in the casting of this television movie it is the best film in showing the man who was a leading bogeyman to american policy makers
raul julia was a wonderful stage actor
i was fortunate to see him in a production of arms and the man in manhattan as sergius
he was never boring and usually first rate in his actingbr br here we see the egotistical monster at his worst
nothing is acceptable that does not fit santa anna 's wishes or activities
it can be the failure of an orderly in the army to bring some item he requested fast enough or it can be the temerity of these foreign brigands in not knuckling down to himself the napoleon of the westbr br santa anna was president of mexico five or six times between 1830 and 1855 he claimed that he first got involved in overthrowing a president because that president did not live up to the country 's constitution but it was the power that kept him going year after year
it is a sad commentary that he was the leading mexican historical figure in those two decades
no political figure or military figure would rise to override him until benito juarez did in the late 1850s
initially he claimed great liberal ideals but he once admitted that the people of mexico were children who needed guidance for one hundred years before they could rule themselves
the amazing thing about him was he managed to keep coming back
his policies were disasters
while we know about his attack on texas he also tried to expand into guatamala
he did win at the alamo but at great cost of lives
his massacre of col fannin 's men at goliad was inexcusable
then came the disaster of san jacinto where his army was wiped out
he was captured and humiliated and forced to sign a surrender of texas
houston was kind to him the troops wanted to string him upbr br except for losing a leg in a battle against the french in 1838 he managed not to get wounded in most of his wars
he repudiated the forced surrender of texas but could not militarily undue it
instead he would lead mexico into defeat in the war of 1846 48 against the americans leading to the mexican session
the us was decent enough to pay mexico 15000000 for the southwest but mexico lost half of it 's territory
he would be president for the last time in 1853 in time to give franklin pierce 's horrendously bad administration it 's one moment of glory santa anna sold the border of arizona and new mexico to the us no other mexican president ever cost his country so much
he was exiled in 1855 and settled in staten island
there he managed to do his most creative work he introduced chicle to the us and it became chewing gum
some achievement
br br julia 's santa anna is younger than the practiced cynic and schemer who became america 's best land purchase agent
he is not going to stand for opposition and he jumps into furious tantrums at a moment 's notice
most of the time his chief aide col black holds his tongue he does not wish to be in front of a firing squad as he could be
but stiers is secretly less than enchanted by his boss
at the end when alone with the newly widowed wives of the dead alamo defenders stiers suggests that they tell the world what santa anna is really like
and they did
heres a fun fact i was the baby in the movie the one in the crib
i am 19 years old now
my parents took me to try out for the part we lived in texas at the timei think i only made like 80 bucks for it but i was n't in it very long
my parents said i would cry when i was supposed to be happy and would be happy when i was supposed to cry
i was all mixed up
strange and funny fact i suppose and no i am not a child actress
i am livin' in san antonio workin' at a walgreens
i graduated here in texas but i lived in maryland most my life
this movie is a great movie though good concept
i have seen it several times in my short 19 years
i thoroughly enjoyed this movie because there was a genuine sincerity in the acting
the writing was topnotch
james arness is a great actor and he showed it here
brian keith was too old to be davy crockett and can anyone really play davy but fess parkerbr br another great actor in this move was raul julia who gave depth to santa anna a vain and complex person who led mexico through turbulent timesbr br while some may think the movie was slowpaced it captured the battle as it unfolded lots of tedium followed by a couple hours of horrific terrorbr br what impressed me most about this movie is that it made you think about a cause and how some people are willing to die for what they believe in
in this day and age when nobody stands for anything i found it refreshing to think that there was a time when people died for freedom no matter how you may feel about the politics of the time
michael bowen plays an innocentish young man who hitchhikes a thousand miles to visit his absentee millionaire father at a sprawling windmillpowered ranch and ends up tangled in the dangerous web of his young scheming and seductive stepmother from hell thus causing trouble for the already dysfunctional family
an edgy stylish and exciting drama that received no promotion and was sent straight to vhs and cable tvwhere i first saw it
it is beautifully written smartly acted and tightly directed from a script that keeps you biting your nails
i cannot believe the reviewers who disliked it ever actually saw it
it is an undiscovered classic
i was surprised at the low rating this film got from viewers
i saw it one late night on tv and it hit the spot i actually think it was back in 1989 when it first appeared
yet i remember it pretty well with a nice twist or two and an interesting ambiance on a windmill farm
michael pollard looks suitably seedy for his role which pretty much sums up the unfulfilled early promise of his career and everyone else plays it pretty straight ahead
i definitely recommend it as a rental although some of the themes which might have seemed a bit edgy in 1989 now may seem tame which is a shame considering that contemporary edginess is often just used as a necessary marketing tool sort of like clamoring just to get noticed
i have never danced flamenco before but somehow i feel like this movie was perfect
the colors how blatant the dances were the gypsies and the rivals all put together made a movie that seemed to have ended too soon
i have seen other carlos saura movies and i agree that this film may be his best production
i feel that the best characteristics of his past films were put together and aligned to make iberia
i appreciate the use of mirrors in revealing the activity going on behind the cameras
while watching this movie i felt like i was sitting in a small restaurant in madrid comfortably watching the dancers bang on a wooden plank over a delicious fruit cocktail
for me this movie fit like a glove
i do n't know how i will be able to get a copy of this film in the us in the next few years
i recommend this movie to anyone who is attracted to the livelihood of other cultures
it is safe to say that this movie is certainly on my favorites list
the music of albeniz pervades this film
once and a while it is played with original instrumentation but often it is reworked with various contemporary ensembles and treatments
only occasionally is the music the sole focus of the film the vast majority of the time the music is set to various dances often flamenco but not always
i would guess that there are 1214 scenes which are not united by a plot
not all scenes will reach the heights for an individual viewer
in my case about half reached the pinnacle though all the rest were in their own way very fine
those that worked for me moved me to gooseflesh aesthetic delight indeed the final scene left me weepy with joy
and in some very magical way it brings you deep into spanish culture
if you do n't like subtitles do n't worry
the film is virtually wordless though each scene carries a title of an albeniz piece
seeing this very beautiful film sharpens my complaint that virtually none of the films of saura are available on dvd in the usa
i am thinking here particularly of his flamenco version of carmen a spectacular work of art that is available in europe but not here
this is a scandal
saturday june 3 630pm the neptunebr br monday june 5 430pm the neptunebr br few celebrations of ethnic and cultural identity succeed as mightily as carlos saura 's brilliant interpretation of isaac albeniz' masterpiece iberia suite
at the approach of its centennial saura drew together an unprecedented wealth of talent from the spanish performing arts community to create this quintessential love song to their homeland
the twelve impressions of the suite are presented without narrative in stark surroundings allowing the power of each performance to explode before saura 's camera
creative use of large flats and mirrors moved throughout the set combined with screens shadows fire rain and rear projection add glorious dramatic effects to the varied selections of song dance and instrumental performance
photographs of albeniz reappear throughout the program connecting the passion of the music to its great creator
saura encompasses all spaniards on his stage from the beautiful elegance of elderly flamenco dancers in traditional costume to children joyously dancing with their instructors
if saura had n't done anything like this before iberia would be a milestone
now it still deserves inclusion to honor a great director and a great cinematic conservator of spanish culture but he has done a lot like this before and though we can applaud the riches he has given us we have to pick and choose favorites and high points among similar films which include blood wedding carmen el amore brujo sevillanas salom and tango
i would choose saura 's 1995 flamenco as his most unique and potent cultural document next to which iberia palesbr br iberia is conceived as a series of interpretations of the music of isaac manuel francisco albniz and in particular his iberia suite for piano
isaac albniz was a great contributor to the externalization of spanish musical culture its reformatting for a nonspanish audience
he moved to france in his early thirties and was influenced by french composers
his iberia suite is an imaginative synthesis of spanish folk music with the styles of liszt dukas and d'indy
he traveled around performing his compositions which are a kind of beautiful standardization of spanish rhythms and melodies not as homogenized as ravel 's bolero but moving in that direction
naturally the spanish have repossessed albniz and in iberia the performers reinterpret his compositions in terms of various more ethnic and regional dances and styles
but the source is a tamed and diluted form of spanish musical and dance culture compared to the echt spanishness of pure flamenco
flamenco coming out of the region of andalusia is a deeply felt amalgam of gitane hispanoarabic and jewish cultures
iberia simply is the peninsula comprising spain portugal andorra and gibraltar the very concept is more diluted
br br saura 's flamenco is an unstoppably intense ethnic mix of music singing dancing and that peacock manner of noble preening that is the essence of spanish style the way a man and a woman carries himself or herself with pride verging on arrogance and elegance and panache even bullfights and the moves of the torero are full of it in a series of electric sequences without introduction or conclusion they just are
saura always emphasized the staginess of his collaborations with choreographer antonio gades and other artists
in his 1995 flamenco he dropped any pretense of a story and simply has singers musicians and dancers move on and off a big sound stage with nice lighting and screens flats and mirrors arranged by cinematographer vittorio storaro another of the spanish filmmaker 's important collaborators
the beginnings and endings of sequences in flamenco are often rough but atmospheric marked only by the rumble and rustle of shuffling feet and a mixture of voices
sometimes the film keeps feeding when a performance is over and you see the dancer bend over sigh or laugh or somebody just unexpectedly says something
in flamenco more than any of saura 's other musical films it 's the rapt intense interaction of singers and dancers and rhythmically clapping participant observers shouting impulsive ol 's that is the story and creates the magic
because saura has truly made magic and perhaps best so when he dropped any sort of conventional storybr br iberia is in a similar style to some of saura 's purest musical films no narration no dialogue only brief titles to indicate the type of song or the region beginning with a pianist playing albeniz 's music and gradually moving to a series of dance sequences and a little singing
in flamenco music the fundamental element is the unaccompanied voice and that voice is the most unmistakable and unique contribution to world music
it relates to other songs in other ethnicities but nothing quite equals its raw raucous unique uglybeautiful cry that defies you to do anything but listen to it with the closest attention
then comes the clapping and the foot stomping and then the dancing combined with the other elements
there is only one flamenco song in iberia
if you love saura 's flamenco you 'll want to see iberia but you 'll be a bit disappointed
the style is there some of the great voices and dancing and music are there
but iberia 's source and conception doom it to a lesser degree of power and make it a less rich and intense cultural experience
i have seen a lot of saura films and always found amazing the way he assembles music dance drama and great cinema in his movies
ibria shows an even better saura dealing with multimedia concepts and a more contemporary concept of dance and music
another thing that called my attention is the fact that in this movie dancers and musicians dance and music are equally important the camera shows various aspects of music interpretation examining not only technical issues but also the emotional experience of playing
the interest of saura on the bridge between classical and contemporary music and dance is one more ingredient in turning this movie maybe the most aesthetically exciting among his other works
that 's why i recommend it strongly to those who love good cinema good music good dance great art
maybe i loved this movie so much in part because i 've been feeling down in the dumps and it 's such a lovely little fairytale
whatever the reason i thought it was pitch perfect
great intelligent story beautiful effects excellent acting
this movie made me happier than i 've been for a whilebr br it is a very funny and clever movie
the running joke of the kingdom 's history of prince savagery and the aftermath the way indulging in magic effects the witch and dozens of smart little touches all kept me enthralled
that 's much of what makes it so good it 's an elaborate specialeffectsladen movie with more story than most fairytale movies yet there is an incredible attention to small thingsbr br i feel like just going ahead and watching it all over again
going into seeing this movie i was a bit skeptical because fantasy movies are not always my cup of tea
especially a romantic fantasybr br little did i know that i was in for a ride through cinematic magic
everything in the movie from plot to dialogue to effects was very near perfectionbr br claire danes shines like the star she is in this movie
from beginning to end you fall more and more in love with this characterbr br michelle pfeiffer is menacing as an evil witch bent on capturing the star for eternal youth and beautybr br robert de niro is a lovable character who gives the audience the greatest bit of comic relief as the movie is gaining momentum towards the climaxbr br overall this was a movie that surprised and delighted me as a movie fan
if you are looking for a fun and enjoyable movie that will be fun for the kids and adults alike stardust is the way to go
highly enjoyable very imaginative and filmic fairytale all rolled into one stardust tells the story of a young man living outside a fantasy world going inside it to retrieve a bit of a fallen star only to find the star is alive young and beautiful
a kingdom whose king is about to die has said king unleash a competition on his several sons to see who can retrieve a ruby first to be king whilst a trio of witches want the star to carve up and use to keep them young
these three plot threads weave intricately together throughout the entire picture blended with good acting dazzling special effects and some solid sentiment and humour as well
stardust is a fun film and has some fun performances from the likes of claire danes as the star to michelle pfeiffer playing the horrible witch to robert deniro playing a nancyboy air pirate to perfection
charlie cox as the lead tristan is affable and credible and we get some very good work from a group of guys playing the sons out to be king who are constantly and consistently trying to kill off each other
mark strong jason flemyng and ruppert everett plays their roles well in both life and death
peter o'toole plays the dying killer daddy and watch for funny man ricky gervais who made me laugh more than anything in the entire film in his brief five minutes
but the real power in the film is the novel by neil gaiman and the script made from his creative and fertile mind
stardust creates its own mythology and its own world and it works
although stardust seems to be a fantasy film with predictable ending and average performances it is certainly not
when i saw the movie i knew it was going to be one of my favorite movies
and i was right
br br stardust is more of a fairytale than an adventure film
it has this magical 'aura' from the beginning to the very end of the movie
the storyline is well written and it keeps you on the edge of your seat
like every tale it has some short of morality
therefore we know in our hearts that the evil brothers wo n't take the throne but the innocent boy who manages to overcome every obstacle and difficulty he encounters during his journey
we also know that the true love is yvaine and not victoria the material girl who is shallow and manipulative
br br i have to give extra credits to claire danes
she literally shines in this movie
her eyes have this sparkle that fit totally in her character
moreover she and cox do have chemistry which makes the romance in the film even more notable
the rest of the cast are well known actors and actresses which of course make stardust an interesting and ''high classed'' moviebr br overall the movie is fantastic the locations magical and the plot interestingi was very disappointed that the film did n't get nominated for more awards
i have to give at least 910 stars for this
i contend that whoever is ultimately responsible for creatingapproving the trailer for this movie has completely blundered
no one i know wanted to see this movie based on the previews and everyone who actually saw it absolutely loved it the advertising campaign is disgracedisasterblunderbr br opened at behind br br rush hour which i have not seen average imdb score of 74br br the bourn ultimatum which i have seen awesome movie but 3rd week out average imdb score of 87 br br the simpsons movie which i have seen okay movie but 4th week out average imdb score of 81 br br stardust average imdb score of 84 br br whether it was poor scheduling or poor advertising i think that the powers that be behind this movie screwed up big time
this should have been advertised as an amazing movie that happens to be a fantasyfairytale and not advertised as just another fairytale too bad anyway now that i have very pointlessly ranted onandon awesome movie go see it
this remarkable film can be summed up very easily
first of all while the comparisons to princess bride are inevitable it 's almost futile to do so
while both films combine adult wit and humor with a fairy tale backdrop stardust is so much different than any other fantasyscifi film i 've ever seen
it 's such a hybrid of those genres but its plot and script are so unique thatalong with the performances special effects cinematography and scorethe finished product is simply not all that comparable to anything that has ever appeared on the silver screen
secondly the score is very effective at simultaneously pulling us into the story and the fantasy world in which it takes place and pushing the story along while creating just the right amount of awe and excitement necessary to make the magic believable within the realm where the characters exist
thirdly i did not find the film to be even remotely difficult to follow or confusing in any way
in fact the interesting interplay between the three main subplots actually made it even that much more compelling to watch
wonderfully casted and superbly acted across the board
this fantasy adventure was the best one i 've seen since return of the king
ok so its not that easy to sum up but do n't let any crude andor heartless and cynical review nor the film 's pathetic pr prevent you from partaking in the best time you could have at the movies this summer
please future writers producers directors learn from this moviebr br never before have i seen such a bold and original tale created for the big movie screen
bold because the script constantly made a step so many fantasy movies safely avoided a step to something new creative and daring
just when you think 'oh i 've seen this before' or 'i am sure this is what will happen now' stardust would make an unexpected twist and involve you more and more into the storybr br the actors are great even the smallest part is performed with such talent it fills me with awe for the creators of this movie
robert de niro is gorgeous and performs with such energy that he simply steals the show in each scene he 's in
michelle pfeiffer is the perfect witch and claire danes a wonderful choice for the innocent and loving 'star' yvaine
other big names make outstanding roles
i had the filling everyone is trying to give his best for this movie
but once again the story by neil gaiman all the little things he 'invented' for this universe simply outstandingbr br i watched this movie at a prescreening today a day before the official release and do hope it will have huge success
there is so much humor but also tense moments as well as lovely tender scenes
the look in the eyes of yvaine the 'frivolities' of captain shakespeare the passion of lamia the witch impressive unforgettablebr br for me this is the number one entertaining movie of 2007 watch it and enjoy itbr br 1110 outstandingbr br peace and love
what a wonderful fanciful movie stardust isbr br i could easily end it with that one statement and suffice to say one could take it as a very strong recommendation to go see itbr br at a time when hollywood seems bent on forcing remakes and sequels down our throats stardust makes us remember why we go to the movies in the first place to escape reality for a couple of hours and explore other lives other times or other planets
ironically stardust takes us to all three places effortlessly and with a childlike glee we all long forbr br stardust is full of all the characters we remember as children princes witches pirates ghosts and scoundrels
it has the damsel in distress the hero the rogues the obstacles spells antidotes charms and even a touch of lightspeed to make it quasi modernbr br stardust is about a man from the town of wall which is conveniently situated next to a wall that separates their town from a magical kingdom
the only way past the wall is through a breech that is diligently guarded by a scruffy old codger
one day a young man from wall named ben barnes out maneuvers the old guard and escapes through the breech
he happens upon an enchanted kingdom called stormhold where he meets a chained young lady named una
she is held captive by a witch and leashed by an unbreakable chain
while the witch is away una seduces ben and sends him on his way
ben returns to wall without incident and continues his life
but nine months later he is summoned to the wall breech where the old guard hands him what you might expect a baby boybr br the boy named tristan grows up to be a rather hapless young man who is smitten with a girl way out of his league and also betrothed to another
nevertheless the young lady goes out once with tristain and he confesses his love to her
after they espy a falling star she tells him he can have her if he retrieves the star and brings it back to her
he agrees and sets out on his quest which will take him to the other side of the wallbr br meanwhile in the kingdom of stormhold the old king is dying
he calls his remaining living sons to tell them who shall succeed him to the throne
his sons' names are primus secondus sextmus and septimus
the other sons where killed by the other brothers in a humorous competition to see who lives to get the thronebr br anyway he tosses his ruby charm to the sky and voila that what brings the star to earthbr br the star crashes in the form of a beautiful woman named yvaine and she of course is wearing the charm
but little does she know she is now being persuaded by tristain the princes and also an aging witch named lamia who wants to cut out the stars heart to regain her own youthbr br complicated
yes
but it all comes together as the adventure unfoldsbr br tristain is the first to find yvaine but is so blinded by his devotion to victoria he does n't recognize the growing bond between he and yvaine
his initial interest lie only in returning yvaine to victoria as proof of his love
but he must get past the princes and lamia first
the princes are n't that big an issue as they are constantly trying to kill each other and just as in pirates of the caribbean never has death been so funny
br br but tristain also encounters the witch who enslaved his mother and a band of flying pirates led by robert denirobr br his is the most important character in the movie and deniro plays it to a tee
he steals the movie with his toughness and soon we learn an undercover secret that will leave audiences on the floor with laughter
though his role is small in length deniro is extraordinarybr br michelle pfeiffer is wonderful as lamia a sexy evil witch
claire danes is most appropriate as the confused and distressed yvaine
she makes a perfect damsel
jason flemyng adam buston rupert everett and mark strong add the perfect dose of levity as the fighting princes whom as they die return as ghosts ala blithe spirit and high spiritsbr br moreover director matthew vaughn whose only other directing experience was layer cake weaves an enchanting tale that everyone will enjoybr br stardust may be too complex for young children but anyone over the age of 13 will want to see this movie multiple times
it 's that good
stardust is what movies are supposed to be
perfectly written perfectly cast perfectly directed and perfectly acted
in other words perfect
this is the epitome of fairytale
the villains are completely wicked and the heroes are refreshingly pure
danes deniroand pfieffer are wonderful as well as the new actor who plays the role of tristan
outstanding performances delightful magic funny and dramatic and a perfect fairytale ending make this film absolutely fabulous
i'm not so sure all content is appropriate for younger children but for an older audience there are plenty of hilarious subtleties
the previews do not do this movie justice
my fianc and i were quite skeptical but were so thrilled we had taken a chance on this movie that i can only hope to assure anyone on the fence about this movie to give it a try
if any style of film could be called my guilty pleasure it 'd be this generic fantasy type
guilty is the wrong word for it though as i'm pretty pleased to be an escapist from time to time
stardust is good stock fantasy the likes of which one should expect from neil gaiman
it is n't the visual dreamscape of mirrormask it is n't the adult pretension of pan 's labyrinth and it is n't the funloving classic the princess bride but it contains just what the fantasylover is familiarized enough with to be completely comfortable during the entire viewing
fantasy lovers should rejoicespecial effects work has finally become good enough and cheap enough that this stuff is in regular production nowbr br the story of stardust involves a young man named tristan who in order to gain the love and approval of the most beautiful girl in their small town of wall goes on an adventure to retrieve a fallen star
to make things difficult however tristan 's fallen star is actually a woman named yvaine and he 's not the only one looking for her some witches have their greedy eyes on the immortality the star 's heart can give and a brother 's feud over the magic kingdom leads murderous princes in her directionbr br from there it 's all pretty predictable but it involves some attractive fantasy elements some warmhearted commentary on the nature of love and the best part robert deniro as a gay pirate
on that note deniro 's performance is spoton it 's not the excessive lisp that most actors use to portray gay people but a surprisingly effective one from someone used to being seen as a roughandgruff typecast character
deniro has n't been so unique to his own image since brazil and that 's saying somethingbr br stardust is the type of movie perhaps that will subsist on children 's and fantasylover 's shelves for a long time
i ca n't say it offers anything new but it 's not really there to
it 's actually those most familiar with it 's tropes that will enjoy it the mostbr br polarisdib
greetings again from the darkness
this one will be compared to the princess bride and although it does n't measure up to that classic it is extremely entertaining and well made in its own right
the story line is a bit odd and the whole wall thing is never really explained but the execution is fine even building up strong suspensebr br charlie cox plays tristan who falls for the wrong girl and agrees to fetch her a fallen star who happens to be played by the stunning claire danes
not much suspense on what happens with these two but the suspenseful part comes in with the wicked witch played by michelle pfeiffer and the prince son of king peter o'toole looking to reclaim the ruby necklace our star is wearing
lots of bad chasing the goodbr br along the way an encounter with the strangest pirate you will see
robert deniro plays captain shakespeare tough on the inside and shall we say in touch with his feminine side
another encounter involves the brilliant ricky gervais as a fast talking trader and that is good for a couple of laughsbr br not your typical chase coming of age or fantasy film but director matthew vaughn 's effort deserves an audience
sadly the poor marketing campaign will probably prevent it from making any money
my guess it will find big success on video
this movie is wonderfulbr br i was 'enchanted' i should say and surprised because of how uniquely it was done
the cast the sequencing the effects everything
magnificent
i mean it was a love story yes but what made it outstanding from the rest was that it was told in an entertaining wholesome mannerbr br for me it is the representation of modern fairy tale
it 's like the modern peter pan simply amazingbr br i surely would buy a copy of this the moment it hit the marketbr br this movie is really a double must see one
10 stars for that
i anticipated this movie to be decent and possibly clich but i was completely wrong
charlie cox played an incredibly good leading man he was so earnest and romantic me and my friend that saw the movie with me totally fell in love with himbr br claire danes who i did like before made me enjoy her even more
her acting was fantastic i could n't even tell that she was american
the chemistry between her and charlie cox was extremely good the casting was quite perfectbr br robert deniro and michelle pfeiffer were equally wellcasted deniro as that gay pirate priceless priceless
i laughed so hard at that one scene where septimus comes on the ship oh my god wow
pfeiffer played a decent villain i liked her as the snippy mother in hairspray
but she had the right amount of melodrama and snide comments throughout the movie
br br overall it was funny romantic the special effects were n't totally frequent but when they were they were great the cameos from ricky gervais and peter o'toole were also wellplaced
br br i totally recommend this movie to anyone who likes fantasy movies like the princess bride or even lord of the rings
it kept my interest the entire time and i will be buying the dvd when it comes out
the beautiful story of stardust is written by by neil gaiman and it 's really a good story
i think it would appeal to any labyrinth princess bride or 10th kingdom fan and yet it 's totally unique and stands up on it 's own
and i feel the film adaptation of this story has a far better ending than what was presented in the original novel by neil gaiman
i wo n't spoil it for youbr br the main character tristan is the son of a mortal and a faerie slave kept by a witch in the realm of faerie
the story begins in a town near a wall that separates the magical world from the human world
when there is a falling star tristan promises to retrieve it for a girl he is infatuated with
he is unaware that the star has taken the form of a girl in the fairy world and that there are others after her too
three elderly witches who want to use her heart to become young again and some bickering princesbr br it 's a really good story
it has humor and magic and beautiful surreal scenes and visuals
it 's charming and i feel it can be watched by children and adults of all ages
it 's simply magical
it 's a true classic fairy tale the likes of which i have n't seen in cinema since the 1980s
as a massive fan of fantasy in general and of the works of neil gaiman in particular i 've been looking forward to this film so avidly so hungrily and with such a bittersweet mixture of anticipation and fear of disappointment that i can scarcely believe it 's finally here
and you know what
i need n't have feared the film version is bldy awesome
different from the book but in a good way less whimsical more comical still deeply sweet and enchantingbr br the special effects are absolutely spoton and make magic feel a natural and proper part of the world of wall without being overtly spectacular and intrusivebr br proper attention has been paid to storytelling and pacing and the casting in the main is a triumph with the ghostly princes stealing most of the best lines and pretty much all of the films' funniest moments which exist in abundance
br br in fact the one minor criticism i have at all of the film is that sometimes the comedy elements become a little ott subtlety goes out of the window to the detraction of the main story ricky gervais' cameo for example was far too much just ricky gervais doing his usual david brent from the office comedy persona for my liking and in my opinion created an unwelcome and jolting break from the magical spell of the progressing story br br but this is a minor quibble in an otherwise immaculately cast and scripted fairytale with a good mixture of action and romance
charlie cox as the protagonist tristan captures the correct mixture of naivety subtle comedy and selfrealisation required for a story like this where a humble young boy embarks on lifechanging quest claire danes as yvaine is beautiful feisty and just ever so slightly alien or ethereal a perfect interpretation of her stellar role robert de niro in the cameo every reviewer is talking about is indeed deserving of praise rollicking good fun and michelle pfeiffer is triumphantly cool and nasty as wicked witch lamia my favourite performance of the film overall
if you enjoyed her deliciously btchy performance in the recent hairspray then you will thoroughly enjoy her in this toobr br so to round off this review you will laugh for sure you will smile and you may even cry stardust is a beautiful heartwarming fairytale for all the family with a heart of gold and more sass 'n smarts than is immediately apparent
one of my alltime favourite films is the absolutely fantastic princess bride and stardust is being readily likened to this with good reason as it is a very similar type of film exploring similar themes and territory and just as the princess bride remains fresh smart and funny twenty years after its initial release i believe that the delicious tongueincheek sweetness of stardust will be showing up as a family favourite on our televisions for many years to come
while i do n't consider myself a big fan of fairy tale movies stardust intrigued me based on seeing michelle pfeiffer in the trailers as a villain
boy is she so convincingly evil here as a witch especially with her ageugly makeup in the beginning and end
robert de niro is also great as the pirate captain who 's forced to hide in the closet to protect his reputation
just about all the actors like claire danes rupert everett ricky gervais peter o'toole and many others do fine work here
while danes and pfeiffer are classic beauties there 's also stunning faces of sienna miller olivia grant and kate magowan especially when we first meet her
newcomer charlie cox is fine as the lead tristan and he looked so much like his father dunstan as a young man that i thought that was him in early scenes with magowan
many comments have compared this to the princess bride and while i can see some resemblances the main difference was that with pb you always knew it was just an imaginary tale as told by an old man to his grandson
stardust makes you believe for the most part that what you 're seeing and hearing could have actually happened even with all the hilarity that happens throughout
so on that note i highly recommended stardust
there are not many movies around that have given me a feeling like stardust did all throughout the course of the film
as magically fairytalelike as the princess bride stardust is most definitely the most wonderful fantasy spectacle of the 2000 's as well as the 1990 's
exciting hilarious and equipped with wonderful imagery as well as unforgettable characters michelle pfeiffer and robert deniro 's especially i challenge anyone to watch this movie without a smile
from the first ten minutes of the film you know perfectly well how it will end but it is the journey and not the destination that enthralls the viewer from start to finishbr br ten stars and not a decimal less
the summer has been so full of blockbusters and comebacks of films and not to mention some of the disappointments of those comebacks that i was woe to find a film i could just sit down and enjoy
br br in case you do n't want to read further down the page i 'll sum it up here it 's more mature than ella enchanted but does n't try to be overly corny or overstep its bounds
think of it as a bit more serious bit more magical princess bride and you 'll be close
br br br br i am perhaps not as prodigious a movie goer as others maybe once or twice a month if i feel active
i'm also a huge scififantasy fan
i get bored of remade repetitive story lines and films with more flash than filling faster than you can count to 10 and this film is the diamond in the roughbr br by the end here i was tired enough of fractured expectations from the big hits that i averted seeing bourne ultimatum in favor of stardust
having had my hopes thoroughly muddied by transformers for my fiction addiction the previews of stardust seemed appealing but i was certainly warybr br as many others here i was utterly surprised
i had gone in thinking to see another generic fantasy movie clichd from here to breakfast
do n't be fooled it is most definitely a fairytale and it does indeed have witches magic and utterly requires suspension of disbelief but the most refreshing thing i found is that it 's not based on anything i 've seen or read in the past 15 years and it 's actually a really good moviebr br br br stardust did n't have me bolted to my seat because of jampacked action at every turn nor was i sweating bullets because of plothook after plothook threatening to tear the dramatic tension apart and echo throughout the theater in a loud boom
it did n't even use enormous blasts of sound to grab my attention to what 's happening on screen
it 's not trying to show off the latest cgi techniques nor did it offend my intelligence with dimwitted dialogs and story lines that are simple enough i could 've figured them out in 3rd grade
br br i just watched
watched and enjoyed a refreshingly creative storyline unfold before my eyes
sure i may have known what was going to happen throughout most of the film but it makes you forget that
it even made my heart twinge at some parts but the most important aspect i noticed is that i left the theater feeling better than when i 'd gone inbr br it truly is a gem
after so much slush this summer with so many remakes and films that fell short of my expectations this was like a cold sweet cup of tea to cap off all the hard work i 'd done sitting through the others trying to come out of them with my money 's worthbr br it 's probably not for everyone but do yourself a favor if you enjoy fantasy films that stand the test of time alone then you should really see this movie
this little diamond is finding its way into my dvd collection the moment it hits stores you can trust me on thisbr br simply wonderful
this afternoon we took the kids to the movies and saw neil gaimans stardust and all i can say is wowbr br it is rare that i am completely taken aback by anything but this is quite possibly the greatest fantasy movie i have ever seen maybe even the best movie of any kind and it is all neil gaiman 's faultbr br sure i could have been sucked in by the wonderful dialog which was smart flowed smoothlyand made the characters completely believablebr br i could go on for days about the spectacular acting charlie cox is perfect as tristan claire daines is brilliant as yvaine and robert di nero almost steals the movie as the deeply in the closet pirate captian shakespearebr br the pure joy brought about by the humor which managed to be laugh our loud funny intelligent enough to make the first shrek look like an 80 's sitcom and blend in perfectly with the rest of the movie alone would have made this a great moviebr br special effects were near perfect true this was no lotr or star wars sf extravaganza but where they were use they were exactly what was called for not too much to distract you from the movie itself and blended into the story perfectlybr br then there is the story
what can i say
how often do you come across a story containing all of the classic fairytale formula components that does n't just come off as another cheap princess bride knockoff
it manages to be familiar and comfortable and yet completely new and refreshing at the same timebr br any one of those things would have made this a good movie all of them combined make it a great movie but they pale in comparison to the rich enchanting world that those elements combine to bring to life well
once again neil gaiman has done it he has driven another dagger into my heart by creating a world of fantasy that is so beautiful and enchanting that i would do almost anything to live in it and only given me a short glimpse into it
i did n't want it to end i wanted to be sucked through a vortex to the land of stormhold and get to meet tristan and yvaine in person to travel it 's fields and valleys stroll through it 's marketplaces and meet it 's residents both dangerous and friendly and stay there forever
it is a feeling that i have noticed whenever i have read anything by gaiman the sandman american gods coraline all left me with a deep sense of sadness when i finished reading them because it was over i could not see anything more into the worlds he had created which seemed to be so much more vibrant and alive than the one i am forced to live in and watching stardust was no differentbr br in the end i'm sure that neil 's writing and this movie wo n't have the same effect on everyone but trust me when i say you will not regret the time or money spent watching this movie it is easily one of the top 5 movies i have ever seen and i can guarantee that anyone at all with a soul will at least like it
the power to dream is a wonderful thing
there 's a saying not all dreamers achieve but all achievers dream
by exploring our imagination we shape our own futures
or build empires
perhaps overcome our fears limitations and obstacles
gain wisdom and benefit mankind
or just find our way to true love and happiness
freud might express such things in symbols
the language of fantasybr br tristan ventures out of a rather twee english village called wall
he goes through a break in the wall
a portal
in search of something that will prove his love to victoria
victoria does n't take him very seriously
so he pledges to bring back a falling starbr br stormhold is the world outside the wall
he discovers the fallen star has taken the form of a beautiful girl yvaine
to complicate matters three evil witches want to get hold of yvaine
if they can eat her heart it will replenish their youth
the 'good guy' they meet on their way is captain shakespeare
he has a fierce swashbuckling pirate exterior but is a sweetie closet queen underneath
heirs of stormhold meanwhile are engaged in a pitched battle over inheriting the kingdom
ricky gervais is an added extras
a buffoon trader throwing in standard gervaistype gags well
tristan 's purity of spirit arouses the love of yvaine so there is a nice little triangle going
till he achieves the maturity to discern pedestal divas from real womenbr br stardust is a fullon large scale fantasy that does credit to its myriad stars
wholly positive and written with a clarity that makes it more worthy of psychoanalysis that a coven full of harry potter romps
production values rival hollywood and the storyline is free of the racial stereotyping misogyny religious or class agendas than shape and pervert so many large scale fantasiesbr br that is not to say that stardust is without its faults
plot and dialogue have many predictable elements and the fairytale quality may be too saccharine for some audiences
but if you want an excuse to let your heart fly this film may well provide itbr br as a boy i remember listening in wonder to albums by the moody blues
they made records with names like in search of the lost chord and wrote lyrics like thinking is the best way to travel
i would fill my head with books on magic and mystery from timothy leary to aleister crowley
shaping dreams
learning to make them real
nowadays people might talk of nlp or positive thinking
adults that remember how to dream with the force of youth but with the vision and application of maturity
do you still enjoy that feelingbr br you are advised not to wait for stardust on dvd
see it on the biggest cinema screen you can find
and dolby digital surround sound if you can get it
the actors look like they had a ball
maybe you will too
except for an awkward scene this refreshing fairy tale fantasy has a fun and delightful undercurrent of adult cynical wit that charms its way into the audience as well as a soundtrack that powerfully moves this fairy epic along
except for one of the robert deniro scenes that does n't come across smooth and appears out of sync with the tone of the rest of the movie this luscious romantic fairy tail has a great storytelling feel and the strong magic and the fine balance between serious adventure scenes and the lighter spiritual humor is well done
in the updated tradition of the princess bride this contemporary presentation of magic and love is captivating
eight out of ten stars
this movie is a lot of fun
the actors really make the movie go the distance though
without giving away the plot i would describe it as a new princess bride cult favorite that should stand the test of time
you get to see a whole different side to robert deniro in this movie
all the elements are there from adventure to romance and well placed comedybr br people of all ages will enjoy it
good special effects may be scary for the little ones
good date movie
great for some escapismbr br deserves an a
the 14 yearold in me is immensely happy that they 're now able to make really good looking fantasy movies and that they 're all the rage what with lord of the rings harry potter and the chronicles of narnia making loads of cash at the box office
this year will see several more most notably the golden compass which has the most exciting trailer i 've seen this year
stardust based on a novel by neil gaiman showed up in theaters this week with little more than a peep
i saw no previews for it only a couple of commercials
the critical reaction is kind of blah
i would n't even have seen it if not for the fact that i have to wait on a friend to see the bourne ultimatum and that nothing else interesting opened this weekend
well if you 'll forgive the horrible pun the stars must have been rightly aligned because i went to see stardust and i loved it
it 's not a huge movie like lord of the rings
the plot line is your very basic fantasy quest filled with obstacles
but within that basic outline the story is lively and imaginative
it 's simply aiming to be a lot of fun and a charming little romance
and it succeeds wonderfully
there were a lot of big films this summer but none of them were nearly as fun as this one
there 's a lot going on but the story is told well and is almost entirely coherent
it is n't a masterpiece but it definitely can occupy the same kind of ground that something like the princess bride has
a lot of fun to be had here if you 're a fan of the genre
i was not expecting much from this movie
i was given a ticket for an advanced screening
i had just gotten off of work
it was hot and i was tired
i had to wait in the movie line for 40 minutes and there seemed not to be any cool air flowing through the hallways of the theater complexbr br once seated in the theater tired and frustrated the movie started i did not recognize any of the actors in the beginning but the flow of the movie was perfect
right from the beginning i became consumed with the movie getting more and more excited with each minute passing
i think this movie is destined to be a fantasyfairytale classic
the actors were fabulous the pace was perfect and the ending was magical
this movie has everything a fantasy movie should have romance clever witticisms great acting and a fair dose of magic
br br i thoroughly enjoyed this movie and was drawn to its original plot and colorful charactersbr br one of the most striking things to me actually was how self contained the story is
unlike so many scifi fantasy movies out there right now which leave openendings and such this was a pure fairytale satisfying in and of itself with no need for a sequelbr br original
fun
feelgood fantasy
ok here is how i do this
i grade movies on 10 components
each component will inherently start with 5 points
it can then lose or gain 5 points for a possible 10 or 0br br mood action romance comedy drama suspense i give this component 10 points
it had a perfect balance of all five aspects
the action was fun and exiting
the romance was not overdone but still very emotional and moving
i laughed hard and long throughout the movie and still i was captivated by the fantastic drama and riveting suspensebr br plot i give this component 10 points
i thought all the good fairy tales had already been told
i found my self sitting in the theatre returned to my childhood and in that instant i again believed in unicorns wicked witches and falling stars that make dreams come truebr br cinema photography i give this component 8 points
while the movie captured the story very well in the majority of the angles i found my self more than once trying to figure out what happened just off camerabr br fx i give this component 10 points
i love that they used cgi
sparingly
the epic scenes were believable
the magical powers were frighteningly realistic
all in all less is more and this had it all
cast i give this component 10 points
no names and seasoned actors alike the cast was amazing
michelle pfeiffer was wonderfully wicked charlie cox made tristan come to life claire danes gave emotion to the stars and i will never look and robert de niro the same againbr br acting i give this component 10 points
even the newbie actors played their rolls to perfection
once again i will never look and robert de niro the same againbr br character development i give this component 9 points
this felt a little rushed and i think if the movie had been a bit longer they could have done the characters a little better justicebr br dialogue i give this component 10 points
the dialogue was smart witty fun even the mush had good dialoguebr br score i give this component 7 points
i can honestly remember only one small piece of music from the entire movie
i am not complaining beyond the fact that the music could be more memorablebr br ending i give this component 9 points
almost perfect ending
i feel that certain aspects of the ending should have been more pronounced while others could have been more subdued but no threads were left untiedbr br total 93 buy the dvd
hel yes
see it in the theatre
most definitely
bottom line excellent movie for everyone
epic
i strongly recommend seeing it in the theatre i know i 'll be going back for seconds
stardust another guarded review br br the marketing machine has only just begun for this one so i doubt most of you have heard about it
in truth i had n't either
when i got the posting i thought it was another code name and was actually worried it was transformers one of the movies i want to see when not working so i an enjoy it 100 as a mere mortal moviegoer
turns out it was n't transformers and i had been aware of it way back when as 'that neil gaiman movie'
what is it about
well in short it 's a gaiman fairy tale about a boy and a fallen star
any more than that and i 'd be giving away plot info which is a breach of contract and spoiling your fun
if you really want to know what it 's about go buy the book
rumour has it gaiman might be something of a writerbr br not knowing what to expect in a movie can be so pleasant if the surprise is worthwhile
and for this one it certainly was
this screening was 'special' in that it included not just film critics but also exhibitors and local scififantasy folks
so you know the expected audience right
i mean with this crowd and the title of stardust i knew what to expectbr br oh how sweetly wrong i wasbr br yes it is a fairy tale written by an author famed in comic bookdom
but it was not lord of rings
it was not even another lord of the rings wannabe
it was much more intimate than all thatbr br but like lord of the rings it was the well humanism of the film which sells the fantastical qualities
it 's surely a romantic tale but with generous splashes of humour
and that humour is of the sort which is not slapstick shrekism
it 's more along the lines of dramedy than comedy
before i go on let 's do this movie review thingbr br acting is in the very least good
it 's always hard to say more than that for fantasy films but i do believe there were significant superbly acted roles
michelle pfieffer is not sadly one of those
she plays a villain and she does the job
nothing special
rupert everett though he was a real jerk
that is a great villain
peter o'toole is well peter frickin' o'toole which is marvelous
ricky gervais is perfectly cast and shows why
robert de niro seemed to be having too much fun for the most part
when he wanted to deliver the goods though he did
and charlie cox as the lead character was fine surprise from a guy i ai n't never heard ofbr br claire danes
claire danes
claire danes
i 've always been of mixed opinion with her
she can be great and then she can seem to miss the mark
in this she 's the former
and she is quite literally the star of this film
sure her accent stumbles here and there
and yes she 's not as good as she can be when cox is n't in the scene
however well see for yourselfbr br special effects are muted yet accomplished and only significant where they should be
best flying ship yet sorry potter
direction is lighthearted and flows nicely
cinematography could have been better but not everyone films in new zealand
all else is top bracketbr br and now that that 's done br br the writing
oh the writing
neil you devil
it 's hard in today 's climate to do anything original and at first you begin to wonder
a kingdom a dying king a boy out to prove his own worth witches ghosts a quest what 's new
but gaiman 's story draws you in with its surface familiarity only to subvert it all into a sweetly original tale of a boy and his heart
and though you suspect how it 's all going to turn out you begin to wonder in the third act and if you 're me find yourself pulled into the rousing climactic confrontation and hoping for the best
in the end you 'll find this story this movie is what all fairy tales should be but all too often are not
fantastical and realbr br br br those i spoke to afterward had the same impression i did
a great film for all ages to enjoy and the new for this generation
the blank gets filledin only after the movie is in wide release because well you might be expecting it
you 'll know when you walk out anyway
i sincerely hope stardust does n't get lost among the tentpoles
even if it does it 'll be my pleasure to push into the hands of everyone i knowbr br br br forgot to add the reveal
i'm a few years late but a great film for all ages to enjoy and the new the princess bride for this generation
br br perhaps a bit lofty an assessment but i'm still confident that years form now there will be the same oh i love that movie response to this as there is now for the princess bride
i was one of about 200 people that was lucky enough to see an early sneak of this filmbr br stardust follows tristan a young man on a quest to find a fallen star and bring it back to the woman he loves in order to prove his love for her
the only catch is that the star has fallen on the other side of the wall a doorway between england and a magical kingdom known as stormholdbr br this film was just a joy to watch it has something in it for everyone all of the action scenes are played out beautifully and the comedy is spread out through the film making it funny without being corny
if i had to compare the likes to another film it would probably have to be the princess bride a classicbr br all the performances are outstanding the beautiful claire danes makes you love her in her portrayal of yvaine the trusting naive star and under rated michelle pfeiffer delivers a stellar over the top performance as larnia but the performance to talk about is robert de niro in every scene that he is in hands down he steals the show br br if you are in the mood for a funny fantasy love story this is the film
guys do n't get turned off by the description there is enough action comedy and not to mention lots of eye candy with claire danes and michelle pfeiffer to keep you entertained throughout
the cinematography is dead on and keeps with the feel of the film nothing about the film seems forced
i went to a small advance screening of this movie on july 19th knowing no more than the names of a few of the actors and that it was a fantasyadventure quest of some sortbr br the plot line really is nothing like i have seen and a unique story is certainly appreciated with everything else that is currently in or coming soon to theaters
in spite of what first impressions may give it is n't cheesy corny tacky or ridiculous and is actually highly entertaining and funny
the flow is quite well done nothing seems rushed or dragged out
the soundtrack for lack of better words is magical and adds much to the film as opposed to simply filling the silence as often happens in movies or tv
and even though i might have known what was coming at points i still could n't bear to stop watching the screen to my knowledge not a single person left the theater during the entire moviebr br my one gripe is that there seems to be almost no marketing for this film and as brilliant as it is i ca n't figure out why
why are the previews so blah for a movie that is so awesome
everyone should know what an excellent movie this is
it is engaging and funny from moment one original and wellacted
i wish the movie was doing itself as good press as it deservesbr br for anyone that loved the princess bride labyrinth and other truly funny and original fantasy adventure this is one of the great ones
robert deniro is hysterical
relative newcomer charlie cox is an incredible leading man
claire danes is fantastic as always
michelle pfiefer is making quite a splash with her recent returns to the screen
there are also a lot of wonderful moments from minor characters even down to facial expressions
okay this show is nothing but awesome
it has a great story line and plot and great actors and actresses
jeremy sumpter is so hott and he is perfect for the role
he is gunna be big in hollywood
he has a bright future ahead
this show better last a long time because i really love this show and i hope that it has a lot of success
it is so interesting
i have been waiting for it to come out for about 6 or 7 months and it 's finally here and it 's great
i tape it too
i can watch it whenever i want now
too bad its only on once a week though
i wish it was on at least twice a week because now i wish that it was tuesday every day
hope you all like this showbr br ashley
to anyone who might think this show is n't for them please give it a try
network television has degenerated into shows that are clones of clones or are reality based shows featuring some often unreal people
this show is a return to family oriented tv where the emphasis is on learning some life lessons learning what real friends and family are about and maybe even learning a little bit about our national pastime
jeremy sumpter is one of the most appealing young actors in show business today and he is perfectly cast as the young slightly naive new batboy for the fictional new york empires
dean cain christopher lloyd mare winningham and kirsten storms round out the main cast and they are all exceptional
this show deserves a chance to catch on and be seen
hopefully it will stick around for a few seasons and we can watch pete young learn and grow
this is a good family show with a great cast of actors
it 's a nice break from the reality show blitz of late
there is nothing else quite like it on television right now either unless you count joan of arcadia as being similar because it has a teen lead character too
anyway clubhouse is worth a look because jeremy sumpter gives the main character a kind of likability and naivet that is appealing without being overly sweet and cuddly
dean cain christopher lloyd mare winningham and kirsten storms round out the rest of the main cast members and each is terrific in their role
i really like kirsten storms as pete 's sister betsy she is quite a pill but she still cares about her mom and brother even though she hates to show it
it may take a few episodes to really find it 's legs but clubhouse is easily one of the best shows to come along in a good long while so check it out peopleyou 'll be glad you did
me and my sister saw the premiere last night it was so good we were glued for the whole thing hahaha i think i'm hooked for the season
they have some really good actors in this thing the head coach guy and the player that likes pete were very good and the plot has already got me but i do n't really understand how they 'll keep it stretched for a whole season there will probably be some big twist tho i cant wait till tuesday finally jeremy sumpter who is he
i can tell hes going to be big
he was soo good we fell in love with his character right away cant wait for the next episode go jeremybr br 'aimee
this show has a few clichs and a few over the top dawson 's creeklike moments but overall it seems like a decent show
most of the characters seem very real and the story seemed to move along well in the pilot ending with a good lesson in the end
i just hope every episode does n't turn out to be lifealtering like the first that would just be too much drama for this vehicle
jeremy sumpter does an excellent job as a teenager with a passion for baseball i believe a lot of us could relate to his awe and sometimes tunnel vision for the team that he always wanted to a part of
i was dragged to this movie about four years ago by a french actress friend of minebr br for the first half hour i was sitting in my uncomfortable seat at the new beverly theater in hollywood hating this film hating myself and even hating the french actress
and then br br i do n't know what happened but i was pulled into the film in a way that i had n't been in years
and this was despite the fact that one of the projectors broke and they had to do each changeover by hand
i was in the theater for close to four hours but it was worth it
br br i believe that great movies pull you inside a world make you a part of it and then drop you off to talk about with your friends over coffee or a drink
this film did that
it was one of the best filmgoing experiences i have ever hadbr br br br
since my third or fourth viewing some time ago i 've abstained from la maman et la putain while i wait for the dvd
in the meantime i 've read the french screenplay as well as alain philippon 's monograph on jean eustache
the latter ends with a frustrating filmography eleven films fiction doc and inbetween impossible to see or in the cases of mes petites amoureuses and le pre nol reseebr br a few questions that hit me this moment polish vronika 's french is plenty colloquial
even so does she have an accent
i think i can tell she does
what does the absence of color add especially at the single spot the fringe of the city is glimpsed
how does this fringe differ from the sleep and journey that separates worlds of the tempest and the winter 's tale
ditto alphaville
we may imagine the elapsed years since have done it but does eustache deliberately circumscribe the film 's milieu
is this an enchanted isle
is alexandre 's a fairy tale
alexandre 's always choreographing himself worrying about how or where to stand or walk what to say when announcing these decisions to who have to care less than he does what he does
or is this his way of trying to choreograph others by doing it to himself
how different is he from vertigo 's scottie
what 's the difference and is there one between eustache 's laud and truffaut 's and godard 's
how different is the present laud
is n't he still doing it whatever it is in recent roles irma vep le pornographe whatever approaching old age
once i arrived early for one in a series of mostly antoine doinel truffaut films
for a long while every three or five minutes down the aisle would come a twentysomething male in scarf tweedy coat laud hair with a directionseeking nose
i have no idea whether this was conscious or unconscious mimicry
i was that age but have no idea what i myself looked like then
no scarf at least
i do have a brother though who seems to have learned his carriage from bresson
a have a female friend who is currently being drawn into a relationship with an sob who has a long term girlfriend
of course the sob is very goodlooking charming etc and my friend is a very intelligent woman
watching jean pierre leaud 's character at work is exactly like watching what goes on in real life when guys like that destroy the lives of our female friends
it 's tragic and you know she 's going to end up very hurt but there 's nothing you can do
leaud is brilliant
totally empty
a blank throughout he pulls the faces and tells the stories he thinks will get the reaction he wantsbr br the scene two hours in when leaud and lebrun have made love and the next morning he puts on a record and very sweetly and charmingly sings along to amuse her is brilliant
the what the hell am i doing here with this idiot expression that flickers back and forth across her face will be in my memory for a long time to comebr br it 's a long film but see it in one go preferably in a cinema
takes a while to get into but then the time just disappears
i hate overlong overtalky french movies but my favorite movie of all time is the longest and talkiest french movie of them all
i saw it twice in the mid70 's and then it disappeared
but i finally got to see it again in 1999 and fell in love all over again
what is most remarkable is that it feels every bit as fresh today as it did 25 years ago
if you have n't seen it do n't miss your chance
a have a female friend who is currently being drawn into a relationship with an sob who has a long term girlfriend
of course the sob is very goodlooking charming etc and my friend is a very intelligent woman
watching jean pierre leaud 's character at work is exactly like watching what goes on in real life when guys like that destroy the lives of our female friends

the what the hell am i doing here with this idiot expression that flickers back and forth across her face will be in my memory for a long time to comebr br it 's a long film but see it in one go preferably in a cinema
takes a while to get into but then the time just disappears
well of course not women are overly sensitive and needy on average which is interestingly portrayed from mother to whore though not pseudoartistically extravagantly or blatantly dwelt on
unlike many of you i have only seen la maman et la putain twice
as many good films i noticed my opinion of it improved after a second viewing
all that i know is what i have seen and have yet to delve into further exploits until i myself have acquired the dvd
i have yet to figure out precisely why i enjoy this movie so much but really what do i care why
though i'm sure i could and will form some wonderful explanation
all right so you may disagree perhaps it is a bit boring at times i'm not an expert
the blonde reminds me of a lovely grushenka
i decided to watch this because of the recommendations from this site
i would have to say it was worth the effort
however you should take heed that this film will go on for 210 minutes
if you do n't have the staying power get it on tape and watch it over a couple of nightsbr br now to the film what i say will contain spoilers and if you do n't mind here goes br br alexandre is a promiscuous bum a womanizer and a gigolo
he lives with an older woman called marie
marie owns a retail shop and she provides for alex
alex spends his days at cafs and restaurants
the story reveals that alex had previously impregnated gilberte whom he used to live with
gilberte dumped him for a less attractive man that she did not love because alex had abused and battered her
at this point alex was willing to get a job and and help raise their child before he found out gilberte had aborted it and planned to marry someone else
br br by chance alexandre meets a nurse nymph called veronika and they striked up a relationship
veronika fell in love with alex for the first time after all the sordid sex she had with men in the past
marie and veronika struggles for alex 's affection and had a mnage trois to boot
finally at the end it 's revealed veronika is pregnant with alex 's child and alex asked her to marry him
we assume alexandre will even get a job and be the provider for his new found love and family
there is hope
br br with the title of la maman et la putain i deduce jean eustache was relating to franoise lebrun 's character of veronika
she was a whore and then she became the mother
hence the mother and whore is the same person
anyway what do i know
french films are mostly very chatty aimlessly political preaching theatrical insipid lamenting and full of quotes
lebrun and laud played their obdurate characters well and held the film together as some part of the script became a little lost and disjointed
br br not a bad effort
710
we do n't have to lose this movie this is one of the greatest i have ever seen
jean pierre leaud is amazing and the movie is one of the most unforgettable of the nouvelle vogue
jean eustache is no more on this earth we just have this black and white images to remember one of the greatest and most subvalued french directors
you just have to love this masterpiece
i 'll never forget itbr br ps
sorry for the english
a great movie rather challenging than really entertaining
sadly no memorable quotes here but this one 's my favorite alexandre if you 're leaving someone that you have loved you have to say what i'm telling you now farewell i'm going
but to disappear to hide like a criminal is ignoble
br br in my opinion this expresses it all
there is so much tactics involved in the relationships between alexandre and the others and yet everyone longs for a little bit more truth
however knowing the truth can hurt even more as alexandre experiences
common interpretation is that the movie criticises the mere possibility of liberated love by depicting the unwanted implications on the people involved
it does indeed show this in a convincing manner but i would appreciate it if the reasons had been treated a bit more in depth it 's not that liberated love is in itself doomed to failure but people should work on themselves and try to overcome the ruling morals before and not through practicing liberated lovebr br that said the movie 's realistic though and really worthwhile watching
possible spoilers br br i like this film and have no problem staying awake for it
it reminds me of me at 20 except this is even better
like veronica says two chicks at one time
it brings out the horniness in me the casual conversation these two real life chicks rather than hookers teasing us every step of the way
i get into the conversations too
even if they are utterly bs
at times so what
every chick just about that i 've ever talked to and is high on herself is usually full of the same unreasoned rambling gratuitous selfcentered bs
philosophy
it 's just a bunch of nonsense and about as sensible as that other bs
philosophy chicks are often into astrological charts
the only deal with this movie is the guy is almost as feminine as the women he 's into the same bs
and moodiness
the brunette chick is actually the most masculine person therebr br i think it 's kind of funny that the brunette chick gets so obviously turned on by veronica
she 'd love to pull the little blonde away from alexander but veronica plays her all the way
she 's brilliant
she gets the brunette thinking there 's something up between them and then she steals the boychildman which is only appropriate since they appear to be from the same age group
the brunette knows she 's been had by the end when she 's dropping her face into the palms of her hands while marlene deitrich sings in the background that paraphrasing there are a million couples in paris tonight but i only have this refrainbr br but do they get married in the end alex and veronica
mmmm
i can only imagine a supertumultuous relationship ending in a premarriage breakup
they are too selfish to be anything to each other than stepping stonesbr br i like the film though
it kept me entertained it 's got a nice look and it 's sexy
this movie is so complex that it can be given any description and still roll with it
you have a insecure troubled and fascinating main character who is trapped between two women
we listen to his social philosophical and moral idiosyncrasies in interminable monologues we see him working his magic around the three women that he loves
this could be the premise for a fowl movie full of rigid cold uninteresting commentaries
yet director jean eustache manages to keep it fresh ironic and witty
being such a long movie one cannot but burst into laughing when after 2 hours of speaking politely jeanpierre laud all of a sudden screams on the phone while he remembers a cheesy line from a movie
this kind of situations are purely cinematographic and cannot be fully restored in a commentary
nor can someone restore the tragic and painfully beautiful monologue of franoise lebrun towards the end of the movie
3 and 12 hours and worthing every minute
la maman et la putain is the beautifulest film of all time
and what 's most moving about it may be the relation between reality and art the movie deals with which is directly inspired by proust 's a la recherche du temps perdubr br indeed la maman et la putain and in search of lost time apparently tell the same story the one of the failure of love which repeats itself endlessly
the first woman 's name is always gilberte and the second woman appears like a twisted and deformed double of gilberte veronika is like a whore gilberte beautiful like the night whereas gilberte was pure and beautiful like the day
after the failure of the first love a second love begins but this one is like already doomed by the first one
veronika takes the place of gilberte in alexandre 's life and in the movie
she progressively eclipses her first by time to time gilberte 's still coming when alexandre waits for veronikathen totally
that shows it 's the same sad story repeating itself the same unfaithful woman like alexandre says who appears endlessly and unfaithful is for proust the higher point in love which makes it exist but which also underlines its illusionsbr br art is what causes the passage between what 's outside the illusion of love to what 's inside which is the truth and is a learning of this truth
for instance when veronika notices the strange way alexandre makes is bed he answers that he saw it in a movie and then that a movie it 's made for that to learn how to live how to make a bed
alexander wants to live like he was in a film he wants his life to be art
br br this conception of art comes from proust with whom eustache shares the same rejection of political art and realism in art
la maman et la putain fights against a conception of art principaly political see for example the ironical review of a political movie by alexandre
like proust says art does n't care for all this proclamations and only exists in silence
first of all art is introspection
and that also why realism or naturalism is rejected art needs to transform reality to exist
proust writes i discover the illusion of realism which is a lie
that 's why la maman et la putain does n't hide its artificiality underlines by the way the actors say their text the more you seem artificial the higher you go said eustachebr br eustache and proust both share this idea that the artist is a translater of a inner truth
but alexandre failed where eustache succeed
la maman et la putain tells us the failure of a character to be what he truly is
you can sens the tragedy arise when you go further in the movie which becomes saddest
you can see it in the face of alexandre who looks more and more like a livingdead
you can see it by the fact that the scenes become longer and that after a while nothing happens outside
at the end of the movie when you see alexandre writing and veronika asking if he 's writing his lifeyou can guess that he 's not that even literature failed
the end of the movie shows the symbolic death of alexander who is smashes by the heaviness of reality
and in this tiny nurse 's room alexandre looks more like albertine than marcelbr br to explain this failure we can say that alexandre is a balzac 's reader
in forme et signification jean rousset explains that in proust 's the readers of balzac who are swann and charlus are unable of any artistic creation because they 're stuck in reality which they mistake with art
they see reality in art and are not aware of the transformations that necessarily exist between the life of an artist and his work between reality and art
and that 's exactly alexandre
he claims for instance that he loves a woman for parallel reasons because she played in a bresson 's for example
he 's like swann who falls in love with odette because she looks like a botticelli 's womanbr br life is perhaps not my vocation
this thought is indeed by eustache who committed suicide even if it 's said by alexandre
nevertheless there is a difference between alexandre and eustache if eustache is absolutely alexandre alexandre is like a double without art a horrible vision of the artist which crystallizes his fearsbr br by fallowing veronika at the end of the movie alexandre is condemned to illusions
it 's death that remind me the last frames of the movie in the face of jeanpierre laud as well as in the endless pucking of veronika
or maybe it is already hell that describes the end like in sarte 's huitclot and absolutely not like in the final liberation of le temps retrouv
if eustache had read proust alexandre could never have finish the book always perturbed by life and veronika when he tries to read it at his apartment or in the cafs
la maman et la putain is like a inverse double of in search of lost times which tells how alexander does n't become an artist whereas a la recherche du temps perdu tells how marcel becomes a writer br br if like baudelaire says an artiste tells reality at the light of his dream it is his nightmare that eustache tells us in la maman et la putain
in what could have been seen as a coup towards the sexual revolution jean eustache wrote and directed the mother and the whore as a poetic damning critique of those who ca n't seem to get enough love
if there is a message to this film and i 'd hope that the message would come only after the fact of what else this benhur length feature has to offer it 's that in order to love honestly there has to be some level of happiness of real truth
is it possible to have two lovers
some can try but what is the outcome if no one can really have what they really want or feel they can even express to say what they want
br br what is the truth in the relationships that alexandre has with the women around him
he 's a twentysomething pseudointellectual not with any seeming job and he lives off of a woman marie slightly older than him and is usually if not always his lover his last possible loveofhislife left him and then right away he picks up a woman he sees on the street veronika who perhaps reminds him of her
soon what unfolds is the most subtly torrid love triangle ever put on film where the psychological strings are pulled with the cruelest words and the slightest of gestures
at first we think it might be all about what will happen to alexandre but we 're mistaken
the women are so essential to this question of love and sex that they have to be around talking on and on for something to sink inbr br we 're told that part of the sexual revolution in theory if not entirely in practice was that freedom led to a lack of inhibitions
but eustache 's point if not entirely message is that it 's practically impossible to have it both ways you ca n't have people love you and expect to get the satisfaction of ultimate companionship that arrives with fing as the characters refer over and over again
br br the mother and the whore 's strengths as far as having the theme is expressing this dread beneath the promiscuity the lack of monogamy while also stimulating the intellect in the talkiest talk you 've ever seen in a movie
at the same time we see a character like alexandre who probably loves to hear himself talk whether it 's about some movie he saw or something bad from his past eustache makes it so that the film itself is n't pretentious though it could appear to be but that it 's about pretentiousness what lies beneath those who are covering up for their internal flaws what they need to use when they 're ultimately alone in the morning
br br if you thought films like before sunrisesunset were talky relationship flicks you have n't met this
but as eustache revels in the dialogs these characters have sometimes trivial or 'deep' or sexual or frank or occasionally extremely emotional it 's never ever uninteresting or boring
on the contrary for those who ca n't get enough of a good talky film it 's exceptional
while his style does n't call out to the audaciousness that came with his forerunners in the nouvelle vague a dozen years beforehand eustache 's newwave touch is with the characters and then reverberating on thembr br this is realism with a spike of attitude with things at time scathing and sarcastic crude and without shame in expression
all three of the actors are so glued to their characters that we ca n't ever perceive them as 'faking' an emotion or going at all into melodrama
it 's almost too good in naturalisticrealism terms but for eustache 's material there is no other way around it
luckily leaud delivers the crowning chip of his career of the period and both ladies particularly labrun as the whore veronika
and as another touch every so often the director will dip into a quiet moment of thought of a character sitting by themselves listening to a record and in contemplation or quiet agony
this is probably the biggest influence on jim jarmusch who dedicated his film broken flowers to eustache and has one scene in particular that is lifted completely in approach from the late parisianbr br sad to say before i saw broken flowers i never heard of eustache or this film and procuring it has become quite a challenge
not a minute of that time was wasted the mother and the whore is truly beautiful work one of the best of french relationship dramas maybe even just one of the most staggeringly lucid i 've seen from the country in general
it 's complex it 's sweet it 's cold it 's absorbing and it 's very long perhaps too long
it 's also satisfying on the kind of level that i 'd compare to scenes from a marriage true revelations about the human condition continue to arise 35 years after each film 's release
unfortunately jean eustache belongs like so many once leading french film makers nowadays to the great unknown ones whose movies are hard to find and are not released on international dvds
since we have a good oldfashioned videostore in tucson i had the chance to watch this 3 12hour marathon masterwork that is not boring for ten secondsbr br since we speak here about one of the most discussed movies of all times let me tell you my impression that the endless dialogs originally typical for the early nouvelle vague of a jacques rivette or alain resnais appear almost ridiculous in this movie
the dialogs are basically monologues mainly the longest ones spoken by jeanpierre laud
the most characteristic feature is that the intersections of the speeches of two people is almost zero
laud or his character alexandre pleases to tell more about himself than about the topics he is seemingly to speak
therefore one can hardly speak about communication in this movie
it is well possible that the director had a gargantuan satire in mind against the idle running of the once so hotly discussed political and sociological ideas but the type of man alexandre exists to all times we find him already in petron 's satiricon which work has actually great resemblance with the mother and the whorebr br alexandre does not only nothing but he has developed an own kind of metaphysics about the absence of acting at least acting in the sense of responsibility toward the society whose part he is
he mocks at the people who run to work at 7 c'clock in the morning when he is just busy having his last drink before he goes to bed in the apartment of one of his girlfriends from whose money he lives
he is unable to speak one sentence without quoting one of the leading thinkers between nietzsche and bernanos
especially sartre who is shown quickly in the french intellectual caf aux deux magots where alexandre too is sitting all day must serve as excuse for the lifestyle of alexandre and his colleagues because they suffer existential crisis from bourgeois nausea
however the intellectual speeches of alexandre seem to be rather pseudointellectual and the sentences and quips he cites seem to come rather from a dictionary of quotations than from his actual reading of the respective booksbr br it is true this movie demands an extremely broad european knowledge especially the connoisseurship of french existentialist philosophy and there consequences to the 68 student revolution movement but if you have this knowledge than you will enjoy 215 minutes of your life by staring amazed into the tv and crying out with laughing like you have probably not done it since a long time
of all the reviews i 've read most people have been exceedingly hard on alexandre
neither marie or veronika ever seemed that they would particularly desperate to keep alexandre he being only slightly intelligent though not at all intellectual as most of us are however hard it may be for anyone to admit
alexandre is getting away with life perfectly being totally taken care of getting and giving what he wants
the girls are allowing this veronika loves sex marie is his patron
is there anything wrong with any of this
is anyone in love
really
i do n't think so
though french new wave cinema is prone to pretension and so on it is marvelous simply because of its lack of a need for a plot in order to create emotion
ease is perfectly lovely and all anyone in alexandre 's position in an urban area can ask for
i'm looking for a patron anyone interested
la maman et la putain has to be watched as a movie that is both related to the time it was released and eternal in many respects
true the actors do n't act true they talk a lot but what they talk about is just what makes life worth living or dying
the very long monologue spoken by franoise lebrun is perhaps the most accurate and moving text that was ever written about womanhood manhood and love
not easy to translate accurately though
this movie is a statement about the difficulty of being a man and a woman
and imho jean pierre laud is one of the greatest french actors
it is not an easy film to watch it is over three and a half hours long and it is composed entirely of conversations
yet it is so incredibly compelling and ruthlessly observational of the human character that it is in my humble opinion one of the very greatest films of all timebr br the film is depressing cynical and cruel
it shows the idealism of the late 1960s to be nothing different from the society that it was trying to changebr br it involves a supposedly liberated mnagetrois between alexandre marie and veronika
yet alexandre is shown to be as chauvinistic and jealous as any other man
the women are exposed as being willingly subservient and defining their femininity through the male gazebr br the film is an extremely icy end to the highly revolutionary french new wave
this movement was one of the most significant movements in film history and had a profound effect on cinema as we know it
jeanpierre leaud was one of the key actors of the new wave having starred in the influential les quatres cent coups by francois truffaut as a rebellious teenager
director jean eustache is not as well known as other directors from the new wave but he should bebr br there is no improvisation and the dialogue comes from reallife conversations
the film is resonant with eustache 's personal experiences
for example francoise lebrun was a former lover of eustache
eustache himself committed suicide in 1981 and the reallife person that the character marie was based on did too
the anger and bitterness all culminate in a harrowing monologue by veronika delivered directly to the audience breaking down the coldly objective nature of the rest of the film
this mesmerising personal and honest filmic statement remains one of the most revealing films of human nature around
one of the last classics of the french new wave
for direction cineaste jean eustache drew from the simplicity of earlycentury cinema for story eustache drew on the torments of his own complicated love life
so many things can be said of this film observationally brilliant self indulgently overlong occasionally hilarious emotionally draining etc
etc
in my mind whatever complaints that can be leveled against this film are easily overshadowed by its numerous strengths
every film student writer or simply anyone willing to handle a 3 hour film with no abrupt cuts no music video overstyling no soap operalike plot twists and no banal dialogue should make it a point to see this movie
everything is to be admired the writing acting and simple direction make this film unforgettable
this is undoubtedly a film that stays with you
910 30 minutes of pure holiday terror
okay so it 's not that scary
but it sure is funbr br the crypt keeper tales a tale of holiday fear giving us all christmas goose gossebumps that is
bwahahahahha
you should really be careful what you axe santa for
have a scary christmas and a happy new fear
okay i 'll stopbr br okay so in the story a greedy wife kills her husband for the money
but her plan is ruined when a crazy killer dressed in a santa suit comes her waybr br if you look it up on youtube you can watch it for free but most of you have already seen this
but if you have n't seen it i suggest you do
ho ho homicidal maniac
this spirited tourdeforce adaptation of a great ec comics horror tale is undoubtedly one of the best episodes of the cable tv series ever made
director robert zemeckis makes the most out of a witty script by fred dekker which centers on a ruthless twotiming housewife who kills her jilted jerk of a husband on christmas eve by whacking him upside the head with a firepoker
complications ensue when a deranged murderous madman dressed up as jolly kris kringle escapes from a nearby asylum and decides to pay trainor a decidedly unfriendly visit
alan silvestri 's spooky stirring score and dean cundey 's typically polished cinematography further enhance the macabre fun
and larry drake with his creepy hiccuping guffaw a demented twinkle in his bright green eyes and a leering truly wicked grin makes for a sensational sanguinary saint nick
an axellent second installment that manages to be just as good as the first
br br once again the casting is just wonderful
i like how the first and second episode have nothing in common except for the wit and clevernessbr br the second episode is just very funny very silly and very enjoyable
it is the very first christmas episode about a woman who is tormented by a serial killer dressed as santa after having killed her own husband
just like the first episode karmabr br the most humorous scene is a tie between the murder of her husband and her phone call first faking her fear until it becomes real
i have watched this episode more often than any other tftc episode it is that enjoyable
and it is quite scary but all in good ghoulish fun
a woman kills her 2nd husband but runs into a problem when an escaped maniac in a ragged santa claus outfit decides to pay her and her little girl a visit at that very moment
mary traynor who i seem to remember from snl or some other tv comedy skit show is the evil wife and larry drake plays the lunatic in the dingy santa outfit
i had forgotten santa was played by drake over the years
his santa is an unstoppable force and quite frightening at times
you can probably guess how santa finally gets into the house
the episode is played for laughs but it also can be pretty intense at times
tales from the crypt and all through the house starts on christmas eve as elizabeth kills her husband joseph she drags his body outside ready to throw it down a well but while doing so misses an important news bulletin on the radio that says a homicidal maniac dressed as santa clause has escaped from a local mental asylum has already killed several women with elizabeth next on his list but she has other ideas tries to turn the seemingly dangerous situation to her advantage br br this tales from the crypt story was episode 2 from season 1 directed by the one of the show 's regular executive producers robert zemeckis and all through the house is a decent enough watch
the script by fred dekker was actually based on a story appearing in the comic 'the vault of horror' was originally adapted to film as one episode from the britsih horror anthology film tales from the crypt which starred joan collins as the murderous wife character here played by ellen trainor
this particular version is good enough but does n't do anything different or special is a bit too linear predictable to be considered a classic
at only 25 minutes in length it certainly moves along at a good pace the story is just about macabre enough it generally provides decent entertainment i quite liked the downbeat ending
this time there are christmas themed opening closing crypt keeper segments complete with the usual punsbr br director zemeckis does a good job there 's a nice winterly atmosphere with a hint of christmas influence as well
there 's not much gore here someone has a poker stuck in their head someone 's face is cut with an icicle someone 's arm is cut with an axe there 's some blood splatter but generally speaking it 's not that graphic
the acting by a small cast is pretty goodbr br and all through the house is n't the best tale from the crypt but it 's a decent one all the same worth a watch but after the comic book story original 1972 film version did we really need or even want this
and all through the house is a special crypt episode not only because it 's from the first season but this episode was the first one i saw
i remember as a young man being on vacation with my parents that summer in 1989 in our hotel room in south carolina on hbo i saw this episode and i was buried to the crypt right then and forever
i had always been a fan of horrorsuspense series and liked monster movies and with this series started by hbo i again had fearful pleasure
this episode being the first one i saw is memorable for me and one of my favorites it 's just so enjoyable with a nice twist
and all through the house has a nice cozy setting on a snowy christmas eve which is a perfect way to get you relaxed for holiday chopping
well anyway you have mary ellen trainor as a greedy philandering wife who takes care of her hubby while waiting on some money and a new romance
only like most horror series things take a turn for the worst and bad people get what they deserve
the odds are greatly stacked when a maniac dressed as santa escapes from a local nut house making for a late holiday chopping on christmas eve
as from the old ec
comic lessons you learn bad people get what they axe for
well this tale ends with a perfect holiday scream
also this tale was in the 1972 movie and featured joan collins this is without a doubt one of my favorites and probably one of the classic crypt episodes of alltime
episode two of season one is a delightful holiday tale of love betrayal and a homicidal escaped lunatic dressed as father christmasbr br a woman has just murdered her hubby on christmas eve for his life insurance
what begins as a perfect crime begins a struggle to survive as a deranged santa clause suit wearing psychopath threatens her life as well as her precious young daughtersbr br this episode is warmly remembered by even those casually acquainted with the program
by the waythis particular reviewer watches it every christmas on routine
most notable for it 's escalating suspense and narrative twists and all through the houst is among tales from the crypt 's best
although i 've long been a fan of peter weir i had n't watched any of his australian movies until i watched the last wave
and it was a pleasant unpredictable surprisebr br richard chamberlain plays david a lawyer invited to defend five aborigines charged with murdering another aborigine
for david 's peers it 's a clear case of drunken disorder and they think they should plead guilty and serve a quick sentence
but david believes there 's a mystery underneath the murder linked to tribal rituals
as his investigation proceeds he learns not only things about his clients but about himself toobr br to reveal more would be to spoil one of the strangest movies i 've ever seen
i can only say that this movie goes in directions that no one will be expectingbr br there are many elements that make this a fascinating movie chamberlain 's acting for instance but also the performances by david gulpilil who plays a young aborigine who introduces david into tribal mysteries and nandjiwarra amagula who plays an old aborigine who 's a spiritual guide
the relationships between these three characters make the heart of the moviebr br but there 's also the way weir suggests the supernatural in the movie
david has dreams that warn him of the future
australia is undergoing awful weather with storms hail falling and even a mysterious black rain that may be nothing more than pollution
but it 's also related to the case david is defending
how it 's related is one of the great revelations of the movie
out of little events weir manages to create an atmosphere of dread and oppression suggesting future horrors without really showing anythingbr br charles wain 's score is fantastic especially the use of the didgeridoo
the photography is also quite good
russell boyd weir 's longtime dp who won an oscar in 2004 for master and commander depicts a dark creepy world full of mysterybr br i also find it remarkable that for a movie centered on aborigines it does n't turn into an indictment against white culture or into a sappy celebration of the their traditions like dances with wolves or the last samurai
this movie is too clever to be that simplisticbr br sometimes it can be frustrating and it may upset viewers who expect to finish a movie with everything making sense but for those who do n't mind some strangeness or ambiguity the last wave is a great movie to watch
i just watched the last wave in my school 's fine arts library
it 's intriguing like all peter weir 's stuff but it 's not always as attentionholding as i would have liked
i found myself fascinated by the ideas being thrown at me but at the same time i was not stimulated enough by them
aka i got a little bored in spotsbr br the plot surrounds an aussie lawyer who becomes obsessed with certain dreams he has which link him to an aborigone group he is defendingbr br it starts out with an intense weather sequence and has some very awesome mood effects throughout and strong direction but it just did n't entertain me like weir 's later films do
i might just need to watch it again thoughbr br good film about obsession and mystery
because in the end the mystery that exists between the whites and the aboriginies offers some very severe consequencesbr br god bless peter weir though
for him alone this film is worth watching very organic director
like an aussie response malick
i 'd give it a 7 because it 's got enough great ideas to overcome its boring moments
you know the people in the movie are in for it when kingsized hailstones fall from a clear blue sky
in fact the weather stays pretty bad throughout this atmospheric thriller and only lawyer chamberlain has the answer
but he 's too much the european rationalist i gather to get in touch with that inner being that only reveals itself through dreamsbr br darkly original mystery heavy on the metaphysics from directorwriter peter weir
already he had proved his skill at flirting with other dimensions in picnic at hanging rock
here it 's the arcane world of the australian aborigines that confronts that the tightly ordered world of the predominant whites
something strange is going on inside the aborigine community when they kill one of their number for no apparent reason
yuppie lawyer chamberlain is supposed to defend them in a white man 's court
but the more he looks into things the more mysterious things get and the more interested a strange old aboriginal man gets in him
and then there 're those scary dreams that come and go at odd timesbr br well structured screenplay deepens interest throughout
one reason the movie works is the background normalcy of chamberlain 's wife and little daughters
audiences can readily identify with them
and when their little world runs into forces beyond the usual framework the normalcy begins to buckle and we get the feeling of worlds beginning to collide
chamberlain underplays throughout especially during the underground discovery tour where i think he should have shown more growing awareness than he does
after all it 's the picking up of the mask that holds the key to the riddle yet his reaction does n't really register the revelation
br br of course the notion of nature striking back has a certain resonance now thirty years later
in the film the notion is wrapped in a lot of entertaining hocuspocus but the subject itself remains a telling one
one way of bringing out a central irony in the movie is the symbolism of the opening scene
a big white suv barrels past an aboriginal family leaving them in the historical dust
the terrain looks like an interior tribal reservation of no particular importance to the coastal fleshpots where industry dwells
yet it 's also a region most likely to survive anything like a destructive last wave
perhaps there 's something about past and future to think about herebr br anyway this is a really good movie that will probably stay with you
the last wave is never going to win over the mainstream audience
it is a slowmoving but fascinating film for those who are willing to go along with it
an australian properties lawyer is asked to take on the case of five aborigines accused in the murder of one of their own
all sorts of portents and omens soon pop up as the man 's death involves a tribal issue that was not meant for white man 's court and pretty soon the lawyer is having trouble distinguishing reality from fantasy
it looks like the end of the world may be at hand and he and the aborigines may know this but no one else does
richard chamberlain as the lawyer is at his peak here
david guptil a familiar face from several other australian flicks and a decent actor is one of the five aborigines on trial
the last wave is simply not for everyone anymore than is magnolia
check it out on a slow saturday night
i remember seeing this when it was released in a theater in palo alto and not expecting much
i mean an australian movie
but it finally got to me
here 's a scene
richard chamberlain is sitting cross legged on the floor of a shabby apartment in sidney facing an australian aborigine elder named charliebr br chamberlain you were outside my house last night
you frightened my wife
who are you
and charlie at a deliberate pace replies who are you
who are you
who are you
who are you
who are you
are you a fish
are you a snake
are you a man
who are you
who are you
who are you
it 's a stunning scene shot all in close ups with chamberlain 's blandly handsome face filling the screen in opposition to charlie 's black broadnosed bearded visagebr br the two guys could n't be more different and this film is the story of how chamberlain accidentally stumbles from his humdrum lawyerly existence into the inexplicable almost unspeakable mysteries of charlie 's worldbr br i do n't think i 'll go on much about the plot
it 's kind of an apocalyptic tale
but i must say whoever did the research on australian aboriginal belief systems should get an a plus
they 've got everything in here from pointing the bone to the dream time a kind of parallel universe in which dreams are real
it 's an extremely spooky movie without any musical stings or splendiferous special effects
charly 's world simply begins to intrude into chamberlain 's dreams for reasons never made entirely clearbr br if there 's a problem with the script that 's it
nothing is ever made entirely clear
does chamberlain who seems to have some extraordinary rapport with the aborigines die in the last wave
do the aborigines
does the entirety of sidney
the basic premise is a little hard to accept too though granted that this is a fantasy
the aborigines are invested with the kind of spiritual power that americans bestow on american indians whereas the fact is that mythology is mythology and while one may be more complex or satisfying more elegant and beautiful if you like mythology is still an attempt to transcend an ordinary demanding and sometimes disappointing physical existence
the mysticism of charlie is more convincing that the miracles of moses in cecil b demille 's the ten commandments but they 're brothers under the skinbr br but i do n't care about that
taken as a film this one is pretty good and it 's especially important for marking the celebrity of the director peter weir and the australian film industry
this was the first of a great wave of films from the antipodes some of them raucous like mad max and some subtle and dramatic like lantana
i like weir 's stuff which resembles nicholas roeg 's in being pregnant with subliminal dread
try picnic at hanging rock for an example of how to make a truly chilling movie with not a drop of blood
this motion picture has a steady haunting pace backed up with great acting and a story that is revealed to us over timebr br beyond that the music fully establishes the mood and assists in maintaining an uneasy cautious and somber tonebr br weir 's story is enhanced by using aboriginals their stories and their tensions with the dominant white population to deliver a fantasy tale that is ominousbr br although they are unrelated in story as well as genre this maintained the same feeling within me as ursula le guin 's lathe of heaven
br br the last wave is a dramatic thriller with some shocking moments
remember hacking and slicing does n't make a film a horror movie it 's the psychological element of fear and trepidation that rests within us all
across the great divide which we call understanding there is still much we do not know about that which was explained by the early tribal elders
in every instance there is much concerning the dangers of knowing too much
conversely there are those who warn us of not preparing for what they warn is the 'end time'
in this movie called the last wave an aboriginal native is murdered for no apparent reason
when those responsible are arrested they remain silent less they disturb the order of things
david burton plays the defense attorney assigned to defend the accused
although haunted by prophetic images from his own childhood and warned by modern signs given to him by an sympathetic aboriginal named chris lee burton proceeds to defend the infraction as tribal law and therefore not subject to standard justice
the movie is fraught with puzzling dark foreboding images of apocalyptic end world disasters and warns of a future island tsunami and doom
black drama and deep rituals are what gives this film it 's frightening allure and therefore is not for the fainthearted in fact the simplest haunting apparitions can last for years in the nightmares of innocent movie goers
good silent drama
while to most people watching the movie this will be of little interest but out of the many hundreds of movies dealing with magic and the occult in one form or another this one is probably the best in many waysbr br from the golem to the craft the subject seems to be of endless interest to the movie industry
the majority of movies which touch on it in any way do so childishly either taking the transcendental elements as cheap excuses for cheesy special effects or cardboard cutout villians
more frequently the subject comes up in an hysterical religious context
rarely a movie seems to show at least some passing experience with magic as it is practiced in real life but the presentation of the occult in such movies can at best be described as allegorical and not literal or symbolic or just not quite rightbr br i watched this movie again after many years tonight
i had seen it before on vhs it is a dark moody piece and after watching it on dvd i would say if you have any intention to watch this movie watch it on dvd do n't watch it on vhsbr br the darkness and moodiness are overpowering in vhs but in dvd the movie takes on a very different tone
i think weir pushed the dark aspects intentionally for style but when the movie is converted to the lower color medium of vhs this goes over the edge
dvd brings the movie to life again and i saw it differentlybr br anyway seeing it as if for the first time i realized that the treatment of magic is extremely good in this movie
it 's difficult to go into all the reasons why i do n't care to take the time to do sobr br for anybody who 's curious anyway if you want to see what it is like in real life this movie is just very right on countless levelsbr br and for anybody who is n't you really wasted a lot of time reading to this point
david burtonis a lawyer more adept at handling corporate taxation who is called on to take a case concerning a group of aboriginals charged with the murder of one of their own named billy we see that he tries to steal stones with ritual painting on them and is killed when a leader of an aboriginal tribe named charlieuses a death bone to stop his heart
meanwhile revolving around david bizarre weather patterns effect sydney such as rain beating down polluted dirt and rocksized hail during bright blue skies not to mention a deformed rainbow which is splitinto groups
as david pursues the case he finds that he is far closer to the weird events taking place than he could ever realize
one aboriginal named chrisappears to him in a dream holding a stone with blood and he finds that this man is one of those he is to represent at trial
he finds that it 's quite possible after some strange meetings with charlie and conversations with chris that he very well might be linked to a spirit named mulkurul and that his dreams are actual premonitions of possible horrors yet to comebr br absorbing apocalyptic drama builds it 's story methodically and is completely original and unpredictable
with peter weir in charge the film is visually arresting as we see these very overwhelming images of possible doom towards civilization but the film 's most compelling angle is certainly david 's journey to find that monumental truth that plagues him as he questions charlie and chris countlessly at first to help his men get off from a crime they did n't commit and ultimately to find out what he has to do with anything catastrophic that is occurring or might occur later
'the last wave' is far more than the sum of its parts
it 's not merely a disaster film not simply an exploration into australian aboriginal spirituality and certainly more than a simple court drama
writerdirector peter weir manages to take these elements to the next level to produce a truly effective and thoughtprovoking film with the same eerie atmosphere he gave to 'picnic at hanging rock' two years earlier that you will continue to remember years laterbr br when lawyer david burton is called to defend chris lee over the death of an aboriginal for which he may or may not be directly responsible he finds himself not merely struggling to get the truth from lee but making sense of what he hears when it does come
as with the aboriginal belief that there are two worlds the everyday and the dreamtime the truth exists on two completely different levels with ramifications more disastrous than burton could ever have imaginedbr br no doubt the reason why 'picnic at hanging rock' is better remembered is because of its enduring mystery
we are led along the same path but forced to find answers for ourselves
in 'the last wave' we can piece everything together by the end of the film
however even with all the information we have to choose how much of it we want to believe because the film takes us beyond the borders of our normal realitiesbr br on the production side weir uses his budget to great effect progressively building a sense of doom in everything from soft lighting to heavy rain to good use of sound
the incidental music is unobtrusive never trying to be grandiose
richard chamberlain manages to convey the bafflement the audience would doubtless feel as he tries to unravel the mystery
david gulpilil excellently portrays a man trapped between two worlds wanting to do the right thing but afraid because he already knows the endingbr br put all these things together and you have a perfect example of why david weir is a familiar name in cinema thirty years on
strongly recommended
spoiler alert all throughout australia the summer turned into a deluge of rain and hail stones the size of baseballs that was causing havoc in coastal cities like sydney
it 's under these hectic conditions that tax lawyer david burton richard chamberlaingot involved in a case as a defense attorney involving the death of a local aborigine who was found dead outside a sydney bar
br br having five fellow aborigines arrested for billy cormansathol compton death it 's determined by the police coroner that billy died of drowning not by violence even though he had bruises on his neck and shoulders
yet the court decided to prosecute the five for his death charging them with manslaughter instead of murderbr br david defending the five gets no help from them in their defense with the accused assailants opting to remain quite and keep what happened to billy to themselves and take what 's coming to them from the court
one of the defendants chris david gulpili begin to somehow invades david 's dreams as if he want 's to tell him what was really behind billy 's deathbr br david at first not taking his dreams of chris seriously begins to sense that their real when he meet him at the courthouse
chris confirms david 's dreams by showing him a strange looking black rock that david saw chris have in his dreams
later meeting chris and what turns out to be an aborigine shaman charlie who came to his house that evening david is told that he like charlie has spiritual powers that he inherited from his mother 's grandfather
those powers will reveal to him the future that has to do with the strange weather conditions that are flooding the australian continent
the earthchris tells david is going through a gigantic cleansing cycle with the old world about to be washed away and the new world ready to take it 's placebr br david is confused about what both chris and charlie are telling him but as the rains continue to increase and the ocean waves start to rise he feels that something terrible is going to happen
david want 's to know if it 's all aborigine folklore or there 's some scientific facts or logic behind their end of worldlike revelationsbr br by now it 's obvious that both chris and charlie are members of an aborigine tribe right in the heart of modern sydney
that alone can get chris off as well as his four friends for the murder of billy
since the australian government will not prosecute tribal aborigines leaving any justice to be done by the tribes themselves
still chris refuses to admit he 's a member of a native tribe and he and his four friends are convicted of manslaughter in billy 's death with the sentences to be handed down by the judge within daysbr br david now determined to find out what was the reason for chris' silence and why billy had to die is taken by chris to the scene of the crime
it 's there that david finds out that billy betrayed chris' tribe members by going there with billy not being a member of chris 's aborigine tribe
it 's also revealed to david that he himself has some kind of spiritual connection with the austrailan aborigines as both charlie and his stepfather rev
burtondavid parslow told him
br br the stage is now set for the great and final cleansing cycle that david 's been seeing in both his nighttime dreams and daytime visions
it comes in the form of a massive tidal wave rolling out of the pacific ocean into the australian coast city of sydney and then submerges the entire continent
peter weir 's first international success the last wave is a mainly effective chiller with a fascinating back story based on aboriginal myth
richard chamberlain gives a good performance as a defense lawyer whose life becomes increasingly unmoored from reality as he delves deeper into a murder case involving aboriginal tribal rivalries
david gulpilil plays one of the suspects who does his best to guide chamberlin thru the realm of 'dreamtime' an alternate realitytimeline central to native australian history and tribal custom
heavy on atmosphere deliberately ambiguous in plotting the film builds to an unsettling finale which is somewhat diminished by poor effects probably due to budgetary limitations
nevertheless an intriguing film whose overall impression of mystery and dread lurking just below the surface of what we perceive as 'reality' will stay with you
this supernatural peter weir thriller is truly one of the most haunting and fascinating movies ever seen
richard chamberlain does his best performance here as the australian lawyer who defends a group of young aborigins accused of murder
as he gets closer on the case he discovers more about the main defendant chris and not least about himself
chris tells him that he is a mulkurul which appear to be a race of supernatural beings that lived in australia thousands of years ago
at the same time extraordinary high rainfall seems to confirm the aboriginal prophecy of the coming of the last wave the one that will drown the worldbr br the dream sequences and the supernatural effects enhance this movie and make it a spectacular experience
olivia hamnett and david gulpilil are solid in the supporting roles as well as the chap with the difficult name who plays charlie the old aborigin who can turn into an owl
the climax and the ending do n't disappoint in contrast to many other supernatural thrillers who fall flat after a promising hour or so
however this can not be called a pure thriller
it is a drama as well and talks about spirituality and spiritual identity in the modern world
a masterful work by peter weir the master of visually stunning dramas
the last wave is one of those movies that relies heavily on the mind
the title refers to the aboriginal doomsday theory there will be one last wave that wipes out everythingbr br david burton is a sydney lawyer hired to defend some aborigines accused of murder
around this time there has been unusually heavy rainfall in australia
while defending the aborigines david learns the last wave theory and begins to wonder whether it 's just mythologybr br the movie 's last sequence is a metaphor for descending into the depths of one 's mind
peter weir created a perplexing but thoughtprovoking movie
aboriginal actor david gulpilil provides an interesting supporting role as one of the defendantsbr br if you get a chance watch the making of feature on the dvd
peter weir explains some of the film 's undertones some of which relate to richard chamberlain 's background
richard chamberlain is david burton a tax lawyer living in sydney australia who is drawn into a murder trial defending five aboriginal men accused of murdering a fellow native in peter weir 's apocalyptic 1977 thriller the last wave
taking up where picnic at hanging rock left off the film goes deeper into exploring the unknown and in the process shows the gulf between two cultures who live side by side but lack understanding of each others culture and traditions
weir shows how white society considers the native beliefs to be primitive superstitions and believes that since they are living in the cities and have been domesticated their tribal laws and culture no longer apply
br br from the start burton is drawn deeper and deeper into a strange web of visions and symbols where the line between real time and dream time evaporates
water plays an important symbolic role in the film from the opening sequence in which a sudden thunder and hailstorm interrupts a peaceful school recess to burton 's discovery that his bathtub is overflowing and water is pouring down his steps
as violent and unusual weather continue with episodes of black rain and mud falling from the sky the contrast between the facile scientific explanations of the phenomenon and the intuitive understanding of the natives is made clear
burton and his wife annie study books about the aborigines and learn about the role of dreams in the tribal traditions
when he invites one of his clients chris lee to his home for dinner he is disturbed to find that he is the subject of an inquiry by chris and his friend charlie an enigmatic aborigine sorcerer involved with the defendants
as burton 's investigation continues his clients make his work difficult by refusing to disclose the true events surrounding the murderbr br after chris starts to appear in his dreams burton is convinced that the aborigine was killed in a tribal ritual because he saw too much though chris refuses to acknowledge this in court
burton becoming more and more troubled by a mystery he cannot unravel says to his stepfather priest why did n't you tell me there were mysteries
this is a legitimate question but according to the reverend the church answers all mysteries
burton knows now that he must discover the truth for himself and enters the tribal underground caves
though we do not know for certain what is real and what is a dream he comes face to face with his deepest fears in a haunting climax that will leave you pondering its meaning into the wee hours of the morningbr br in this period of history in which native hopi and mayan prophecies predict the end of history and the purification of man leading to the fifth world the last wave though 25 years old is still timely
the aborigines are portrayed as a vibrant culture not one completely subjugated by the white man yet i am troubled by the gnawing feeling that we are looking in but not quite seeing
weir has opened our eyes to the mystery that lies beyond our consensual view of reality but he perpetuates the doomorientation that sees possibility only in terms of fear showing nature as a dark and uncontrollable power without a hint of the spiritual beauty that lives on both sides of time
this is one of my alltime favorite films and while it may move too slowly for some it 's well worth seeing
a corporate lawyer is dragged into a case involving city aborigines and this is no ordinary case
ok a man has died but it was n't exactly a normal killing
there has also been a greater than average amount of rain lately and the atmosphere of most of the film is somewhat claustrophobic oppressive
the aborigines are harboring a secret and refuse to spill the beans
this has a lot to do with white men making assumptions about city vs tribal aborigines and of course no abo in the big city would practice tribal ways
uh huh
chamberlain is having strange dreams and he is somehow the key to what 's happening although no matter how many times i 've seen this i ca n't quite grasp the exact connection
this is a very eerie and creepy film and is a fine example of peter weir 's ability to create tension out of nothing
the ending is a little ambiguous but i take it literally it 's the easiest way out and the scariest
10 out of 10 and highly recommended
i like ghost stories
good ghost stories of bumps in the night voices that cannot be explained
now i 've see many of them
as special efx have a ever more grip on todays films some times to find a real gem you gotta turn the clock back to the time when the writers and directors really had to use their heads to create really good ghost stories
now this one very rare pilot episode for the tv series ghost story called the new house was one of the most scariest films i ever saw
it was on once in 1972 i was only 9 but nothing since then even compared to it
with all the remake going on in hollywood some one should do this one as is with no more special efx than the original
this episode was down right creepy as hell
i'm lucky to find it finally on dvd today and very rare and hard to find
the only other 2 ghost stories to even come close was the original the haunting and george c scott in the changling
wish someone would do more ghost stories like these
i grew up watching this series
i was about seveneight years old when it was on
i still remember the 1st episode which was called the new house
it scared the hll out of me
i can almost still hear that statue laughing madly
and the ending oh my god
the hooror spirit comes in the room for the child yikes
this was classic tv and it was a one of a kind series
i have found a dvd collection for sale on the internet 2 actually
my question to any readers has anyone purchased this set
its a bootleg
both sellers claim to have very good copy
i have a sketchy and poor dvd of the new house episode and a couple of other episodes that are a bit betterhowever if anyone knows if these are much clearer it would be worth it to me to buy and share with my kids
a great series clever scary and daringly supernatural
thanks in advance to any fans who have the low down on any of this in fact i 'd love to discuss it
chris walker
ghost story is a terrific horror story
this is from the circle of fear and the ghost story series of the early seventiesthe beginning and ending of each story is narrated by sebastian cabot
remember him from the early family series family affair in the 1960s
this particular story has barbara parkins and david birney as the lead actors and as the main characters in the storyi saw this recentlyand i was so scaredif you are alonei would not recommend that you watch thisthis story is terrificno gore or curse words but very scary
barbara parkins played the young bride
david birney played her husbandboth actors were very good in their partsif you like scary funterrifying ghost stories then you will like this little gem
i gave this a high ratingi highly recommend this story
ghost story was the pilot for the nbc series
the movie was wellwritten and wellacted and i thought when the 197273 tv season started if the tv series is half as good as the movie then nbc has a winner
the series was a colossal disappointmenteven with william castle as exec
producer
if howeveryou have a chance to see the original tv movie ghost story check it out
you wo n't be disappointed
this is a very entertaining flick considering the budget and its length
the storyline is hardly ever touched on in the movie world so it also brought a sense of novelty
the acting was great and the cinematography was also very well done
i recommend this movie for anyone who 's into thrillers it will not disappoint you
i had the pleasure of seeing this film at the rhode island international film festival and was very impressed
tess nanavati is clearly a great screenwriter and i would love to see more of her films
if she could do what she did with the budget of this film i'm very anxious to see what she can do with a major picture
kudos to the cast for their terrific performances and to whoever composed the music
the warped row your boat blew me away
very creative film all around i really hope to see it come out on video or dvd because i 'd buy it in a second
if you get the chance you should definitely see this film
maybe i identify with this film cause i live in nyc and suffer from bad insomnia but whatever it is i must praise the filmmaker on a most amazing job
to do what she did with no budget wow thats all i can say
really really good
like no money was spent on this film and it still blew me away
i definitley suggest checking it out if you can
great directing fantastic score and of course a script that will knock you on your arse
see it
i had no idea what this film was about or even knew that it existed until about 1 month ago when i stumbled upon when i was searching for other films that stared dominic monaghan
i thought this film was a strange insight into the mind of a none sleeper and what hisher mind may be going through in the hours that they spend awake when the rest of the world around them is asleepit was an interesting film and a good part was played by dom i believe that even though this film you cannot buy anywhere you must see it if you ever get the chance because it will really make you think about those people around us that cannot sleep and have to suffer night after night of not been able to sleep or only get about 1 hour of sleep every night so overall it was an interesting film of good substance
i 'll come clean
the only reason i even found out about this dvd was because dominic monaghan is a favorite actor of mine
when i heard the title of the film i thought it was going to be different perhaps in not such a good waybr br but i was wrong
after reading what few reviews were out there about this short i was actually excited about seeing it
i sent off for my copy as soon as able and received it a few weeks later
needless to say i was not disappointedbr br the film follows jack a insomniac who is often plagued by conditions which causes him to doubt what is reality and what is all in his head
i wo n't give away what happens but i will tell you that the film can sometimes be frightening in it 's realismbr br the directing is fantastic focusing on what is essential to the story without allowing it to lose any entertainment or thoughtprovoking momentsbr br all in all i give this great film 9 out of 10 for going far beyond what i thought any short could achieve
i first saw this movie at a festival
there were many good movies but few kept me thinking about it long after and an insomniac 's nightmare was definitely one of them
tess is definitely a gifted filmmaker
the shots were great
casting was perfect
dominic shined in his role that she perfectly crafted
there was n't a lot to know about his character but she wrote the story in such a way that we cared about him
and ellen i ca n't wait to see where she ends up
she 's showing a lot of talent and i hope she does a few more films
with all the million dollar budgets trying to get a cheap thrill tess shows that it 's all not needing as long as there is a good story and actors
kudos to everyone involved with this film
and thanks to tess and co for distributing it on dvd
this is an almost actionless film following jack an insomniac as he goes through hallucinations is visited by dead friends throws himself off a building and for a lot of the time ca n't tell reality from hallucinationbr br dominic monaghan as jack is truly believable
confused and scared but lethargic and at times blankly accepting of what he sees we follow him trying to sort out what he 's seeing and find a way to sleepbr br introduce a talking dog and children that suddenly appear in jack 's bathroom and bedroom without any explanation as to how they got there and you have an interesting mind boggling 43 minutes and the shower scene is enough to get any dom fan coming back for more
an insomniac 's nightmare is the story of a man 's plunge into insanity
having chronic insomnia jack is plagued by hallucinations causing him to try and determine what is real and what is n'tbr br we find out interesting things about jack near the end and think that by the time the movie is over we will have a happily ever after hollywood ending
wrong
this is new york city the place where nobody sleepsbr br tess nanavati has herself a good film in 'an insomniac 's nightmare'
a talented filmmaker and writer she has real potential and will be one to watch in the upcoming futurebr br as i watched this short film i was constantly uncomfortable between the music bleak scenery and realistic portrayal of an insomniac by dominic monaghan i desperately wanted to turn this off at times just to escape from it
this movie draws you in and gets you hooked on keeping your eyes on the screen
the writerdirector is brilliant with the narrative parts and the use of creative and interesting camera angles and perspectives which all add to the gripping hold it will have on you
insomniac 's nightmare is original and refreshingly different from any other movie you have seen
is it a dream or reality
this indie will have you discussing the twists and turns it takes through the conscious and subconscious
it has an eery feel with it 's dark interpretations of illusions
dominic monaghan really became the insomniac
he is a great actor who is not hard on the eyes either
he really poured his whole being into this role
from the storyline to the way it is shot makes this indie one of my favorites
i recommend it highly and eagerly await to see more from this innovative creative writerdirectorcinematographer
surprisingly well done for an independent film an insomniac 's nightmare paints a startling picture of what it would be like to suffer from insomnia
wonderfully well written and directed it creates the atmosphere of a dream as the viewer is taken through one night in the life of an insomniacbr br starring dominic monaghan as jack we get to see everything he sees as the long hours of a lonely night drag on
the narration is almost hypnotizing and from the opening lines it is impossible to turn away
fascinating and slightly disturbing it shows how someone copes with a lack of sleep balancing on the brink between sanity and madnessbr br with twists and turns around every corner an insomniac 's nightmare is provocative and engaging
it comes very highly recommended
this is one of the first independent movies i 've ever seen
for such a very low budget it was done well as an insomniac myself i can sympathize with the main character although my sleeping problems have never been as intense or as disturbing
br br well directed well acted of a subject that i have n't seen much in theaters lighting and set both perfect for the movie setting
there are few noticeable goofs but they may be intended you 'll see after you watch the movie
the movie is very personal and worth watching twice
no movie is flawless but a hollywood version could n't do the story better
all in all 810
i have seen this movie a while back after ordering it for my friend who is a big dominic monaghan fan
the movie itself was very interesting though it had its positive points which for me was the donnie darko kind of wtf
factor after the movie had endedbr br of course with positive also come negative points
to me the young girl in the film was incredibly good and dominic monaghan did a good job as well
unfortunately i do n't have this opinion about daniel burke who played lonnie
this might just be me and i'm not claiming to be a serious critic in the way that i do n't find myself skilled enough but he just did n't seem convincing as an actor
but perhaps it 's even more striking then for although i am not a critic this does get my attentionbr br to conclude over all i think it 's definitely a film worth watching
it 's interesting confusing and you just should have seen it
i saw insomniac 's nightmare not to long ago for the first time and i have to say i really found it to be quite good
if you are a fan of dominic monaghan you will love it
the hole movie takes place inside his mind or does it
the acting from everyone else is a little rushed and shaky and some of the scenes could be cut down but it works out in the end
the extras on the dvd are just as great as the film if not greater for those dom fans
it has tons of candid moments from the set outtakes and a great interview with the director
anyone who has gone through making an independent film will love to watch tess dom and everyone else on the very small close personal set try to bang out this little trippy creepy film
it was pretty enjoyable and i'm glad to have it in my collection
an insomniac 's nightmare was an incredibly interesting wellmade film
i loved the way it just throws you into the main character 's subconscious without coddling the viewer the acting was top notch honestly i would watch dominic monaghan read the phone book
but everyone else especially the young girl was great as well
i was very impressed by the look of the film too
usually independent films have a grainy ishotthisonmycamcorder look to them but this director knows what she 's doing
the lighting the cinematography quality work
i'm looking forward to a featurelength work from tess nanavati
i did n't know what to except so i think it was a lot better not having excepted much
do n't get my wrong its not a bad short film
tess nanavati is a relatively new directer and writer so i think she deserves a lot of kudos for making this film
you can tell that it has been an act of love for her
the acting is a little cheesy and the quality of film is not great either but for a really low budget film its good
there was times when the story line gets convoluted and there are parts that drag on though i do n't feel it greatly detracts for one 's ability to understand the film
if you love dominic monaghan as much as i do i say go for it
the gag reel was fun i wo n't spoil it but there is a particular scene that makes buying the dvd worth it just so you can watch it over and over
if you like the film then check out the pink mirror a film also done by jagged edge
i know fans of dominic will enjoy this little piece of heaven
this film is one of the best shorts i 've ever seen and as i make it a point to be at all the major film festivals i 've seen a lot especially of what the industry considers the best
i'm not a fan of monaghan
his acting generally tends to be overdone and uninteresting to me his only decent performance being in lost so i generally try to avoid his films
i did however happen to see this at a film festival a few years back and was completely awed
this director really knows what she 's doing
of course you are going to get the trolls who do n't understand what constitutes a good film and rip on low budget work because they have no idea what went into it
but luckily from what i 've seen they are in the minority when it comes to this gembr br let 's not deny that the film was working on no budget and that a couple of the supporting actors could still use work because that 's certainly true
the production value is very low but what can you expect for a first real film from someone still in high school
pretend for a moment that the budget does n't matter
if you take away a bit of the acting the sound quality and the fact it was shot on minidv then what are you left with
the story the visual composition and the soul of the film which are indisputably flawlessbr br nanavati can tell a story
that much is clear
she can write substanceheavy engaging scripts better than most people in hollywood create a shot list that perfectly compliments that story and bring it to life in a fascinating creative way that were this higher budget might have won awards
give it more experienced actors better sound postproduction and 35mm instead of minidv and even the trolls could n't complain
this girl is incredible and keeping in mind that insomniac was made a good few years ago she 's done some amazing work since
the trailer for dreams of an angel shows that and i ca n't wait to see the higher budget stuff she 's done
910 stars this is one hell of a movie from one hell of a filmmaker
i rated this a ten just because i find it so impressive what a single eighteen year old can do with a video camera
it 's no epic but it 's plenty engaging and i was never bored
if tens of millions of dollars can go into the countless bad films that are poured out en masse then give this director the same amount of money and see what happens
i know i 'll be lining up at the local cinema for her first major release
damn good job and well worth the money
what a script
it might be low budget but it beats the hell out of half the major pictures i 've seen lately
nanavati knows how to tell a story both in writing and on screen
serious kudos to her ca n't wait to see more
this film as low budget as it may be is one of the best psychological thrillers i 've ever seen
if you accept that it 's low budget from the start you can appreciate just how good of a story it is how very well written the script is and how great the filmmaker was to produce something so wonderful with so little moneybr br all the elements of a great film are here
the visuals though shot on digital were gorgeous in places
the bizarre dreamy feel of the film is captured particularly well in the scene with the talking dog that scene was just amazing
it 's such a trippy piece of work but not done in a pretentious way and because of that i have a whole lot of respect for this film
it comes highly recommended to anyone looking for something unique and captivating and different from much of the repetitive films that are out there
i came across an insomniac 's nightmare while looking for offbeat independent films and glad to say it did not disappoint
this crazy half hour ride had me wondering all the way through and the ending was excellent one of those nooooo moments that really stays with you
i 've shown it to a number of people and everyone seems to agree hands down
the little ghostie girl was very talented and i think her performance stole the show
she creeped the heck out of me i can say that much
nanavati did a great job putting this short together
all the pieces just fell into place and you can tell that she 's a great writer from what she did with this script
so well written
it 's undoubtedly the strongest part of the film
the directing was great and the acting was enjoyable but the most important factor here is the strength of the screenplay
good job to this girl i ca n't wait to see more
i must say that i had wanted to see this film for a long time and i was not disappointed
the acting of dominic monaghan is simply fantastic
as a part insomniac myself i can relate with how the story develops
i have never experienced anything of the sort but some awake moments overlap the sleeping and it can be scary
it was a great film worth every penny
i hope that one day i can work with tess myself it would be an honor and beyond
i can recommend it for everybody
maybe not small children as they may get scared
but if you are an insomniac like me you 'll understand the world the mysteries and the fear
you 'll love it
br br f
have to be honest and say that i have n't seen many independent films but i thought this one was very well done
the direction and cinematography were engaging without becoming a distraction
the angles settings and lighting used successfully created the nightmarish world in which the main character was trapped
many haunting and memorable images from the film stick in your mind long after it 's over
an ok movie about downs syndrome
a mother has twins one is very sick the other is good but he has downs
the mother does not think she can raise him so she gives him to some people who have 15 kids 11 have downs
the mom does not like this she thinks he should be with his family so they take it to court the family gets broken up the grandparents lose it never really says if the mom daughter makeup
i think this movie 's good but the plot is familiar it 's still good has a few unintentional laughs
hello everyone this is my first time posting and i just love the movie no child of mine and i could watch it over and over
well i taped it a long time ago like a few years ago and i dropped it and broke it and i have n't seen it in a few years
could any one please tell me when it will come on again
i would really appreciate it alot
you can email me if you want to cause that is my favorite movie of all including empty cradle to and if anyone knows when that comes on to please let me knowi would really appreciate it alot
br br
while i do n't agree with bob 's and tammy 's decision to give up baby jesse and it 's something i 'd never do they were trying to do what was best for the baby
the way this movie is written you see yourself becoming wrapped up in the story and asking yourself what you really believe from all different aspects
patty duke
antagonist
almost unheard of as far as i'm concerned
but during the movie she really convinces you that she 's psychotic or at least that there 's something seriously wrong with her
her character is the meaning of emotionally disturbed
the movie seems to end quickly leaving things somewhat unresolved
but other than that this movie is really great
it really makes you think
it 's not a movie to watch when you just want to kick back and relax and watch something cute that 'll make you laugh
but it is a good movie to see when you want to challenge your own beliefs see things from others' perspectives and discover a little something about yourself
caution you may even grow while watching this movie
and it 's all worth it in the end
rock 'n' roll high school will probably have to go down in history as the ultimate rebellious party flick
portraying a bunch of high school students using the ramones' music as inspiration to rise up against their despotic principal the whole movie is a mile a minute
it 's basically a big excuse to have fun and i'm sure that you will
bullied freshmen
check
a dorky music teacher
check
exploding mice
checkmatebr br anyway this is the sort of stuff that makes life worth living
even for someone like me who does n't know the ramones' music it 's pure pleasure
with roger corman executive producing and joe dante codirecting how could we expect anything less
too bad that director allan arkush later degenerated into fare such as caddyshack iibr br also starring pj
soles vincent van patten clint howard dey young dick miller don steele and of course the ramones
a real treatbr br it seems like bartel and woronov always costarred
they also costarred in joe dante 's hollywood boulevard and the slasher flick chopping mall in which they reprised their roles from eating raoul
i simply love this movie
i also love the ramones so i am sorta biased to begin with in the first place
there is n't a lot of critical praise to give this film either you like it or you do n't
i think it 's a great cult movie
this movie is awesome
sort of
it dosent really say much or do much but it is an awesome movie to watch because of how stupid it is
the high school is taken over by evil mstogar that hates the one thing that all the students love rock roll
riff randle get everyone tickets for the ramones show and this movie peaks with a take over of the school led my riff randle the ramones
this movie has everything a bad script questionable directing bad actors an awesome soundtrackextreme campyness these elements much more come together to make this what it isa classicbr br note during the live ramones set notice that darby crash of the germs is in the front of the crowd
neato
even if you 're not a big ramones fan rock 'n' roll high school is still the greatest rock 'n' roll movie ever made
why
because under all the campiness it treats with respect the contempt and loathing teens often feel for the boring stupid fascist establishment world of adults
that final scene is one of the most glorious and uplifting final scenes to a movie i have ever seen
mine eyes have seen the glory of the rock 'n' rollbr br
all the folks who sit here and say that this movie 's weak link is the ramones would probably say that amadeus was ok if not for that irritating harpsichordist
rock and roll high school was centered around the ramones
how anyone can watch this and not get a kick out of joey ramone eating bean sprouts backstage in an attempt to keep him in performing condition is obviously a wet blanket square daddyo
ms trogar exploding white mice the hall patrols instant classics
nevermind the riff randell characterbr br if you do n't like the ramones then you do n't know rock and roll and you do n't deserve to watch a movie called rock and roll high school
hello
this movie is well okay
just kidding
its awesome
it 's not a block buster smash hit
it 's not meant to be
but its a big hit in my world
and my sisters
we are rockin' rollers
go ramones
this is a great movie for me
huge ramones fan
i do like the ramones and i suppose if you hate them then besides being a avid bush supporter you might not like this classicbr br it 's immensely better than the sappy john hughes teen films and the like that littered the 80 's
infinitely better than the american pie 's that plague us nowbr br there are some other great high school films switchblade sisters fast times class of '84 three o'clock high and the cheesy yet gripping river 's edge
but rnrhs will always be my favorite because it 's the funniest and most fun plus you can get up and dance with itbr br i love you riff randellbr br 1010
rock 'n' roll high school was one of the best movies ever made
i think the only reason it was so awesome was because of the ramones
you could n't have made the same movie and put something like the sex pistols or the clash in place of the ramones it just would n't have been the same
dey young clint howard vincent van patten mary woronov paul bartel and the hall monters just added to the movie
the whole entire movie is about the ramones especially joey
so everybody showed see rock 'n' roll high school if your a huge fan of real punk
not the sissy new crap but the loud and fast kind
the kind only the ramones could do
rip joey ramone 19512001 dee dee ramone 19522002
though this movie is cheesiness at its best it is pulled off perfectly
this movie without a doubt has to be considered a modern classic
there are basically two kinds of movies i like movies with depth and mindless comedies where i can sit back and relax
this movie is a perfect example of the latterbr br a friend of mine turned me on to this movie shortly after its release
considering me to somewhat shallow he said to me you 've got to see this movie
it 's just your type of movie
foregoing the insult i started watching
i know they mentioned the ramones a million times but when you actually see them i said hey it is the ramones
my friend replied i do n't know they were a real band
i had my moment of glorybr br this movie though now somewhat dated is a must see for ramones fans or anyone else for that matter
just imagine what school would have been like in a world like this the kids are one big gang who have really good taste in music and unite against bad headmasters and teachers
rock 'n' roll high school is taking place in that world
it 's like a ramones record coming to life
the characters are all as silly innocent and charming as the ramones' songs and the music itself is of course fantastic
high school comedies have really changed over the years if you compare a movie like american pie with this late 70 's classic where no tasteless sex jokes are made at all
since a remake is apparently in the works it can probably be expected that the charm of the original will get lost along the way and will get replaced by vulgar halffunny dick jokes as bill hicks used to call them
however the main problem will be that the ramones cannot be replaced
they were the perfect band for this movie and no one else could even come close to taking their place
so the best thing to do would be to leave the original alone as quirky and charming as it is
gabbagabba hey
rock n roll high school holds a special place in my heart because it introduced me to the ramones
i was too young during the band 's mid70s heyday to be very aware of them although i had an older cousin who was a big fan at the time
i finally saw rnrhs on television one afternoon in the mid80s when i was about fifteen years old and laughed all the way through it
i recorded a subsequent airing of the film a year or two later and kept watching the ramones concert sequences over and over again thinking man these guys kick ass
i have to check out some of their albums
the rest is history
twenty years umpteen ramones lpscassettescds and three ramones shows later they 're still one of my all time favorite bands and rnrhs still cracks me up every time i watch it
now that joey dee dee and johnny have left us at least we have this movie and tons of great music to remember them by
one of b and cmovie producer roger corman 's greatest cult classics was the ramones vehicle rock n' roll high school
it 's just a simple technically dated story about teenagers who love rock n' rollbr br students at vince lombardi high school are met with resistance by the evil principal miss evelyn togar who fears that rock n' roll turns kids into uncontrollable amoral deviants and vows to make a rock n' rollfree zone
actually she intends to wipe out rock n' roll for all students regardless of whether its at school and she has the cooperation of most of the adults who might make the plan successfulbr br but not if riff randell can help it
a ramones fanatic she has written some songs that she wants to give to the ramones and in trying to do so is rebuffed by miss togar who does all she can to keep her from going to see the ramones play in town
it culminates into an ultimate revolt between the obsolete funhating adults and the teenagers
after the years of punk when the fame of garage rockers the ramones would mark another shift in music evolution it was great to see a movie that celebrated the fun of it all and in such a humorous exaggerated waybr br it is mostly mild comedy but a great feelgood comedy nonetheless when you 're in the mood for something more laid back to entertain you
with jerry zucker and joe dante both taking part in some of the directing you can get the idea for what kind of humor you 're in for
the story must 've later inspired by the mid90s comedy detroit rock city which some minor character changes in the vehicle for aged glam rockers kizzbr br i would recommend passing on the corey feldman vehicle rock n' roll high school forever released nearly a decade later
the original is still the best
riff randell is a wildly obsessed fan of the rock group the ramones and so are most of the students in the school
but a new tyrant of a principal ms togar thinks rock 'n' roll is a bad influence on the students especially the music from the ramones
so when riff finds out they 're performing in town she skips class for a couple of days to get tickets for herself and her friends
but when ms togar discovers why she really took those days off she confiscates the tickets
while this is happening tom roberts is totally love struck over riff but riff 's friend kate rambeau feels the same way about tom
but riff has her eyes set only on the lead singer joe ramone and hopefully in getting to that concert to get them to play her songbr br fun
fun
fun
yep that 's right 'rock n roll high school' does n't drift away from it main focus a boisterously daggy romp
it was n't what i was expecting that 's for sure
everyone participating in this dandy project looks like they 're having a great time and the relaxing nature of it shows on screen with the energy providing such a glowing spirit which makes it a priceless experience
that 's not to say i think its art and the plot is as pointless as can be
but watching this passionately crazy ride that escalates into some good harmless high jinks i just could n't wipe the grin off my face
it 's tacky very cheesy densely chaotic but damn it 's funkydory
br br this lowbudget bgrade feature from producer roger corman and john dante who was cowriter
is basically a glorious homage on the rocking 1950s flicks by sticking with the fruitful clichs and throwing into the stew the teenage rebellion tag because of the generation gap between them and the adults
these features might not be particularly fresh but they do rack up some appeal because of the dynamically gusto treatment
the film has just one thing on mind to go out on a bang
and they manage to do that
courtesy of 'the ramones' who play themselves
really you could say its one big trendy video clip since it 's all about the ramones well most of it anyway
i see a lot flack towards the ramones' acting ability
these are musicians not actors which means it 's not about their acting here it 's the music we 're suppose to dig
they 're here to perform
which they deliver in that front with some kick ass tracks that peppered the film to create a totally upbeat vibe
especially their flamboyant concert performances
the buzzing soundtrack also had some killer tunes from some other artists such as devo the velvet underground mc5 fleetwood mack eddie and the hot rods and alice cooper
but these jumping tracks fitted in well with the carefree feel and even the score was worked in rather well
especially in the scenes involving ms togar with the score grasping the right mood that surrounds her mind set
the playful mood of the film is pretty much like a roller coaster ride with such a racy pace between the electrifying tunes and comical segments ranging from scattered slapstick routines to it 's sometimes clever tongueincheek dialogue
thrown in for good measure is a variety of light and heavy gags which i found very pleasurable and it gave it such a wider range to express itselfbr br what else gave the film an added boost had to be the divine pj soles who gave such a bang up performance as the peachy riff randell
other exemplary performances were dey young as the extremely cute kate rambeau vincent van patten as the gawky tom roberts and the go to man eaglebauer who 's stupendously played by clint howard
also some top drawer corman regulars pop up with great send up performances by mary woronov who 's excellent as the demanding ms togar who 's pushing her unfair reign on the students paul bartel as mr mcgree and a small support role from dick millar towards the end
the enthusiastic acting is pretty campy but that goes down well with the material and there 's a certain likability stemming from these characters but we totally despise ms togar and her hall monitor goonsbr br there 's no beating around the bush here when i say 'rock 'n' roll high school' is an intoxicating hoot of a rad time
the movie is just plain fun maybe more fun for those of us who were young and fans of the ramones around the time the film was made
i 've watched the film over and over by myself and with friends and it is still fresh and funny
at the risk of being too serious the concept of being a big fan of a certain band is timeless and high school students boredom with drudgery of some classes is just as timelessbr br and the film has some gem linesscenes references to how our permanent record in high school will follow us through life
the famous static line the school board member who is so decrepit he 's attended by nurses the nazi hall monitors love for a body search principal togar announcing i give you the final solution and burning the ramones records and of course joey ramone noting things sure have changed since we got kicked out of high school followed by togar asking do your parents know you 're ramones
br br just one piece of advice do n't look up where the stars are now joey ramone sadly died young
dey young who was a major hottie in the film today reminds us we all age pj soles career never advanced as we might have expected marla rosenfield as one the other students apparently appeared only in this film though i submit her performance was more than adequate and should have brought her more teen film roles
and does anyone know what happened to dj don steele
br br so watch and enjoy do n't think just have fun
fascist principal miss togarhas a plan to turn her high completely square
complications ensue which challenge that goal in delightful rock'n'roller riff randellwho is an obsessive fan of the punk band the ramones
pal kate rambeaujoins forces with riff to put an end to the supposed crisis of killing rock'n'roll for good which is togar 's desired missionbr br vincent van patten has a hilarious role as tom roberts a success at everything but getting laid
kate is crazy about tom if only he could pull his head out of the sand and see it
clint howard steals the film almostas eaglebauer the supplier who can get everyone almost anything
his office is located in the boy 's restroom
paul bartel is also hilarious as a music teacher who becomes an ally of riff 's when he enjoys a concert of the ramonesbr br a raucous high school romp that defies all rules of normalcy and i loved it
it 's like someone just says let 's make life fun for 1 hours
the film really is anarchy a plotless chaos lovingly adoring the ramones with all it 's heartbr br the ending pretty much sums up the film as a whole riff and her classmates take over the high school and one massive party begins
to be honest i did n't want the party to end
not conventional in any way whatsoever this film just let 's loose a frenzy
accompanied by a great rock soundtrack featuring some of the ramones best songs this film allows a viewer to accept a time in life when war did n't dominate headlines and people just had a good time
those i guess were the days
vince lombardi high school has a new principalthe evil ms togar
she intends to ban rock and roll music all together
she butts head with riff randall who loves the ramones
also the head of the school football team ca n't seem to connect with any girlnot realizing cute kate rambeau is in love with himbr br an instant midnight movie
this was put in general release and almost immediately bombedbut as a midnight movie it was a huge hit and kept playing all through the 1980s
i remember attending more than a few of those when i was in collegeit was like a party
people were singing along with the songs laughing uproariously at every joke and generally just having funbr br seeing it now as an adult i ca n't imagine why i loved this so much
the script is juvenile and full of groaners that i could n't believe i was hearing
characters change at random and the movie goes jumping all over the place
what saves this are some truly funny lines and wonderful performances by soles and woronov
also everyone is full of energy and playing their roles way over the top
as for the ramones i was never a fan
i do like the title tune but the rest of the songs never really caught me
if you 're a ramones fan you might give this a higher ratingbr br spoiler warning
this is mostly for kids who will probably find it silly but fun
i especially think they 'll like the end when the high school is blown up
spoiler end
br br so if you 're in the mood for a silly midnight movie from the 1980s you might like this
otherwise stay away
i give it a 7
one of the best if not the best rock'n'roll movies ever
and it 's not just mindless fun
there really were a lot of clever jokes in it
of course i love the ramones
but with all the anarchy and the i hate high school themes the film does n't at all take itself too seriouslywhich is what 's great about itbr br i first saw the movie in the spring of 1980 and i saw it again recently
since i went to high school in the late 1970 's it made me kind of nostalgic
br br like i said this film does n't take itself that seriously and is n't pretentious like so much other teen fare of the seventies eighties and nineties
and to speak of it 's not really dirty or disgusting either
only pg rated
that 's rare for a movie in this category
a great cult classic and a truly incredible time capsule
the ramones whom i consider the founders of modern punk rock lend their thenunique sounds to a terrifically twisted movie about a rowdy rock fan who faces off against a merciless joyless principal for the right to rockbr br featuring a soundtrack brimming with incredible music rrhs is fascinating in concept and execution
it 's chock full of riotous sight gags teenage spirit and bizarre offthewall moments
if you 're looking for a movie that seems to be made of pure fun on a molecular level look no further
but if you 're looking for a nice dignified dramatic epic maybe you should look a wee bit furtherbr br hi everybody i'm riff randell and this is rock roll high school
i seriously love this film so much i never get sick of watching it
the only line i really ca n't stomach in this is when riff calls herself a teenage lobotomy but other than that everything else is perfect
i 've never been a fan of pj soles and it did n't help to hear that she did n't even know who the ramones were until she filmed this movie but i can ignore her snarly little face for the most part
most people who watch this over and over are fans of the ramones and really that 's the only reason i love it so much
i never get tired of seeing deedee mess up his pizza lines or joey mess up the name of the teacher over and over haha
one of the best parts of the film is seeing them sing do you want to dance down the halls of the high school i love it
the special edition dvd has a good retrospective surprisingly pj soles is n't on it
maybe she was working on another project laugh anyway great film even better if you 're a ramones fan
i liked this movie i remember there was one very well done scene in this movie where riff randell is lying in her bed smoking pot and then she begins to visualize that the ramones are in the room with her sing the song i want you around very very cool stuffbr br it was fun energetic quirky and cool
yes i 'll admit that the ending is wayway over the top and far fetched but it does n't matter because it is fun this is a very fun movie
it 's sex pot and rock n rocll foreverbr br i read that cheap trick was the band who was originally to star in this but i do not know if this is true or not
this movie is soooo funny
the acting is wonderful the ramones are sexy the jokes are subtle and the plot is just what every high schooler dreams of doing to hisher school
i absolutely loved the soundtrack as well as the carefully placed cynicism
if you like monty python you will love this film
this movie is a tad bit greaseesk
the songs that are sung are likable you might even find yourself singing these songs once the movie is through
this musical ranks number two in musicals to me
but please do not think of it as a musical per say seeing as how the songs are so likable it is hard to tell a carefully choreographed scene is taking place
i think of this movie as more of a comedy with undertones of romance
you will be reminded of what it was like to be a rebellious teenager needless to say you will be reminiscing of your old high school days after seeing this film
highly recommended for both the family since it is a very youthful but also for adults since there are many jokes that are funnier with age and experience
well i have finally caught up with rock 'n' roll high school almost 30 years after it first became a midnight movie sensation in 1979 and no the film does n't feel dated one bit and yes it was worth the wait
this is a very highenergy comedy that features loads of great music and some surprising moments
it tells the story of riff randell adorably played by pj
soles and the battle that she and her fellow students at vince lombardi high wage against their new repressive principal miss togar
a typical teens vs establishment story line is beefed up here with some absurdist humor and some truly rousing tunes
riff is of course the fan of that original punk band the ramones and that band dishes out a baker 's dozen of its greatest songs during the course of the film including five at a concert that is a total blast
indeed the sight of riff furiously dancing to teenage lobotomy at this blowout may be the picture 's funniest moment
and the initial appearance of joey johnny dee dee and marky in their ramonesmobile and later slinking down a street singing i just wanna have something to do is quite exhilarating
the film ends with an explosive confrontation that is i would imagine every high school kid 's wet dream
fun stuff indeed
on a side note the ramones were one of the loudest bands that i have ever seen in concert so i was very amused to note that the dvd for this film comes with optional english subtitles for the hearing impaired
how many aging punks out there found these subtitles necessary i wonder
how can you go wrong with the amazing ramones
what a crime that two of them are already dead
it reminds me of the dennis leary joke about great musicians dying in kitchen fires while useless ones live forever
i'm paraphrasing here but you get the ideabr br rock and roll high school tells the story of a group of disenfranchised kids fighting against their oppressive high school 's administration
it 's extremely silly stuff but there 's an optimism about it that 's refreshing
who knew that this would actually become a concern for students around the world
rock and roll high school is a time capsule of an era when people still believed that music mattered and that it could make a difference to the larger society
it 's full of kids who know authority does n't have the correct answers
rather rock and roll is the only thing they can trustbr br but most important this is pure exploitationbr br take none of it seriously
just go in and have a good time
if this was n't what high school life was like in the seventies then it should have been
this film is a jolt of punk rock fun from start to finish
the ramones reigning princes of late70s punk rock appear as themselves
pj soles stars as riff randle the rebellious high school girl who lives and breathes rock 'n roll
riff is obsessed with writing songs for the ramones her favorite rock band
she keeps the school rockin' and encourages her fellowstudents to join her in her jubilant anticsbr br meanwhile the school that riff attends has just hired a brandnew principal named ms togar
she 's a tall intimidating amazon of a woman
and she vows to make the students 'toetheline'
she even has a couple of the students act as monitors who report back to her with dirt on their classmates
ms togar is especially determined to nab riff and put a stop to riff 's anarchic shenanigans
but riff has clever ways to foil togar at every turnbr br kudos to the superb performance of mary woronov in her role as principal togar
mary is a legendary b movie actress
and in this film she plays the fascist ms togar with sneering relish
pj soles as riff turns in an electrifying performance
clint howard as the duplicitous eaglebauer has lots of fun with his rolebr br the ramones perform many of their hit songs in this film
and so the viewer sees why the ramones were so influential in the 70s punk rock scene
certainly this is a good film for ramones fans
but even if you 're not into the ramones or punk rock this movie is a terrific blast of energetic fun
marvelous cult film from 1979 in which the students of vince lombardi high school are confronted with a new dictatorial principal named miss togar
togar is a music hater and blames the musical tastes of the students for their transgressions
leading the charge against her is funloving riff randell the ramones fan who more than anything wants the rock group to record her songsbr br now this is an impossible movie to resist
first and foremost the soundtrack is incredible with songs by such artists as alice cooper and the velvet underground in addition to the infectious nonstop assortment of ramones songs
teenage lobotomy sheena is a punk rocker and blitzkrieg bop are just a few of them
next the cast truly gives it their all with soles an ideal choice for the role of riff she is a true delight
vincent van patten and dey young are earnest as tom and kate woronov is well cast against type as the snooty and disdainful togar clint howard has one of his best ever parts as washroomoccupying entrepreneur eaglebauer and new world regulars such as dick miller paul bartel and the real don steele are fun as always
and of course it 's a treat to see the ramones playing themselvesbr br the movie has true spirit
the energy level is high with costory author and director allan arkush bringing a great deal of flair to the proceedings
there 's also a great sense of humor
the paper airplane gag is a superb example of this
this extends right to the wipe style of scene transitions
there are even hilarious giant mice created by future makeup effects notable rob bottin in one of his earliest gigsbr br about as good as an authoritydefying defendone 'srighttoparty film can get
rock 'n' roll high school is quite simply a wonderful cult filmbr br 810
a must for any punk rocker this is the movie that made the ramones a household name back in the early 1980 's
this was one of the first and best of the american punk rock movies with a cult classic status up there with the rocky horror picture show
originally the producers wanted cheap trick as the stars but the release of the live at budakon album had just made them superstars and too hot an item to be in a low budget movie
very good luck for the ramones who were looking to break out of the underground punk rock world and into the mainstream market
the band dee dee especially always disliked the movie through the 80 's but the fans always loved and could recite most of the movie while waiting to get into ramones shows
this movie like most classics is stupid fun with some classic ramones footage in their heyday
do n't expect more you wo n't find it
it 's great fun so enjoy it
another allan arkush classic movie in a similar vein is get crazy featuring lee ving from the legendary hardcore punk band fear
it 's amazing that actress pj
soles did n't become a big star after playing riff randall fan of the punk rock group the ramones in rock 'n' roll high school
soles is so exuberant you do n't mind she 's obviously too old to still be in high school
the movie is a fastpaced frolic that does n't copout everything gets blown to smithereens at the end and that 's just as it should be
mary woronov an innately kinky and funny presence as the nazilike principal gets a great oneofakind bit at the beginning where frisbees fly dangerously close to her head and dey young is very appealing as soles' best kate rambeau
the weakest link ironically enough in this high school chaingang is the ramones
they ca n't act they 're not funny and their concert segment goes on too long
one ramones song i want you around is treated as a fantasy and is well captured other incidental songs are good particularly a rare paul mccartney ballad heard near the beginning
great fun
from
and this is a great rock'n'roll movie in itself
no matter how it evolved it ended up as one of the ultimate movies in which kids want to rock out but the principal stands in their way
think back to those rock'n'roll movies of the 50 's in which the day is saved when alan freed comes to town with chuck berry to prove that rock roll music is really cool and safe for the kids and tuesday weld gets a new sweater for the dance
forward to the 1979 repeat the same plot but throw in da ramones whom no one then realized would become one of the most influential bands of the next quarter century
throw in too all the elements of a roger cormanproduced comedyexploitation film except for the twoday shooting schedule some of the familiar corman repertory players like clint howard mary wournow and dick miller and you 've got one of the great stoopid movies of the day
one of the few films that uses deliberate cheesiness and gets away with it
i showed the new dvd to a friend who could only remember seeing parts of it through a stoner induced haze at the drivein and he agreed that this is one of the great movies to be watching drunk not the least for the lovely leading ladies and the great ramones footage
i have been a jodie foster fan ever since we were both kids from her disney years
i loved her tomboy antics in films like candleshoebr br foxes was such a huge departure from all of thatbr br where other young female actors of that era turned to sexual puerility disguised as comedy jodie went for a depressing and tragic tale of teens dragged to their demise by the powerful allure of temptation and addictionbr br this was not disney
this was not porky 's
this was not halloweed
this was a dark powerful story of the destruction of young lives
sadly it 's a tale that still plays out on a daily basis all over the country this film could be replayed and still be wholly relevantbr br it 's not the best film ever made it is tired at some parts not all the performances are particularly outstanding
but jodie foster continued to show her chops as a real adult actor br br 7 out of 10 barky
foxes is a serious look at the consequences of growing up too fast in the 1980s
and unlike the teen sex comedies that overshadowed it the movie holds up well against timebr br its theme of teen angst is as relevant today as it was 25 years ago and jodie foster and sk8er boi scott baio lead a fine young cast that 's well worth watchingbr br the film follows four southern california girls as they move through a rootless existence of sex and drugs and devoid of parents
the teens spend their days in and out of school and their nights at parties concerts or out on the street
seldom are they home because instant gratification is a pill party or boy awaybr br but rather than condemning them the film is sympathetic blaming absent uncaring adults for forcing the teens to grow up alone
and the charismatic cast is impossible to dislikebr br the film 's opening a long and loving pan sets the tone for what follows
we see the girls asleep at daybreak amid the objects that define teen girlhood from twinkies to a picture of a young john travola while donna summer 's on the radio is scored beneathbr br from there the movie picks up speed as the girls head off to school and to life
annie is the wild child who lives for the next party or pill
deirdre is the boy crazy drama queen
madge is the shy girl in over her head
and foster is the one with the plan
it 's her job to keep this crew together long enough to finish high school while also holding her divorced and desperate man hunting mother in line br br it 's an almost impossible job and one that foster ultimately fails atbr br despite its age foxes remains a pleasure to watch
dated hair clothes and references to olympic skater dorothy hamill have n't hurt the moviebr br the cinematography is simply stunning with breathtaking filtered shots of the la basin at dawn dusk and at night
giorgio moroder adds a 80s soundtrack featuring the likes of donna summer and janis ianbr br perhaps the movie 's biggest disappointment is that the young stars around foster never broke out like the casts of st elmo 's fire or empire records
foxes shows why they should have
but perhaps like bowling for soup 's song 1985 they just hit a wall
i was just a bit young for this one but i had to see it
there 's some excellent music which many folks have mentioned but no one seems to notice a very rare appearance by angel a now mostly ignored but once quite popular musical outfit
wearing their trademark white outfits they grind through 20th century foxes and apparently all try to cram into the camera 's field of vision
keyboardist gregg giuffria remains the bands highlight and has apparently never gotten much of a haircut ever
cherie currie begins a brief but notable acting career here and is quite memorable alongside jodie foster and the rest
br br it 's not a masterpiece but it preserves a chunk of its period for all to gaze upon and wonder
coming of age movies are quite usual these days
for 1980 foxes really gives its meaning
jodie foster plays her character straight out
ever since she did taxi driver four years earlier she has a stronger character in this movie
she 's jeanie a high schooler who has plenty of guts and seems to get out of any situation she 's in
scott baio plays brad way before chachi on happy days
he 's deemed immature by the other girls
cherie currie is annie hangs with the wrong crowd chased by her policeman father
jeanie and her three other friends decide to live on the wild side until they move into a rented house where a party get totally out of hand
exploring life on the other side of the tracks can be either fun or dangerous
annie is rescued by jeanie and brad all the time whenever she gets wasted
reality comes back hard where she is killed in a automobile accident
and one gets married to a much older man
growing up is n't easy sometimes we got to explore life how it is
in reality you got to be careful about the people surrounding you
for me i was my own person and i tend to stay that way
great music great plot this movie 's a gem
4 out of 5 stars
this work is striking in its accurate depiction of teenage life at the time of its execution
though this is a broad generalization parents of that time were too selfabsorbed to be real parents and those who were home tended to be far too distracted from the real issues where their children were concerned
br br this film teaches us how to let go even when it is painful and does so with a sweet melancholy but informed style whereby foster talks philosophically about feeling the pain of life
i loved that scene
it was my favorite scene in the movie actuallybr br the transition from funeral to wedding was meant to show that life does go on and so must we
baio 's skateboarding through a pack of goons and outrunning them was meant to show us that the troubled times will pass and we are meant to get through them to better timesbr br the whole metaphor of moving on and the procession of life is present throughout the film and serves to give us hope in the endbr br i like this movie though i do not watch it often as it tends to make me melancholybr br it should n't be viewed by young children and probably only those raised in the 1970 's80 's would want tobr br it rates a 7410 from br br the fiend
foxes is one movie i remember for it 's portrayal of teenagers in the late 1970 's
as i am exactly jodie foster 's age i related to this movie
it deals with the frustrations temptations relationships rebellion of youth
the soundtrack is great with inspiring rock eg
more than a feeling by boston and sad numbers like on the radio by donna summer
the music of my late teens
yep i 'll always remember this one even if it was n't huge
foxes is a great film
the four young actresses jodie foster cherie currie marilyn kagan and kandice stroh are wonderful
the song on the radio by donna summer is lovely
a great film
as i reach the backside of 35 i find myself shaking my head more and more at the sex crazed drug influenced teens of today
it was great to be reminded that it was just as crazy for me back in my day as it is for teens today
this film drives that point home to the core
if you are a late 70 's fan you 'll love the film
from kissposters to an angel concert this movie rocks
br br watch for a young laura dern
why they did n't have more songs from the runaways i 'll never know
br br i did have a problem with randy quaid 's character deflowering a 16 year old girl
while he was away she and her friends have a party that destroys dude 's house
the cops come and everything but no mention of all the underage drinking and how these kids got their hands on this stuffbr br foxes belongs right there with over the edge fast times dazed confused and kids as one of the all time teen angst flicksbr br i say buy it and watch it with your kids and talk about it all
although i was born in the year that this movie came out and had never heard of it until my junior year of high school when i saw it i became totally engrossed laughing and crying and feeling along with the characters because me and my friends were thembr br their hair clothes and speech were outdated but the emotions and the desperation of each situation were so familiar
i remember thinking how real it was and how i wished that they would make movies like that stillbr br in fact i saw this movie the night after i had been at a crazy party which had been crashed by what we considered the loser derelicts who hung out on the fringes of our crowd
a world class bs'er and responsible mother figure type i identified immediately with jeanie although i had a little bit of madge 's insecurities floating around in there too
my best friend was a deidre and her good friend from childhood was our anniebr br watching the scene when jeanie is in school or the one where her and her boyfriend break up and then she is telling madge how much she loved him felt like conversations and situations i had personally hadbr br now at the age of 27 i recently saw the movie again and felt a surge of emotions because it was like watching back a piece of my own youth
i think this is a must see for all girls 13 and up
this is 2009 and this way underrated gem has lost nothing of the power it had 31 years ago
it connects a pretty wide variety of different characters and stories without appearing to be clutteredbr br clothes and music might have changed over time but in the end this is a story that will never lose its uptodateness
and especially this movie does the job pretty well
of course it is cheesy at times but very touching as wellbr br jodie foster 's performance is striking and it shows that she is really a natural born actress who showed her true potential especially in her earlier moviesbr br do n't miss this one
this is one of the most underrated masterpieces of all time in my opinion its thought provoking funny and sad with amazing performances all around
all the characters are wonderful and the story is just brilliant plus jodie foster and cherie currie are simply amazing in this
the ending is very powerful however i wo n't spoil it for you and i thought the character development was top notch plus you can really relate to all of the characters especially jeanie and annie as you will be rooting for them plus i loved how it moved slowly and giving you a chance to get to know all the characters and what there about
i ca n't believe this only has a 59 rating on here as it should be much higher in my opinion and it was funny seeing randy quaid in this type of role plus this is extremely well written and made as well
one scene that really got to me was when madge is totally embarrassed by her mother for having the party and the film has many surprising moments as well plus the dialog is especially excellent
this is one of the most underrated masterpieces of all time its thought provoking funny and sad with amazing performances all around and i say go see it immediately your bound to love it
the direction is fantastic
adrian lyne does a fantastic job here with awesome camera work and keeping the film at an extremely engrossing pace
the acting is amazing
jodie foster is really cute and is amazing as always she was extremely likable caring had a lovable character was intense in some scenes was focused and she and cherie currie were the heart of the film as jeanie and annie
cherie currie is way hot and is amazing here i really felt sorry for her character as she had a very likable character that just needed help she gives a powerful performance and created a very memorable character she was amazing
scott baio is great as brad he was really likable and did his job well i liked him
randy quaid is great in his serious role surprisingly i liked him
sally kellerman is great as the mother i liked her a lot
marilyn kagan and kandice stroh are both very good as madge and deirdre and did what they had to do well as the other two friends
laura dern has a very early role here as it was cool to see her not much of a part though
rest of the cast do fine
overall go see it immediately it 's an underrated masterpiece
out of 5
jodie foster cherie currie marilyn kagan and kandice stroh are uniformly believable splendid and touching as the titular quartet who are a tightknit clique of troubled fiercely loyal adolescent girls with negligent uncaring selfabsorbed parents who do their best to grow up and fend for themselves in the affluent san fernando valley california suburbs
the girls are forced to make serious decisions about sex drugs alcohol commitment and so on at a tender young age when they 're not fully prepared to completely own up to the potentially harmful consequences of said decisions
foster giving one of her most perceptive affecting and underrated performances to date is basically the group 's den mother who presides over the wellbeing of both herself and the others she 's especially concerned about the goodhearted but reckless and selfdestructive currie whose carelessly hedonistic lifestyle makes her likely to meet an untimely endbr br this picture offers a poignant insightful often devastatingly credible and thoroughly absorbing examination of broken dysfunctional families which exist directly underneath suburbia 's neatly manicured surface and the tragic net result of such families tough resilient but unhappy and vulnerable kids who have to confront the trials and tribulations of growing up on their own because their parents are either too inconsiderate or even nonexistent
adrian lyne 's direction is both sturdy and observant while gerald ayres' script is somewhat messy and rambling but overall still accurate in its frank gritty unsentimental depiction of your average latchkey kid 's nervewrackingly chaotic capricious and unpredictable everyday life
leon bijou 's soft dewy almost pastoral cinematography properly suggests a delicate and easily breakable sense of tranquility and innocence
giorgio moroder arranged the excellent score which makes particularly effective use of donna summer 's elegiac on the radio
the topnotch cast includes sally kellerman as foster 's neurotic insecure peevish mother scott baio as a sweet skateboarder dude randy quaid as kagan 's rich older boyfriend british 60 's pop singer adam faith as foster 's feckless absentee rock promoter father and lois smith as kagan 's smothering overprotective mother
appearing in brief bits are robert romanus as one of foster 's morose exboyfriends and a gawky braceswearing laura dern as an obnoxious party crasher
achingly authentic engrossing and deeply moving foxes is quite simply one of the most unsung and underappreciated teen movies made about early 80 's adolescence
this is one of the best jodie foster movies out there and largely ignored due to the general public 's misconception of it as a teen flick
it has wonderful performances particularly a fight scene between jodie and her mother played by a convincing sally kellerman
the three girls that play jodie 's friends are somewhat amateurish but i do think it is worth seeing
four teenage girls in a suburb of los angeles get into all kinds of trouble parties drugs cops mixedup parents older boyfriends
jodie foster sort of the mother hen of the pack tries keeping everyone together like a family and the heartbreaking thing about the movie is that she ca n't
slowly everyone grows up and goes away
that precise plot point though underscored throughout is unfortunately tampered with
did we really need a long sequence with scott baio outracing a car full of thugs on his skateboard
or an even longer sequencealso with baiowhere foster has a strange soliloquy about the pain of illusion
some of the dialogue in fact is downright loopy and i did n't much care for an edit late in the film that segues clumsily from a death to a wedding
but these are nitpicks in what is basically a very sensitive story about the loss of a tight bond
and jodie 's face at the ending speaks volumes
if viewers do get choked up at the end the movie has earned this
it does n't pander for tears or ask for sympathy
it shows us an example of friendship and hopes we understand
from
story about four teenage girls growing up in california
jeanie is the most levelheaded of the bunchbut wants to move out of her house where she lives with her divorced mother
annie is addicted to drugs alcohol and bad boys and is beaten up by her father
madge has overprotective parents
deirde thinks she 's more mature than the rest of thembr br this is nothing new from what we 've seen plenty of times beforebut this one has one big differenceit 's accurate
i graduated from high school in 1980 and i was surprised at how realistic it was
they got the dialogue clothes and attitudes down completely right
even the main song of the movie was a big hit before this came out
this film hit me harder than any other teen film of the time because i could understand and relate to the characters
i knew girls in high school who were just like this
the film is dated but it captures a time we will never see againbr br the acting is good on all counts with foster giving the best performance
the relationship between her and kellerman was realistic and welldone
even scott baio more or less realistically played a teen boybr br a very good movieessential viewing if you came of age in 1980 the film has a deserved r rating but should be seen by all teens
i give it a 8
if you were n't there then unfortunately this movie will be beyond compassion for you
which as i say is a shame because although some of the acting is amateurish it is meant to be for realism
let 's face itin real life we do n't say things in an exacting or perfect way even when we mean to
in this sense it works
this however does not apply to our known actors in this film notably jodie foster
the fact that the other 3 girls are not accomplished only adds to the storyjodie plays the glue that struggles to keep their friendship close even with the obvious feeling of fatality
meaning that no matter how close friends are eventually there are some people that just fade away no matter how you trybr br and therein is the core of the movie
it 's not about partying it 's not about sexuality but about these 4 girls and their final time as still young girls before they have to go the world alonebr br if you have ever had a friendship like that in your life you will feel this movieit will mean a lot to you no matter what era it is set in or what era you grew up in
we all knew these girls in school or at the very least knew of them
we all knew the frustrated virgin half wanting to hold onto childhood and half wanting desperately to grow up and thinking that will do it for her
we all knew the boycrazy one the fashion plate whose vanity hides her fear of the world her fear of acceptance
we all knew the party girl the one they whispered about with tales of not only her sad home life but of her notorious exploits
and we all knew the mother figure the one a little more real a little more grounded a little more sad because she knew what would happen
maybe you were one of those girls
maybe like me you had been each one at one time or another br br this film really captures that fragile time in life when want needs pressures womanhood childhood the world and loneliness are all embodied in each female 's head each factor on the precipice
which aspect do you hang on to
what do you toss over the edge no matter how you may want to hold on
and how painful is goodbye to everything you 've known
that 's what this movie issteps into womanhood while clinging onto childhood and how damn tough it is to keep walking
if you were there you know and love this film as i do
aching and tenderly done
a fine piece of captured femininity
dirty sanchez is the more extreme british version of jackass in which the four boys go to great lengths to hurt and humiliate each other
the reason this show is better than jackass is because most of the stunts are not planned which makes the reaction much more funny
there are 3 series of the show the first follows them around and takes a long look at their lives eg
there 's an episode on their love livesjobs etc
the second series sends the boys to try out different occupations
the third follows their european tour
it seems that the boys get more and more daring as the show progresses through the series
in my opinion the third series is the best but trust me when i say if you have a week stomach do not watch as you are lightly to see a fair amount of blood and puke in every episode
i have to say although i despise these kind of shows shock horror i'm a girl i feel i have to express my opinion
i had seen dirty sanchez before i saw jackass and think it way surpasses jackass in terms of programme making
story lines and interviews are inter weaved to create a more interesting show
i saw a few minutes of jackass movie the other night and could n't believe how poorly put together it was everything just put in a line joke after joke with no relation between anything
it must have been the quickest easiest show to edit ever shockingly amateur
while drinking puke is n't really my thing as far as a substantial entertainment show goes dirty sanchez is way out of jackass 's league
i need to be honest
i watched and enjoy this show because it was gross offensive hilarious and raunchy
yeah there is a lot of humor for all tastes
if you are into the kind of humor that deals with making fun of people falling from skateboards for example then you will have a great time for itbr br or if you enjoy people on extreme stunt actions going bad you will also have a great time
and if you enjoy scatological humor and extreme situations oh you will enjoy the showbr br i enjoy all three kinds of humor that dirty snchez offers
i like to have a hard laugh with the situations of the show
jackass is like a walk in the park compared to this one
so if you are tired of the typical american stupidity of jackass give it a try to english extreme stupidity on this show
with all due respectbr br this is a show that has little taste or class
it 's not recommended for those who are easily offended or grossed outbr br now these guys need to see a psychologist
specially the paco character
i knew about this as a similar programme as jackass and i saw one or two episodes on freeview and it is the same only more extreme
basically three welsh guys and one mad british bloke were brought together by love of skateboarding and a complete disregardmasochistic pleasure to harm themselves and their health and safety
they have had puking eating pubescovered pizza jumping in stinging nettles naked paint balling jokes on the smaller guy while heavily sleepingsnoring stunts in a work place eg
army cowboys and many more insane stunts that cause bruises bumps blood and vomit maybe not just for themselves
starring matthew pritchard who does pretty much anything lee dainton also up for just about anything dan joyce who hardly does much physical stuff and has a ott laugh and pancho who does a lot but is more popular for being short fat and lazy
it was number something on the 100 greatest funny moments
very good
to many people beat street has inspired their lifestyle to something creative concerning the hip hop culturebr br the young lee is living in ny in the 80 's when hip hop was at its beginning
his a crew member of beat street a bboy crew
the movie follows lee in his average day dancing graffitiing etcbr br the director has succeeded in making a movie with a plot and at the same time presenting hip hop to the rest of the world
the movie has old school features such asbr br afrika bambaataa the soul sonic force grandmaster melle mel the furious five the rock steady crew the new york city breakers and many more br br neither the movie beat street nor the beat street spirit will ever die
i had not seen this movie since the late '80s and decided to pick up the vhs version of it
the plot is very slow and the actors almost seem robotic in this breakdance flick
the music hip hopfreestyle artists and the breakdancing scenes are what make this movie special
the breakdancing is actually better in this movie than in breakin' but i have to say that breakin' 12 carry the energy excitement to the screen a lot better
it 's a movie i will keep in my library but it 's not a movie that i can watch over over again just once in a blue moon
i just wanna say that amongst all the socalled classic hiphop films ive seen like wild style krushgroove breakin' style wars etc imo beat street is the best amongst the others
whenever i ask other people about which is their fave then it seems that beat street pops out the most
but still its the lowest ranked of all
43 is just a punch under the belt
i love the music performances the breakdancing makes me wanna spin ramo makes me wanna throw a piece c'mon its a classic
i enjoy watching people doing breakdance especially if they do it as well as in the best scenes of this movie which takes you to a disco club called roxy
especially at christmas time because there also appears a mc santa clausbr br even if this is an old film and even if i have videotaped it from tv when the state movie archive of finland showed this in the summer of 2004 on their own big screen i went there to check it out
it 's much more enjoyable on big screen than on tvbr br even if many people here think that watching this on big screen is a waste of money for the ticket cost i disagree with this and i think that when i paid my ticket i got the money 's worth by seeing this as it is on big screen especially seated on front row of the cinema an unforgettable experience and much better than just on video
this movie changed it all for me i heard of breakdancing and hiphop but had never seen it professionally done when i saw this movie this all changed
i got actively involved in the hiphopmovement in our city started breakdancing and writing lyricsbr br to this day i still consider this movie to be a personal favorite
sure the filming and cinematographic importance might not be that significant
but who cares if the wideshot was filmed badly or if you could see a mic hanging above somebody
it 's what it does to you personally that counts
without doubt beat street is the best film about the breakin scene
everything about it is spot onthe clothes the music and most importantly the dancing
the storyline is basicbut hey whats there to tell a story about
the whole point of the film is to show what kids of that moment in time were doingwhat mattered to them
it shows that teenagers in general are goodall that mattered to these everyday kids was musicdancing and friendship
having watched the dvd recently i was plesantly surprised how well it had stood the test of time
the clothes did n't look dated the music still sounds freshand the dancing is still captivating to watch
a film anyone 1025 years of age should see as part of their youth culture
i guess when beat street made a national appearance flashdance came at the same time
the problem with flashdance is that there was only one break dancing scene and the rest was jazz dance and ballet
that was one of the reasons why beat street was better
the only movie that could rival beat street seems to be footloose because both movies focused on how dance had been used by people to express their utmost feelingsbr br the breakdance scenes in beat street come just before the middle and at the end of the flick
and i loved all of them
almost all of the break tricks were featured in the break jam scenes the jackhammer the flares the head spins the suicide sit the crazy legs the mortal the forward flip the figure fouralmost everythingbr br like the warriors beat street does have violence related to the gang life in the hip hop world but in a much less violent way than the former
the only major fight scene in beat street was when graffiti artist ramon is chased by a rival gang member on the new york city subway tracks fighting each other on the third rail and both dying by electrocution on that rail
well although that chase scene ended tragically it was better that they died that way than having blood exploding from a gang gunshotbr br most of the gang stuff in the flick was graffiti related to the hiphop culture and rap music
a lot of rap music appeared in the flick because hiphop members used rap music as a diversion to the negative aspects of gang life
even the theme song of the movie which closed the curtain to the flick was not just an homage to hiphop cultureit also was an homage to the death of ramonbr br by the way during the dance scene called 'tango tango' i guess the female drummer in the pit orchestra conducted by actress rae dawn chong was sheila e making a cameo appearance
this started out to be a movie about the street culture of the bronx in new york
what it accomplished was to give birth to a new culture and way of life for american youth
what other movie has done this except rebel without a cause
one of the most important movies of all time
the elements are simple yet fascinating
the story is timeless young people try to succeed against all odds
yet the story is always believable and never depressing
the characters are so realistic a city dweller would recognize them as neighbors
the story is entertaining and comes to a satisfying ending
buy this one for your permanent collection
it is a piece of american history
being that i am a true product of the hiphop and electronic dance music generation this is without a doubt one of my favorite movies of all time
beat street although not as authentic in some respects as wild style is a film that is guaranteed to tug the heart strings of anyone who takes pride in the culture of urban sampledjbased music and electroclub culturebr br although i will admit that at times the dialogue is somewhat cheesy you ca n't help but feel for the characters and ultimately wish you were there for the beginnings of hiphop culture in new york city in the early eighties
the bboy battle scene at the roxy nightclub is just as essential to a hiphop fan 's archives as any classic album
watch some of the breakers' moves in slowmotion if possible to truly appreciate the athletic and stylistic expertise of a seasoned bboybgirl
all praises due to the zulu nation
cinematically this film stinks
so does a lot of the acting
but ibr br do n't care
if there is a strong representation of what the 80 's werebr br like and what hiphop zulubr br nation and break dancing were really likegreat music greatbr br dancing
it almost seems like a documentary of a time now pastbr br when hiphop was a way of life
it 's also interesting to see newbr br york looking like ground zero from a nuclear attack
some viewersbr br may be too young to remember that it was a poor run down citybr br during the 70 's and 80 's
this is the best of all the hiphopbreakbr br dancing movies that came out around that period
of course thebr br 80 's are considered a joke now with all the bad tv shows andbr br movies but those of us who lived through it will always rememberbr br it fondly for a time when music dancing and graffiti were fresh yo
of all the breakdancing hiphop films released between 1983 and 1986 the 1984 film beat street is unquestionably the best one
the story follows a dj his younger breakdancing brother a graffiti artist and a wannabe showbiz promoter through one winter in which they try to break out of the ghetto using their street talent
the acting is n't always up to par and the characters are n't fully drawn out but they are more than compensated for by downtoearth dialogue a plausible story fantastic dancing sequences and a timeless hiphop sound track
it should be noted this film was shot in the birthplace of breakdancing and features appearances by the fathers of breakdancing dance troupe rock steady crew and rapper afrika bambaata
rock steady crew provide the best scene in the film when they dominate a dance battle at the premiere breakdancing club of the early 80 's the roxy
a must see for hiphop lovers
i love tudor chirila and maybe that 's why i enjoyed the movie so much
two days before the movie premiere i went to see his concert
i saw the trailer and the video zmeu before the movie and i thought i had it all figured i was wrong instead of a good movie i assisted a great one
i felt the movie
it was sad it was funny but most of all it pictured love i ca n't even begin to describe the soundtrack so i wo n't i'm not a movie critic i ca n't describe it in more words my kinda vague description is all because the play left me speechless thank god for the keyboard thank you tudor giurgiu thank you maria popistasu thank you ioana barbu and thank you tudor chirila
encore
i viewed the movie together with a homophobic friend my wife and her female friend
so i had views from all kinds of directions
mainly the film made me laugh the sexual tension was not really there and the only noticeable actors were tudor chirila and maria popistasu
yes i do think she played her role well even if the script was not appropriate
there were good romanian actors around they just did n't have complex roles
i applaud puya 's entering the movie business
i do n't know why but i think he 's a good guy i just hope he 'll be a good actorbr br the wife loved the movie though and i think there might have been chords being played and to which i had no ear for
if the film tried to present uncommon sexual behaviors and their consequences in todays romania then it failed miserably
there were no consequences
just imagine that the girls are actually a boy and a girl and the same story becomes just a boring uninteresting plotbr br i have no idea why it got all those bafta awards
in my book it should have gotten the better luck next time award
love is overwhelming in all it 's manifestations gorgeous absolutely gorgeous tudor chirila maria popistasu and ioana barbu one truly dramatic story about love in all it 's shapes a story about the undecipherable ways of young hearts about life and lost innocence all directed by the skillful eye of tudor giurgiu
with a magnificent soundtrack featuring faultline chris martin and vama veche it surprises in every way leaving behind the sour taste of misunderstanding love truly remarkable is it me or is romanian cinematography slowly but surely advancing and gaining respect
this is a brilliant film two thumbs up to everybody involved
i expected something differentmore passiondrama again another failed attempt of originalityi'm sorry to say that the film falls into the old clich of 'cheesiness'15 year old teens may appreciate it thoughthe acting was not very convincing and the lines commonlacking any witstill the soundtrack was good and well adaptedi ca n't say that this movie is a total flopbecause people do watch it but it did n't meet the public 's expectations and sunk into mediocritysoto concludethe production keeps you in front of the tv for almost an hour and a halfwhich is an appreciable thingthusi guess its worth seeing if you do n't get annoyed
i think it is a nice movie i think it is a very romanian movie through scenery and atmoshpere i think it was not intended to be sensual i think it is very natural i think it is humane i think it was interesting i think the actors never made me think waw lame acting neither is the film a block buster they are like the movie normal ppl that can act i think the movie reached its intention i think it made me feel things i think i'm not objectivebr br i really enjoyed it that i know
it 's a strange yet somehow impressive story about love
personnaly i never run over such a twistoff story in real life
but i can image there isbr br it 's a story that promises to be sick from the title
but after i watch it i did n't get this feeling of sickness which i would surely have regarding society rules
it 's something beautiful in this movie something impressive which i cannot contradict using any moral or society rulesbr br the movie focuses mostly on relation between kiki and alex
you can see how this relation starts evolves and finally ends
you feel the moment when this love blossoms the first whispers touchings
you feel the connection
and no moment i though this is immoral
you even hope it will not break in the end it cannot break it 's not right
you feel the pain of being hart broken in the end br br buti need also to add a negative spin to this comment i do n't know if the story is not somehow showed to give the feeling that these relations are sick only in form but not in content
you do n't have the total story but only fragments
when movie has started the relation between kiki and sandu was already in place
so no clue about the nature of the relation
you feel only a tension between them a fight between the need for love and desire to break this relation
i think this line of kiki to sandu says all i want to stop and if you love me you will do as i ask youbr br this movie will probably stir some questions about what is love and what is to be moral and where 's the limit between them
i do n't know if the idea of this movie is love conquers all even social and moral standards or love is beautiful no matter how or where
but in my opinion this movie is already a success for the simple reason that it makes you think
i think that the idea of the plot is perfect for exploring first of all the emotional experiences of the people involved and second as someone else wrote in a comment the implications of this kind of relationships in the romanian societybr br so to begin with the second aspect to make it short it was n't visible at all br br as for the first as i said it had much more potential i think that those kind of relationships carry much more tension much more tension and the potential tension did n't get through br br i think the soundtrack could 've been more than those few songs on the background and the theme yeah i could feel the absence of a better soundtrack br br the actors i think that they were somewhere from 7 to 810 not enough sensuality in the key moments br br a total of 710 mostly for the story
i saw this film at the chicago reeling film festival
to pick up on the previous reviewer 's remarks the claustrophobic feel and off colors of the film is i sense quite intentional and conveys the sense of limited space drab architecture overall drabness that constitutes the urban environment of most people in eastern and central europe
a bit shabby housing project style is how i 'd describe it and this is how many people live on the outskirts of larger cities
i ca n't say that i'm familiar with bucharest romania where the action unfolded but i have visited and lived in eastern europe for six months
br br when i visited russia as a student for a semester my entire group had to drag their luggage seven stories up the staircase of a shabby student dorm building just as the heroine does when moving in with a woman because the elevators were n't working
but i do concur with the reviewer that the claustrophobia and muted colors it 's overdone for there are to be sure beautiful historic buildings parks squares you can find in bucharest or in any historic city center of eastern europe and bucharest 's did n't get much of any footage in this film
for me watching this film conveys well the claustrophobia that i would feel during my halfyear stay there feeling trapped and limited
br br also given the climate of homophobia say circa us in the 1980s the two young women who fall in love with one another are forced to keep their love a very private matter hence the focus on their interaction in the apartmentbr br it 's remarkable and commendable in my view that this queer themed film was even made in romania and i find the complaint of the previous reviewer about the poor film quality quite uninformed and patronizing
it 's unlikely that the director and producer drummed up much government support and funding for their film and they did the best they could with their likely limited resources
the actors were fairly good and believable the dialog was overall well done and i could identity with these womenbr br the film offers an added twist to that of forbidden love between two young women kiki an energetic funloving free spirit with a dark troubling secret falls in love with alexandra a bright bookish idealistic young woman who moves to bucharest to begin her college studies
opposites attract and their personalities seem to complement one another though there is some tension between the ambitious studious intellectual alexandra and kiki who seems to be attending college to please her parents
keeping their love hidden from their parents seems manageable though we do n't get any sense of the tension it requires nor do we ever see or meet any other studentshard to believeand the tension keeping their love secret would have entailed
the chief threat to their love is kiki 's brother and her difficulty in trying to severe her relation to him
but kiki 's love for alexandra seems to give her the strength she needs to finally severe this bond or does it
that 's what the suspense of the film focuses on as the narrative develops and i wo n't say how it concludesbr br ironically kiki 's love sickness is n't love for another woman but her illicit incestuous love for her brother
thus loving a woman offers the potential cure to the sickness of loving a sibling
br br though this feel of this film is stifling and claustrophobic overly confined to interactions between kiki and alexandra it was still engaging and moving to watch so i 'll give it a 7
i'm not much of an expert on acting or other movie details but this movie just hit me deep
i do n't think i 'll ever forget it
one scene especially is imprinted on my brainbr br i also watched the similar movie lilja 4ever
it was also very moving but not quite as straight to the point and brutal
if you are sensitive at all either will bring tears to your eyes but anjos do sol may stay with you foreverbr br this is very depressing subject matter but i think no i hope that the film succeeds in bringing more attention to itbr br more people need to see this film
in northeastern of brazil the father of the twelve years old illiterate maria sells his daughter to the middle man of a prostitution organization tadeu to be employed as a housemaid and have a better life
however the girl is resold to the farmer loureno that deflowers her and he gives the abused girl to his teenager son to have his first sexual experience
then she is sent to a brothel in a gold field in amazonas and explored his owner the despicable saraiva
when maria escapes to rio de janeiro expecting a better life she is explored by the cften vera br br anjos do sol exposes the sad and shameful reality of child prostitution in brazil through the fate of the girl maria
last year i saw lilja 4ever that tells an identical story in the former soviet union therefore this problem does exist in third world countries
director and writer rudi lagemann presents a great movie exposing the reality but never showing nudity or explicit sexual scenes
it is the debut of the promising fernanda carvalho who has an excellent performance in the role of a scared child fighting for survival
most of the prostitutes are amateurs and it is impossible to recognize the famous darlene glria so different she is after many plastic surgeries
the bitter and hopeless end of the story is also very realistic
my vote is tenbr br title anjos do sol
i think the weighted average for this film is too low
i give it a 7 very entertaining although over the top in a few places
my wife says it passes the danielle steele test
superb performances throughout particularly by andie macdowell
crush examines female friendship for the most part avoiding the saccharine quality which spoils so many films with the same theme
at the same time it reveals the power of a sudden passion to overwhelm and surprise
the events depicted were highly improbable but the underlying emotional truth seemed very genuine to me
not a film for the speedingvehicleandexplosion crowd but grownup women are certain to respond with both laughter and tears
this is a very moving picture about 3 fortysomething best friends in a small england town
one finds a passionate loves and a new beginning with a younger piano instructor when tragedy strikes and hearts are changed forever
definitely a film to have a box of tissues with you
a powerful piece of work
this is definitely one of my favorite films of all timebr br spoiler

her two jealous friends play an immature prank which quickly leads to tragedy
she loses her love and her friends in one foul swoop
in the end a unexpected surprise pulls them back together
the first word which comes into my mind after watching this movie is beauty
beauty is all around in actors' play in well designed shots and in authors' red line idea the lovebr br i think the kenny 's character is the only white spot in these three womens' otherwise boring and predictable life
his interaction makes andie 's character living as entertaining as it could possibly be
when he 's gone it became obvious that we cannot really appreciate and hold to our inner believes and sacred desiresbr br the fact that andie successfully recovers from this loss is nothing bad instead it shows that life prevails in any forms even in this small british village which is shown perfectlybr br another reason i love this movie is that it is so british in all ways all that houses and fags and accents
and andie again is doing superb job
it is a shame that this movie got such low marks
10 out of ten
well i thoroughly enjoyed this movie
it was funny and sad and yes the guy andie macdowell shagged was hot
interesting realistic characters and plots as well as beautiful scenery
i think my mum would like it
i still think they should have been allowed to call it the sad fkers club though
me being of irish origins loved this movie not only was the guy hot and funny he was also sincere and honest
i loved the girl who he fell in love with too she was pretty
they were such a cute couple
the ending was so sad
love this movie
although it is a little dirty it reminds of a british or irish version of prime
if you liked this movie you should watch prime
same story line young guy falls for older women older women falls for young guy to
a lot of paths cross in the end the best decision is made or task is completed
do n't have anything else to say without ruining the whole movie all though i thought the french guy was ugly less appealing to me
umm if you like irish movies i would recommend circle of friends that movie is so good
quick quote you might not get unless you watch it well thats my dinner ruined
lol
andie macdowell 's facial expressions are great again in this movie
when you enter 40 and have been single for a while you may feel you are wasting away
the movie is a sweet reminder that love can be found just anywhere if your antennae is acutely active
i liked the quick sexual encounter which must be out of character for a normally reserved school teacher
her exstudent is cute enough still carrying a crush on his teacher for so long
br br there are some parts that i thought rather unrealistic or unpractical though
for example at a scene where the other women 's jealousy override and a scene was set up to make andie macdowell dump the young man would a mature police officer allow her friend to do such a sinister act
is it so easy for anyone to not stop in front of a car
of course accidents happen all the time but i hoped to see the heroine get happily married with the first man she got involved with br br maybe the movie producers are aware of the fact that many romance between an older woman and a younger man do not last for long
beside they know that a happy ending would not appeal to the public especially to jealousy women over 40 who are waiting some miracles to happen
the sad ending with a glimpse of hope for the sad woman who lost her true love is sweet but if the man continued to live would that last
for how long
nobody knows
nonetheless it 's a movie to make you want to watch it again sometime later a year later maybe
i thought this was one of those really great films to see with a bunch of close friends
i laughed and cried and laughed and cried at the same time
it was just really touching
although not a new concept this was a very well made film
ok i admit
i think kenny doughty looks amazing in this movie but beyond his good looks the movie is carried by a sometimes predictable but reasonable plotbr br starting out we 're introduced to the three lead females of the movie
one a headmistress very concerned about her image and never married
a police officer with child and a bad ex to go on about
the third a power status hungry doctor with a desire for recognition and three ex 'sbr br they are almost the first wives club and indeed there is much verbal bashing of ex 's involved as well as some he left the credit card behaviour
characters set the movie continuesbr br mcdowell 's character the headmistress arrives late at a funeral where a young organist filling in for the regular player catches her eye
what will her two friends say about the ensuing mischief
will they live happily ever afterbr br a tissue or two recommended if you 're the teary type the end uplifting but maybe not what you 'd expect
all in all a great movie which stands out amongst the current choices of action special effects and schlock horror
crush provides a combination of drama humor and such irony that i find the english establish very well when it concerns matters of the heart
mostly known for directing john mckay wrote this wonderful screenplay about three fortysomething friends in a small town in england
all three professional women downout of luck with men formed a ritual ladies night gathering with gin fags and sweets intake included with endless chatter of their dates erroneous behavior or the needs of their libidos
andie macdowell once again thrown by the surrounds of the british is absolutely charming as the head mistress of a prestigious school who becomes involved with a younger man
small town gossip and the disapproving jealous friends conflicts with her relationship
unfolding a series of brutal unfortunate events and showing us the many difficulties when one is in pursuit of true happiness
keep in mind the main premise of this film is friendships and the ending shows us exactly that
this is the type of film you either love or hate which is why i believe a lot of mix reviews and not that greatest success resulted when this film was released
as i'm sure most are just unearthing the film now
i very much enjoyed this film and highly recommend for those in the likes of such films as love actually and three weddings and a funeral
not to mention the soundtrack is extraordinary perfectly capturing those crucial moments
kenny doughty as jed willis is sexier in this role than any male porn star even though he keeps his pants onbr br the movie tore at my heart reminding me of the intensity of the big explosive love of my life
i do n't think i can think of another movie except perhaps zeffirelli 's romeo and juliet that captures that giddy joy that wellbr br the other draw of the movie is the very english eccentric characters enjoying the scandal vicariously
in that sense it is much the same appeal as midsomer murder or a miss marple mystery without the mayhembr br this is a great antidote to the mock horror currently popular in the usa an any relationships between people of different ages
having no knowledge of this film prior to seeing it on rialto channel i found it to be a pleasant poignant and enriching film
br br the casting was excellent
i loved all the characters they were a little exaggerated in places
the way it looked and the enjoyably giddy ride the main character took until it turned badly as real life can and does
yes i thought andy macdowell was great
i was particularly interested to watch this film once it began because people so often joke about her acting abilities br br i loved the bit at the end where andy 's character said sometimes i feel he was never here etc it was so completely how it really is in a situation like that then there was that gorgeous classical piece nocturne i think by chopin which was a beautiful way to end br br i say well done to the film makers i have seen 1000s of worse films
this is a refreshing enjoyable movie
if you enjoyed four weddings and a funeral peter 's friends etc you will see a number of familiar and talented actors
made me laugh made me sad
i view movies for entertainment and englishset movies generally fit that bill for me
enjoy
i really truly enjoyed this movie
i am not saying that it is a cinematic masterpiece but it was a great way to spend a cold snowy saturday night
it is funny poignant and a great tales of the ups and downs of female friendships lasting through difficult times and the bad things that female friends tend to do to each others
bill paterson shines as the reverand gerald marsden and andie mcdowell proves that she can be a fine actress when the role is right and she puts her mind to it
you will laugh and you will cry ignore any marketing campaigns and how this film is being marketing it is a hidden gem that should have done tonnes of box office
i was very surprised how much i enjoyed this film
i thought it was funny sexy painful and warm
andie macdowell 's performance was nuanced and vulnerable
for once the director of a macdowell film did not make her beauty another character in the film
the romance between kate and her young man is lovely to watch and it plays out very well
her relationship with her friends is both a thorn and a balm in her life
imelda stalinson who has been a mvp in so many british films does a great job in this
there is some tragedy in this but i think the film is saved in the end by the brilliant acting clean direction and witty writingthe film quality is excellent and the music is good too though unavailable on sound track
too bad a couple of comments before me do n't know the facts of this case
it is based on actual events a highly publicized disappearance and murder case taking place in the wilmington dephiladelphia pa region from '96 through 2000 i have to admit i was highly skeptical of how hollywood would dramatize the actual history and events and was actually quite impressed on how close they stayed to what was constantly reported on local newscasts and philadelphia inquirer news stories throughout the time period
of course i immediately pointed out that the actress who played fahey looked nothing like her
i have to admit though that mark harmon really nailed the type of personality that was revealed as capano 's and the behavior that capano exhibited throughout this period
details of the case were right on no deviations of dramatic effect even down to the carpet gun furniture and cooler
in conclusion i also wanted to add that i have met tom carper many times at various functions and i am so glad that he pulled the strings in the federal realm necessary to solve this heinous crime
guys like capano are real and it was great to see him finally put behind bars
thomas capano was not anne marie 's boss tom carper the governor was
that is the reason the feds became involved he called clinton and asked him to get the feds involved in the case
i lived outside of philadelphia at the time so the case was front page news every day
i also read ann rule 's book and saw the city confidential segment on ae
tom capano was a megalomanic an ubercontroller and a monster
he claimed to love ann marie but all he wanted was someone that he could control
when she would n't let him do that anymore he killed her the ultimate form of control
i think it 's a waste of money that he is still alive
to those who have not followed the anne marie fahey murder case
you are missing out one of the saddest yet complicated murder of all
the murderer is popular delaware attorney tom capano and the victim is the delaware governor 's scheduling secretary anne marie fahey
their relationship was a wellkept secret until her disappearance and murder
she wanted to leave him but he just would n't let her go so easily
on the other hand he had a mistress and a wife and four daughters
where did he find the time to have two mistresses and a domestic family life
besides the case is extremely complicated and fascinating for a four hour mini series
while the actress who plays ms fahey does a fine job she does not have her dark long hair
his other mistress is definitely more attractive than the actual woman
mark harmon is better looking and does an emmy award winning performance as tom capano
it would be better with actual delaware and philadelphia locations
with ann rule 's executive producing she adds accuracy to anne marie 's characteristic of organization and her personal battle with an eating disorder
these bits of information might be overlooked by any other executive producer or director
if you have not read the book it is well worth it
ann rule is a fascinating storyteller of true crime
it is ironic that mark harmon plays tom capano
he also played ann rule 's former friend and subject ted bundy in an another book adaptation many years ago
he was brilliant then and now
he does an above average job with an amazing story
even president clinton offered his assistance in the anne marie fahey case
and now the former governor tom carper is now the united states senator for delaware who defeated longtime popular incumbent senator richard roth in the november 2000 election
if you do n't think the movie is interesting then the read rule 's book
this excellent drama had me in suspense the whole time
i could not take my eyes off the screen for one second because every word kept connecting the pieces to this puzzling murder
this movie really touched me because it showed how sad and hard life can be
i really did cry in the end it also let me realize how cruel and sickening people can be when it comes to murder
br br the cast was also very good
the only bad cast member was the actress who played anne marie
the actress did a great job but the director did n't
i say this because he found someone who did n't look a single bit like anne marie fahey herself
he is the quintessential narcissist and manipulator in this case portraying attorney tom capanobr br kathryn morris is sympathetic as victim anne marie fahey but in the beginning is a bit too much the victim
we are sorry for the situation but become simultaneously disgusted after seeing his victimization of several other women as wellbr br the sad part is where she is actually getting help with her selfesteem issues and capano actually had her psychologist killed
pretty hard to believe but this was based on a true storybr br there is a cameo with olympia dukakis as capano 's mother
all in all an interesting story because it is based on a true murder and you will want to read ann rule 's book to get the accurate details

i could n't have been more thrilled just eight years old back in 1983 i was going to see a star wars movie at the theater
the best day of my life was about to happen
to that time my only star wars experience had been a few hbo showings of star wars
i had n't even seen the empire strikes back yetbr br and boy did that day deliver for my less critical eyes
jabba
big rebel spaceships
the emporer
a greenbladed lightsaber
wow
since that magical day i must have watched this movie hundreds of times
i ca n't even form an accurate estimate at this point
with those multiple viewings i have of course observed that this movie the real episode iii does have its flawsbr br of course in the context of a star wars movie those flaws are more like quirksbr br millions had had their magical day in 1977 and 1980 in may of 1983 i had mine
and this was my star wars movie
i suppose jedi is now chronologically to be considered the very last entry in the popular saga and it 's a very good one as were several of these
i liked how directly this sequel took off after the empire strikes back and i appreciated the maturity of luke skywalker as a character
after hearing so many negative things about the ewoks they were n't so bad
i enjoyed the thrilling chase within the woods and i felt there was a lot of wellrealized emotion with this chapter
the ending successfully weaves all 6 chapters into a wonderful tale of fantasy
i know many true star wars fans hated george lucas for changes he made to the original films but being a relative novice to these movies rather late in life and not missing what i did n't already know i think he made these 6 movies work perfectly as a whole entity
oh and err carrie fisher looked quite delicious in her skimpy outfit
i know i know it was a good ending but sincerely it was awesome
i love when a movie ends on a terrific dark nature but this time i was impressed with darth vader turning against the emperor i really stayed astonished
the anguishing sequence in that film was when luke is tortured and defeated by the emperordarth sidious
he is about to be destroyed when darth vader dark lord of the sith eliminates his dark master
a nice sacrifice
the cinematography of this film is impressive
i was surprised with all the vessels of the rebel battle ships and all imperial war ships and super star destroyers
i loved the new race they brought on screen the mon calomari the ewoks the sullesteian and many more most of my favorite scenes are in that film1when vader destroys the emperor and is fatally wounded
2 when luke sees the spirits of obiwan and yoda and then it shows up anakin skywalker 3 when leia slays jabba strangling the hutt crime lordbr br i personally like the script and the battle of endor presenting a ground and space combat as well the best duel of star wars between darth vader vs luke skywalker on the death star
postscript the scenes with leia in the slave bikini are memorable
910
as most off you might off seen star wars return off the jedi you may knows its a good movie but as you might have seen on video they mmight have a party at the end and they just probably end the movie with the party with no a spirits or anything but on the original one when they are partying but before i say more when ben obiwan dies in the imperial ship or death star they saw him disappear and yoda dies from either old age or internal illness but because luke killed darth vader when they all are partying at the end when luke or someone stops the spirits off ben and yoda stands starring at him and smiling while another spirit appears is its darth vader but not as a sith as the old usual selve off him and started smiling with ben and yoda i reckon that made the movie ending a little bit interesting but the producers or anyone should off made a spirit off padme and mace windu and other jedis that got killed with younglings under there arms in the back ground
no there is another br br because every star wars fan had to have an opinion about i ii iii and because that opinion was biased since we missed so much the atmosphere and the characters of the original trilogy i will state the good points of the return of the jedi and a few corresponding bad points of the prequel
of course i loved the music the special effects the two droids but this has been overly debated elsewherebr br what we get in the original trilogy and in this particular movie a strong ecological concern antimilitarist positions fascinating insights about the jedi order and the force cute creatures harrison ford 's smile a killer scene near the ending when vader looks alternatively at his son and at the emperor
the lightning of the lethal bolts reflected on his black helmet
and when he grabs and betrays his master to save luke thereby risking his own life
oh boy br br what is wrong in the prequel inmho the whole human factor element that the original cast was able to push forward is somehow missing the force seems to be more about superpowers and somersaults than about wisdom too many jedis at once and too many light sabers on the screen the lack of experience of a few actors too often threatens the coherence of the plot br br by the way if you enjoy the theory of the force as explained by obi web and yoda then you should read a few books about buddhism and the forms it took in ancient japanbr br the magic of star wars imho lies mainly in the continuing spiritual heritage from a master to his apprentice from a father to his son albeit the difficulties
de mon me ton me as would write bejard to the late zen master t deshimaru
return of the jedi is often remembered for what it did wrong rather than what it did right and that is a shame because the last chronological installment in the star wars saga is a shining example of epic storytelling
it manages to wrap up all story lines of the previous movies in one grand finale and does so very convincinglybr br yes there are ewoks cute and cuddly bears that arguably served to broaden the star wars demographic and in the middle the movie tends to slow down a bit
but the final hour is arguably the best piece of the entire saga where luke finally comes face to face with darth vader the most recognizable villain in movie historybr br return of the jedi did so many things right that people tend to overlook it presented an incredible conclusion to the darth vader storyline an exciting opening at jabba 's palace a masterful performance of ian mcdiarmid as the emperor luke finally coming into his own the resolution of solo and leia 's romance and the extremely powerful final moments on the endor moonbr br yes there are slight annoyances
but they are the annoyances of a generation of moviegoers who 've had time to nitpick every single scene
it 's still a magical and moving piece of cinema that also serves as a great final chapter
it 's not a 'good' movie it 's fantastic
star wars episode 4 br br the best star wars ever
its the first movie i ever sean were the bad guys win and its a very good ending
it really had me wait hing for the next star wars because so match stuff comes along in this movie that you just got to find out more in the last one
whit al lot of movies i always get the feeling that it could be don bedder but not whit this one
and i will never ever forget the part were wader tels luke he is his fatherway too cool
also love the bob feat figure a do hes a back ground player
if you never ever saw a star wars movie you go to she this oneits the bestbr br thanks lucas
dear readersbr br the final battle between the rebellion and empire
the second death star is nearing completion and when it is completed it will spell doom for the rebel alliance
luke skywalker now a jedi knight returns from tatooine with han solo and princess leia now revealed as luke 's twin sister
they agree to lead the attack on the shield generator on the forest moon of endor while lando calrissian leads the attack on the death star
little do they know that a most ingenious trap has been laid for them and the emperor palpatine himself is personally overseeing the construction of the second death starbr br return of the jedi is my favorite of the original trilogy
it 's got action drama romance great battles fantastic acting amazing fight scenes and awesome music by john williams
mark hamill is fully matured now into a jedi knight gone is the naive farmboy and in his place is a calm relaxed jedi determined to save the galaxy
leia is still cool in this film as well as han and lando
3p0 r2 and chewie do their roles to a t while james earl jones still is cinema 's greatest villain darth vader
ian mcdiarmid is also an excellent villain as the twisted and brutally ruthless emperor palpatine
the action sequences of this movie are breathtakingly amazing and the sword fights are serious and gritty
john williams 's score is still cool and enhances the film by several levelsbr br signed the constant dvd collector
i only wish that return of the jedi have been directed by somebody else i mean there is far too much ewoks scenes completely unnecessary
besides this time our heroes look like different people princess leia no longer fights with solo luke looks boring darth vader is not as evil as before and yoda just diesbr br but there are many extraordinary things going on this episode that i just ca n't hate itbr br some spoilers 1 jabba the hut 2 the sail barge attack sequence
3the emperor 4 the speeders chase at the endor forest
5the last battle
6the dark side seduction scene
7the return of anakin to the good side of the force
8 and the last celebrationbr br some of those are so good that they can bring tears to your eyes
if some scenes would have been cut and another director was hired this would have been as perfect as episode 4 and 5 but still is extraordinary
9 out of 10
a very good movie
a classic scifi film with humor action and everything
this movie offers a greater number of aliens
we see the rebel alliance leaders and much of the imperial forces
the emperor is somewhat an original character
i liked the ewoks representing somehow the indigenous savages and the vietnamese
i loved the duel between vader and luke which is the best of the saga
in return of the jedi the epilogue of the first trilogy is over and the empire finally falls
i also appreciated the victory celebration where it fulfills vader 's redemption and returns hi into anakin skywalker spirit along with yoda and obiwan
it gives a sadness and a tear
the greatest scenes in star wars are among this movie when vader turns on the emperor
luke watches and finds comfort in seeing obiwan yoda and his father
the next best scene is when luke rushes to strike back darth vader to protect leia
there is a deep dark side of this film despite there is a good ending
i felt there was much more than meets the eye
and as always the john william 's music will bring the classicism into star wars universe
this is probably the best of all of the star wars movies
br br the starting point of the movie was almost like episode ivspacey cabaret music and thoughts of a cabaret place where the seriousness of mobster jabba the hutt was getting even more serious
he ordered luke to die in a basement pit by the bonecrushing teeth of bantha who looked almost like a cross between a bear and a shark
luke 's jedi powers eventually finish the monster off
adding to the sneaky rescue of han solo who was frozen alive at the end of episode v jabba was very angry about this that luke was sentenced to die at the sarlacc pit outsidebr br but all of the star wars good guys especially r2d2 had other ideas and those other ideas fended off luke 's execution in the end most of jabba 's soldiers died and princess leia was able to use the force to fatally choke jabba to deathbr br like in episode iv the death star in episode vi makes its appearance
as i analyzed the rebel fleet attacking the imperial fighters around the death star the star destroyer personnel i guessed sped up the arming of the main laser using the imperial fighters as a diversion
the 2025 star destroyers that lined up were ready to attack but was called off and instead the laser weapon on the death star was fired in surprise
once it fired the rebel fleet 's only hope was that the death star 's deflector shield was going to be knocked out and this affected lando so much because he wanted to destroy the death star but he could n't until the shield was taken out
and it was taken out with lando 's increasing impatiencebr br like in episode v the imperial walkers make their menacing appearance with their twin cannons killing at least one of the ewoks but the ewoks found ancient yet unusual way to deal with them
for instance chewbacca as well as another ewok was able to commandeer one of the walkers and the other ewoks used logs to knock out two other walkersbr br it is amazing what luke could do with his jedi powers on his light sabre like for instance the scene on endor where luke deflects incoming laser shots from a storm trooper speeder bike and using the sabre to knock out part of the bike
or in a climax using the sabre to break off his own father 's arm during the final sabre fight with sith vaderbr br you probably know the ewoks celebration after the death star was blown complete with a short display of fireworks drumming on the spoils of victory and luke finally meeting up with leia after luke 's own nemesisdarth vader now dead is burned on a pyre
the celebration include ewoks singing but i think lucas did not buy thateven with the strong respect of film composer john williamsbr br on the home movie version i think lucas himself wanted a different ending
in addition to the celebration on endor he wanted shots of celebratory scenes on the several surviving rebel planets including a celebratory laser shot that destroys the statue of the sith
the ewoks song was replaced by an alternative instrumental piece
he probably wanted the extra stuff to prove that with the death star 's destruction balance had been restored to the rebel galaxies
when i think of return of the jedi i think epic
yeah ewoks were in there so what
they 're an interesting add to the movie
jedi is definitely more darker then the rest of the movies
emperor palpatine was one the best parts of the movie
palpatine is so evil and vicious vader looks like mr rogers compared to him
speaking of darth vader what an amazing end to such an iconic character
vader is truly a modern day greek tragedy and i think people can now especially understand and appreciate this after revenge of the sith came out
his redemption at the end was moving and really brings a happy yet bittersweet feeling to you
the best part was of course the special effects
it 's amazing how a film from the early eighties can still stand the test of time with it 's graphics
the scenes at jabba 's palace and of course the epic three way battle at the end are still stunning to look at
in all jedi 's deep plot and emotional moments and incredible special effects is a fitting end to one of the most beloved franchises in cinema history
i was but a babe in arms when george lucas was wowing the world with his out of this world saga chronicling the adventures of young luke skywalker and the notorious darth vadar but even today 20 years on i can appreciate the genius that is lucas and the incredible imagination he 's been blessed with
in a new hope lucas showed a new way to tell stories as he introduced us to such memorable characters as the plucky princess leia the rougish han solo and the spirited luke skywalker as well as that best loved of villains the sinister darth vadar
in the empire strikes back he went all out to show us special effects can add to a tale and managed to something noone thought you could do on screen
he made a film with no specific end or beginning and it went down a treat
return of the jedi is a fitting end to a saga that will stand the test of timebr br when the empire srtikes back ended with encasing of the lovable rouge han solo in carbonite to be delivered to jabba the hut and young luke reeling from the discovery of a terrible truth about his father we were left with the feeling that things were going from bad to worse
vadar it seemed had won the day
how we asked could the rebels ever recover from this blow
in lucas stunning and captivating final chapter we are kept on the edges of our seats from han 's daring rescue from jabba 's palace to the the final climactic battle on the death star between luke and vadar as luke struggles between fulfilling his duties as a jedi and rebel fighter and attempting to reawaken the good he believes is still in his father 's soulbr br old friends like the smooth talking lando calrissian and the ever lovable chewbacca reunite for one final battle to end all battles as a new darker more dangerous enemy emerges in the form of the emperor himself desperate to turn luke to the dark side even if it means betraying his apprentice darth vadarall in black with his red eyesghostly white disfigured face and sinister laugh he truly is a terrifying addition to the story and is the undisputed master of the events that unfold
his new and improved death star spells disaster for the rebels but the brave group launch one last desperate attack to end the empire 's reign for good
br br lucas managed to incorporate three different stories at once and keep the action going so that the audience is riveted
we watch in excitement as han and leia attempt to bring down the shield around the death star from the forest moon of endor with the help of some adorable ewoks and hindered by legions of stormtroopers and imperial officers
we cheer on lando and the other pilots as they take on the mighty imperial fleet and risk life and limb to fly into the deatn star to destroy it once and for all
and we watch with bated breath as vadar and the emperor attempt to turn luke to the dark side while he in turn tries to turn his father backbr br but for me the most difficult and yet compelling battles is that going on inside darth vadar
for rotj is a battle of emotions and feelings
vadar is caught between his loyalty to the emporer and the empire and his fatherly inclinations to luke
never did i think that a mask could show emotion but somehow one ca n't but see the confusion and pain on vadar 's face during the final scenes as the emporer turns on luke
there is more depth and emotion to vadar than i believed a villain especially one more machine then man could have and that i think is what makes him so accessible
he is conflicted
the apprentice as much as the master
the victim as much as the villain
without ruining the end too much vadar 's final scene is the most poignant and wonderful in the trilogybr br so in conclusion what can i say
george lucas is the master of the saga
star wars is the most compelling and engaging sagas i 've seen in a long time and i have yet to see another saga rival it
return of the jedi has all the ingredients necessary to provide the ending lucas masterpiece deserves
it 's action suspense romance tragedy redemption joy all rolled into one and it 's memorable characters wonderful special effects and catchy music make both a great movie in its own right and an ending that lucas can be proud of
after ''empire strikes back'' ' 'return of the jedi'' is my second favorite movie from the star wars seriesbr br luke went to tattoine to save han solo from jabba
at the same time the galactic empire is doing in secret the construction of a new space station like the previous death star
if this station stays totally constructed it will be the end of the rebel alliance
both vader and the emperor are impatient because of the delay of the new death starand they need to kill many of their commanders to have the project made in schedulebr br r2 and c3po are inside jabba 's palace to send a message from luke to jabbawhere lukes pretends to negotiate han 's life
he gives r2 and c3po as a gift to jabba as part of his plan
jabba does not accept the negotiationsince he is using han solo as a piece of his palace 's decoration
lando is hidden as jabba 's guard and chewbacca is also gave to jabba by a reward hunter
when the same hunter tries to save han solo and makes him stay in human form again we see that is actually princess leia in a disguise
the problem is that jabba discovers leia 's plan and takes her as his slavewhile han is thrown away in chewbacca 's cellbr br luke comes as a jedi knight to rescue his friends
at his first try to kill jabbahe falls into jabba 's monster cell but easily kills it
jabba stays angry and decides to thrown hanchewbacca and luke to sarlacc a big creature from the desert who stays 1000 years digesting it 's 'food'
lukehan and chewie has success in scape again and even boba fett dies when han accidentally throws him in to sarlacc 's mouth
leia kills jabba and goes after hanluke and chewie as well c3po and r2
br br everybody 's safe againluke decides to go to dagoba to complete his training as a jedias well his promise to yoda
the problem is that yoda is too old and sick since he already has 900 years old and before he dies yoda says to luke that he does not need more trainingbut to really be a jedi he must fight with vader again
he confirms to luke that vader is luke 's dad and that there is another skywalker besides luke
in his last moments yoda asks to luke to remember his advices about the temptation of the dark side and to luke transmit his jedi knowledge to other people
when yoda diesobi wan 's spirit shows up to luke and tells him that luke 's father killed his good side anakin to become darth vader and also that he is more machine than a man since he became a sith
luke stays worried about killing his own dad and says that he feels that his father still has kindness
obi wan tells luke that his twin sister is leia and says the reasons why luke and leia were separated since babies
he gives his last advice to luke saying that if he refuses to kill vader the emperor will win the warbr br at the same time the emperor says to vader that he must give luke to him when he shows up since luke is stronger than before and they both needs to combine their efforts to bring luke to the dark sidebr br now we are going to have one of the best battles from the star war serieswhen the rebel alliance plans to attack the new space station the '' death star 2'' luke will confront vader and the emperor and leia han and chewie needs to turn off the 'death star 2' power field with the help of the ewoks
br br this is for sure one of the most exciting star wars of all
thanks to kevin smith a bunch of geeks are running around saying that return of the jedi is n't any good because it 's actually fun to watch
and oh no
muppets are involved
that makes it bad
everyone liked return of the jedi until someone in a kevin smith movie made a negative comment about it
now all of a sudden people people look at you like you have some kind of disease if you mention how much you like it
this movie is so much better than anything kevin smith ever even considered creating that it boggles my mind that the man would even think of denouncing it
this movie is good fun
it 's just as awesome as i remember it being when i was six
enjoy this movie for what it is and stop stealing kevin smith 's opinions
his are n't correctbr br and that ewok song at the end ruled
i bet you people do n't even enjoy ewoks battle for endor
i'm going to set you all on fire
this film is to my mind the weakest film in the original star wars trilogy for a variety of reasons
however it emerges at the end of the day a winner despite all its flaws
it 's still a very good film even if a lot of its quality depends on the characters that have been built up in the superior 2 installmentsbr br one problem here is the look of the film which is n't very consistent with the other 2 films
i put a lot of that down to the departure of producer gary kurtz
the first 2 films have that dirty livedin look with all the technology and so forth
in jedi on the other hand even the rebels look like they just stepped out of a shower and had their uniforms dry cleaned
this makes for a much less textured film
also the creatures were excessively muppetlike and cutesy
at this point it seems like the filmmakers were more concerned with creating the templates for future action figures than with the quality of the film itselfbr br another aspect is its lack of originality
where star wars created a whole new experience in cinema and empire brought us to alien worlds of swamps ice and clouds jedi lamely recycled the locations of the first film
first we are back on the desert planet tatooine and then we are watching them face another death star
also we have these ewoks who really are just detestable madeformattel teddy bears in a recycled version of what was supposed to be the big wookiefight at the end of star wars if they had n't run out of cash
it just feels like lazy constructionbr br the most unfortunate aspect of jedi for me is the weak handling of the han solo character
whereas he is central to the plot of the first 2 films here he is struggling for screen time trading one liners with the droids
instead of a real drama we 're stuck with the lame pretense that han is still convinced leia loves luke as if the conclusion of empire where she confessed her love of him had never happened
the whole thing is very contrived and barely conceals the fact that the solo character was not part of this film 's central story after his rescue
ford for his part looks bored and lacks the style that distinguished his earlier performances
this is more like a 1990s ford performance bored and looking above the film itself
fisher for her part is visibly high in some scenes
lando an interesting character introduced in empire here is stuck as the ostensible person we care about in the giant space battle
only hamill given an interesting development in the luke character is really able to do anything new or interesting with his character
probably he was the only major actor in the film who still cared about his work
and to be fair the script gives him a lot more to do than the other characters
really it is his story and the other characters are only there as part of the package
ian mcdiarmid does excellent work as well as the emperor
the film would sink if he had been too far over the top br br visually and in terms of effects work other than the clean look of everything it 's hard to find fault
jabba is a very effective animatronic character one of the most elaborate ever constructed
the space battles towards the end are very impressivebr br ultimately this film coasts to success based on the accomplishments of its forebears
but on its own it is a satisfying piece of entertainment and imho far superior to any of lucas' later productions
first i 'd like to say that while i know my share about star wars i am not a fanatic
i do not know how many chromosomes a wamp rat has or the extended family of tk427
what i know is this star wars all the movies captured something magical
it 's hard to say what what button lucas has found and boldly pressed but it works
star wars is more than a movie
it 's an ideabr br how may you ask
i shall explain
star wars touches on the most universal of stereotypes good vs evil
it does this so obviously so profoundly that literally any person from any environment can understand
episode vi does the very well concluding the epic struggle between a son and his used and manipulated father yet also with the addition of the prequels reveals even more to the hinted back story
suddenly it 's darth vader at the front and viewers realize that it 's the story about anakin not just luke
but even before 13 there was amazing depth to it all
it felt real as if capsule fell from the sky into lucas 's lap detailing a historical account of a galaxy far far awaybr br star wars is definitely something far above the norm and i must admit whenever i see them particularly this one i feel very small
i feel as though i 've been thrust into a world where good and evil are so clearly defined
i get a tingling feeling when i see them a feeling that something somehow has touched me more than any physical thing could ever hope
i thought that rotj was clearly the best out of the three star wars movies
i find it surprising that rotj is considered the weakest installment in the trilogy by many who have voted
to me it seemed like rotj was the best because it had the most profound plot the most suspense surprises most emotional and definitely the most episodic movie
i personally like the empire strikes back a lot also but i think it is slightly less good than than rotj since it was slowermoving was not as episodic and i just did not feel as much suspense or emotion as i did with the third moviebr br it also seems like to me that after reading these surprising reviews that the reasons people cited for rotj being an inferior film to the other two are just plain ludicrous and are insignificant reasons compared to the sheer excellence of the film as a whole
i have heard many strange reasons such as a because yoda died b because bobba fett died c because small ewoks defeated a band of stormtroopers d because darth vader was revealedbr br i would like to debunk each of these reasons because i believe that they miss the point completely
first off who cares if bobba fett died
if george lucas wanted him to die then he wanted him to die
do n't get me wrong i am fan of bobba fett but he made a few cameo appearances and it was not lucas' intention to make him a central character in the films that star wars fans made him out to be
his name was not even mentioned anywhere in the movie you had to go to the credits to find out bobba fett 's name
judging rotj because a minor character died is a bit much i think secondly many fans did not like yoda dying
sure it was a momentous period in the movie
i was not happy to see him die either but it makes the movie more realistic
all the good guys ca n't stay alive in a realistic movie you know
otherwise if all the good guys lived and all the bad guys died this movie would have been tantamount to a cheesy saturday morning cartoon
another aspect to this point about people not liking yoda 's death well nobody complained when darth vader struck down obi wan kenobi in a new hope
why was obi wan 's death okay but yoda 's not hmmmmmmmmmmmm another reason i just can not believe was even stated was because people found cute ewoks overpowering stormtroopers to be impossible
that is utterly ridiculous
i can not believe this one
first off the ewoks are in their native planet endor so they are cognizant of their home terrain since they live there
if you watch the movie carefully many of the tactics the ewoks used in defeating the stormtroopers was through excellent use of their home field advantage
they had swinging vines ropes logs set up to trip those walkers and other traps
the stormtroopers were highly disadvantaged because they were outnumbered and not aware of the advantages of the forest
the only thing they had was their blasters
to add it was not like the ewoks were battling the stormtroopers themselves they were heavily assisted by the band of rebels in that conquest
i thought that if the stormtroopers were to have defeated a combination of the star wars heros the band of rebels as well as the huge clan of ewoks with great familiarity of their home terrain that would have been a great upset
lastly if this scene was still unbelievable to you how about in empire strikes back or in a new hope where there were several scenes of a group consisting of just han solo chewbacca and the princess being shot at by like ten stormtroopers and all their blasters missed while the heros were in full view
and not only that the heroes of course always hit the stormtroopers with their blasters
the troopers must have very very bad aim then
at least in empire strikes back the battle of endor was much more believable since you had two armies pitted each other not 3 heroes against a legion of stormtroopers
do n't believe me
check out the battle at cloud city when our heroes were escaping lando 's base
or when our heros were rescuing princess leia and being shot at as han solo and luke were trying to exit the death starbr br the last reason that i care to discuss is that people did not like darth vader being revealed
well in many ways that was a major part of the plot in the movie
luke was trying to find whether or not darth vader was his father annakin skywalker
it would have been disappointing if the movie had ended without luke getting to see his father 's face because it made it complete
by annakin 's revelation it symbolized the transition darth vader underwent from being possessed by the dark side and to the good person he was annakin skywalker
the point is that annakin died converted to the light side again and that is what the meaning of the helmet removal scene was about
in fact that 's is what i would have done in that scene too if i were luke 's father is n't that what you would have done if you wanted to see your son with your own eyes before you died and not in a mechanized helmetbr br on another note i think a subconscious or conscious expectation among most people is that the sequel must be worse that preceding movies is another reason that rotj does not get as many accolades as it deserves
i never go into a film with that deception in mind i always try to go into a film with the attitude that well it might be better or worse that the original but i can not know for sure let 's see
that way i go with an open mind and do not dupe myself into thinking that a clearly superior film is not as good as it really wasbr br i am not sure who criticizes these movies but i have asked many college students and adults about which is their favorite star wars movie and they all tell me that it is rotj
i believe that the results on these polls are appalling and quite misleadingbr br bottom line the return of the jedi was the best of the trilogy
this movie was the only one of the three that kept me riveted all throughout its 135 minutes
there was not a moment of boredom because each scene was either suspenseful exciting surprising or all of the above
for example the emotional light saber battle between luke and his father in rotj was better than the one in the empire strikes back any day
br br finally i hope people go see the phantom menace with an open mind because if fans start looking for nitpicky insignificant details to trash the movie such as this movie stinks because luke is not in it
then this meritorious film will become another spectacular movie that will be the subject of derision like rotj suffered unfortunatelybr br
return of the jedi is certainly the most action packed of the series and is a fine conclusion to the star wars saga
with han solo imprisoned by jabba the hut and the empire building a new death star the rebel alliance is facing an uphill struggle against the dark side and only our favourite heroes can pull it offbr br the opening sequence set on tatooine we see jabba 's palace a pit of slavery and scum and new home to han solo as luke and the gang prepare for his rescue and with luke 's jedi powers they have the edgebr br we also witness a tremendous triple battle at the end
han leia and chewy battle it out on endor desperate to deactivate the shields protecting the death star
the rebel fleet led by lando battle with the imperial fleet while they wait for the shields to go down and luke has a final showdown with darth vader
an epic end to a classic saga and it 's only just of the pace of the first twobr br 1010
despite the feelings of most star wars fans in my opinion return of the jedi is the greatest cinematic film ever created
ever since the first time i saw it it 's depth intensity special effects and moving story have overwhelmed me
the film was so well put together that it has been able to stand the test of time over the last 20 years
filled with powerful action as the climax of the original trilogy george lucas gives us a rousing finish of the star wars saga in jedibr br film summary br br after the empire strikes back left us hanging for 3 long years we finally find the end of the story in return of the jedi
darth vader in emotional turmoil makes a surprise visit to a new uncompleted death star to oversee it 's construction
the emperor is first seen in this film as he has the ultimate plan to destroy the rebel alliance and bring young luke skywalker to the dark side
luke lando leia chewie and the droids all travel to tatooine to rescue the frozen han solo from the crime lord jabba the hutt
after han has been rescued and jabba defeated luke returns to dagobah to find a dying yoda where he learns the awful truth darth vader is in fact his father
the rebel heroes regroup with the rebel fleet
now joined by other species and races including the mon calamari the rebels must make a allornothing plan of attack to destroy the death star before it is completed
while lando heads the space attack in the millennium falcon the rebel heroes must disable the death star 's shield generator on the forest moon of endor
it is here that the rebels happen upon the furry but mighty ewoks
during the the two part intense battle a third battle must take place as luke willingly delivers himself to vader in an attempt to convince him to leave the dark side
in emotionally charged sequences luke must face his father as the emperor lures out his dark emotions
as young skywalker is about to face his death at the hands of palpatine vader turns on his wicked master to save his son 's life
br br filled with a deep timeless story of good vs evil return of the jedi is a spectacular emotionally charged film that redeems the good in all of us
this final entry in george lucas 's star wars movies is often regarded as the weakest of the lot
however this is not to say that it is a totally worthless entry in the series
on the contrary
sure it 's not as groundbreaking as its predecessors and a bit more slowgoing at times but return of the jedi still offers a lot to warrant the price of admissionbr br the first third of the movie where luke and his friends rescue han from the palace of jabba the hutt is a classic
jabba a truly disgusting blob of bloated flesh who speaks in his own language not only makes a great villain but a memorable one too
it must have been a nightmare to construct this giant puppet much less give it the spark and life that we see on the finished product
actually what also makes this sequence fun is the clever use of puppets for the various members of jabba 's court including the intimidating slavering rancor and scary sarlaac pit monster
it builds masterfully to its climax and pulls punches all the whilebr br things get a little bit slower around the second act where luke discovers that he and leia are related by blood and when we travel to the forest planet of endor home of the cuddlesome yet stalwart ewoks
most of the complaints about return of the jedi that i 've read seem to be centered on these furry creatures in that they somehow disrupt the tone of the saga
i do n't totally agree with that although this moment is probably played out a bit longer than it should
however their leader wicket is a delightfully memorable creation and watching how they handle the imperial troops' technology with their simple natural weapons provides a nice contrastbr br by the time we get to the third act though the pace picks up again as we intercut between the ewoks battle against the troops lando and the rebel forces launching an attack against the empire 's allnew halfcompleted death star and luke 's final showdown with darth vader and the emperor
the latter ties with the jabba palace sequence as the highlight of the movie
mark hamill flexes his acting chops once again as luke skywalker in these scenes and watching him as a fully matured jedi knight makes for an unforgettable performance
also as iconic as james earl jones' voice as darth vader is he is rivaled only by the shriveled cronelike emperor played with deliciously raspy frightening evil by ian mcdiarmid
the tension between this trio heightens the excitement of this climactic moment which is appropriately darkly lit and menacingly underscoredbr br the star wars movies have always set standards for special effects and the technical work in return of the jedi can easily hold a candle to its predecessors
the space battle fights are as exhilarating as always and the speeder bike chase through the forest is a knockout
of course given that this movie was made after a new hope and the empire strikes back it probably should n't be so surprising that the special effects have reached an even greater level of excellence
the acting is classic star wars fare hamill harrison ford and carrie fisher all mature and deepen into their roles and anthony daniels provides more hilarious moments as c3po
frank oz 's yoda only appears in two scenes but he makes the most of it
and yes there 's also john williams' musicbr br all told while return of the jedi falters a little bit in the middle the first and third acts deliver in style making this a rather satisfactory finale to one of the greatest sagas everbr br in 1997 george lucas rereleased the classic star wars in digitally restored special editions which featured addedin effects andor shots as well as some enhancements
of the three return of the jedi appears to have caused the most commotion with star wars fans
perhaps it can be due to the jarringly outofplace jedi rocks musical number in jabba 's palace which although technically amazing does disrupt the flow of the film
however i did like the ending montage scenes where we see victory celebrations occurring on the various planets of the galaxy
this dvd version features yet more tweakingwe get to see more montage finale scenes and in what is probably the most controversial change hayden christensen as the specter of anakin skywalker in the closing scenes
probably due to the intense disdain fans have for his somewhat shaky work in episode ii attack of the clones it seems inevitable that fans would put this edition down for that alone
however if you 're watching the star wars saga chronologically chances are you may react a little differently
nonetheless it is an issue that fans have raised so it 's probably best to be warned beforehandbr br as nice as it would be to have lucas release the original versions of these three classic films he nonetheless stands by what he said about these revamps being the definitive editions of his classic trilogy and when viewing the star wars movies altogether as one complete saga it actually makes sense to keep them technically and aurally consistent
the original films will always be engraved in our memories but these new incarnations are just as much fun if one can give them a chance
after star wars a new hope redefined science fiction and the empire strikes back redefined star wars it 's hard to believe that the third and final film of this trilogy can manage to be as good as the other two but this one really does a nice job
the first part of the film resolves the cliffhanger left by the previous one with an elaborate escape plan that is in keeping with the incredible suspense and action of the first two films
then the film moves back to the rebel alliance and what 's going on in the war
there is a lot of action in the scenes building up to the rebellion 's final confrontation with the emperor
when the battle begins the audience is already on the edge of their seats from everything leading up to it and this final battle is even more intense than those from the other films
this climax is definitely more dense with action than any other part of the trilogy with the most at stake for the rebellion
this is continually changing between a ground battle between the rebel strike crew on land the battle raging on in space and a confrontation between luke and the emperor on the new death star which leads up to another duel with darth vader
it is really intense since the rebels constantly seem to be losing the battle that will determine the outcome of the war and there seems to be no escape
although i think the idea of ewoks overpowering stormtroopers is a bit farfetched it did n't seem very unrealistic since they were more of a distraction that the rebels could use rather than an actual threat to the stormtroopers although they did have some luck fighting them
there is also a twist or two at the end that nobody saw coming which may not be quite as stunning as that of the empire strikes back but still complete a very spectacular trilogy very well
with the light tone of a new hope and the more sinnister tone of the empire strikes back this film really completes them by combining the two in this grand finale
the special edition for return of the jedi concentrated on what would have been nice to change since not much of the original really needed it
fifteen years of technology advancements did n't seem to make up for fifteen years of deterioration as far as the rancor scene is concerned and there still is the occasional disappearing tie fighter but other than that it was good
the gaping nonthreatening sarlaac 's mouth was given moving tentacles and a huge flytrap looking head that emerged which definitely added to the suspense
also the disco was taken out of jabba 's palace and the lame ending of the original was replaced by a huge victory celebration spanning the entire galaxy instead of just a small ewok village which was the case of the original and that did n't really end a story this big the way it deserved
it 's hard to say which of the three films was the best but since it 's all part of the same story the overall trilogy is like one big outstanding film
a third mustsee for film fans
the last film in lucas' saga is a lavish spectacularlooking production
it is often considered the ugly duckling of the original trilogy but i think it is a notch above episode iv
in fact i think it is the third best film in the 6part saga
as far as i'm concerned it is still a grandiosely entertaining film
it is not a movie with a beginning climax and ending the film 's mechanism operates with only one goal in its mind bring closure to lucas' universe
there is an air of finality attached to the whole thing which makes the film a little too sentimental but emotionally rewarding
also it is a lot of fun
new characters are introduced and old ones face new unexpected challenges
c3po and r2d2 provide great comic relief
leia and solo are a wonderful romantic duo and luke is still a great character to identify with
again it is luke 's inner conflict what gives the saga its backbone
lucas' aggressive imagination is still very much apparent and the film 's themes of loyalty hope and redemption resonate strongly
i'm glad lucas eventually dropped the idea of making episode vii viii and ix because this film is a great bookend to a long fascinating and captivating saga
not a perfect movie but fun in the best matine style
up until the sixth and last episode of the star wars saga which finally ended in 2005 i had always looked at this 1983 entry as my favorite film of the longrunning series
the varied action scenes and really different characters made this a particularly appealing moviebr br none of the action ever focused too long in one spot either
the last half hour exemplifies this the most as the scene switches every few minutes from the woods to the battle among space ships to the individual laserduel between luke skywalker and darth vaderbr br another nice characteristic this film had that the two previous did not was the absence of infighting between two of the stars
gone was the incessant bickering between carrie fisher and harrison ford
finally everyone was on the same page
it was nice to seebr br in the end this was simply a wonderful adventure tale more than anything else
when it comes to creating a universe george lucas is the undisputed master and his final star wars film is very very good
having recently seen revenge of the sith really puts this movie in perspective
the final battle seems even more climactic knowing what anakin skywalker went through at the manipulative hands of the emperor
it also makes the final battle between luke and vader more bitter considering the love he felt for padm and the love she felt for her children
actually while the new films are inferior to the original films they are good for one reason only
they make the old films seem even betterbr br mark hamill does an exceptional job in this movie
he really brings the changes luke has gone through seem real
in all fairness i believe that he should have become a big actor based on these films because he really does a great job
harrison ford is still good
however you can feel that he has done raiders and blade runner in between the two final chapters of star wars because he seems to have grown quite a bit
he adds more comedy to the character which works brilliantly
in short han solo is better than ever
carrie fisher was never really a good actress but she does a decent job and is certainly passable
ian mcdiarmid appears in this film and having seen episode iii i can safely say that he is one of the most accomplished villains ever
james earl jones still provides the voice for vader and he is still very very goodbr br in terms of how the movie looks its pretty safe to say that the star wars universe looks better than in either of the previous movies but this was always lucas' fort so that is really to be expected
the final battle over endor is very well made both in terms of the general effects and tension wise
it was also a nice touch that lucas decided to have three battles take place at the same time as it added to the overall tension of the climax
br br the only thing i feel is dragging the movie down from an otherwise deserved 9 are the ewoks
these little creatures are so annoying they almost ruin every scene they are in
besides i find it to be a little to kiddy when a group of teddy bears with bows and arrows can defeat a squadron of storm troopers with laser guns and mighty machinerybr br all in all return of the jedi is a very good movie but the fact that richard marquand is a less accomplished director than irvin kershner does that the overall feel of the movie is less than brilliant
also george lucas' stupid decision to add the ewoks to the universe does that the film falls short of brilliancebr br 810
a long time ago in a galaxy far far away there was a boy who was only two years old when the original star wars film was released
he does n't remember first seeing the movie but he also does n't remember life before it
he does remember the first star wars themed gift he got a shoebox full of action figures from the original set
he was too young to fully appreciate how special that gift would be
but years later he would get what to this day goes down as one of the best gifts he 's ever received another box full of action figures ten of the final twelve he needed to complete his collection
it 's now legendary in this boy 's family how the last action figure he needed anakin skywalker stopped being produced and carried in stores and how this boy went for about ten years trying to track one down and finally bought it from someone on his dorm floor for a bag of beer nuggets br br i ca n't review star wars as a movie
it represents absolutely everything good fun and magical about my childhood
there 's no separating it in my mind from christmases birthdays summers and winters growing up
in the winter my friends and i would build snow forts and pretend we were on hoth
my friends' dad built them a kickass tree house and that served as the ewok village
they also had a huge pine tree whose bottom branches were high enough to create a sort of cave underneath it and this made a great spot to pretend we were in yoda 's home
i am unabashedly dorky when it comes to star wars and i think people either just understand that or they do n't
i do n't get the appeal of lord of the rings or star trek but i understand the rabid flocks of fans that follow them because i am a rabid fan of george lucas 's filmsbr br i feel no need to defend my opinion of these movies as some of the greatest of all time
every time i put them in the dvd player i feel like i'm eight years old again when life was simple and the biggest problem i had was figuring out how i was going to track down a figure of anakin skywalkerbr br grade a
i'm sick of people whining about ewoks
true they 're not the best thing that ever happened to star wars but they did happen so deal with it
besides they are cute and i do n't care if they 're marketable
yubb nubbbr br this movie always leaves me in tears
it 's perfect
the end could not be better
i'm excited for the phantom menace because it will suddenly throw the focus of the whole story from luke to anakin
i love how he is revealed at the end it would be too unresolved any other way
so those of you who are complaining that vader 's helmet was removed take a moment to think about it
it 's very effective
vader the man who hid behind a mask for 20 years is finally revealed as a sicklooking man
he is not entirely machine he 's vulnerablebr br i do n't know how the casting director happened to pick such good actors in a new hope
they all do so well
they are believable characters
hamill does an excellent job with his dramatic character development
fisher does a fine job being a female role model
harrison ford need i say morebr br the music is once again brilliant
it 's so very touching and significant when you can pick out character themes at different parts of the movie
the best climax is when luke shouts nooo
and jumps out to fight his father in the final battle
john williams is nothing short of a genius
what an amazing manbr br already the movie has so much more meaning for me because of episode i i ca n't wait to finally see it in the theatres and then watch the original trilogy yet againbr br bravo
perspective is a good thing
since the release of star wars episode i the phantom menace claims and counterclaims of just how episode 's ii and iii will eventuate has taken the spotlight off the 'original' star wars films making them part of a cohesive whole rather than segregating the older and new films into separate trilogies
what the new films have done is allow fresh perspectives to be placed on the older films
this new outlook allows us to greater appreciate what has often been viewed as the weakest of the original trilogy return of the jedi
often derided for its overly 'cute' factor rotj is in a sense as strong as the original and only slightly less impressive than the nearly perfect the empire strikes back
indeed the 'cute' element of rotj namely the ewoks remains a weak link in the entire series
did george lucas place the furry midgets in the film purely for the merchandising possibilities
only he can answer that questionbr br this cute factor aside the film is a brilliant full circle and evolution of the saga
following on from the conclusion of the empire strikes back luke skywalker follows his rebel alliance friends to tatooine his home planet to rescue han solo the space pirate turned rebel hero who was captured by jabba the hutt for overdue debtsbr br skywalker is a changed man since leaving tatooine with ben 'obi wan' kenobi to fight the evil empire
now swathed all in black luke 's discovery of his origins have left him confused and torn
his psychological make up is not as strong as his outward appearance would suggest
while he might aim to always assist his rebel friends he yearns for another chance to confront the evil darth vader again despite his unassuredness as to whether he will destroy him or eventually turn to the dark side and join vader at the emperor 's sidebr br early scenes in tatooine are impressive from jabba 's lair to his floating palace and the 'almighty sarlac' an intenstine that lives in the sand
lucas' cgi enhancements to the film in 1997 actually worsened the overall effect of the sarlac making it look fake and overdonebr br the battle scene on tatooine is outstanding and is one of the more memorable of the saga
luke almost singlehandedly anihiliates jabba and his cronies proving his prowess as a jedi is now almost completebr br when luke returns to the degobah system to visit the ailing yoda one more time the viewer is let down by yoda 's distinct lack of screentime
undoubtably the star of the empire strikes back yoda is all but erased from the story as the progression of luke 's destiny is played out on screenbr br rotj really is luke 's film perhaps even more so than the original
his journey carries the movie as he moves closer to his confrontation with darth vader and his fate
the other rebel characters certainly work in his shadow
the romance between leia and solo is all but nonexistant unlike in empire
in fact only leia 's character is developed in rotj solo 's character seems to fade as the facets of his personality have become too familiar in the first two filmsbr br their roles are consigned to working alongside the rebels to destroy an all new death star that nears completion
this time the emperor himself is overseeing the final stages of construction
the empire intends to crush the rebellion once and for all while the emperor himself schemes to bring the now powerful skywalker to his side to work alongside darth vader
the emperor is a different kind of evil for this film less cunning than governor tarkin from star wars more deeply psychologically dark than anything else
played brilliantly by ian mcdiarmid the emperor is just one of those characters you love to hatebr br all the other actors are well entrenched in their roles
hamill surprises as the more wisened luke making his character 's progression from whiny teenager impatient student to enlightened warrior one of the few real character developments of the series
ford 's role is waring thin as all his charm and charisma was spent in the first two films he was the real star of the first film after all
fisher 's leia is more of a prop at least unti the end of the film where she learns things about herself that she was never sure about add in favourites like alec guiness as kenobi yoda and the loveable chewbacca c3po and r2d2 and the series resembles a family more than a castbr br despite the film 's corny forest battle involving the ewoks and the empire it ends well and includes a three way battle sequence on endor in space and on the death star each with very impressive special effects
the music as always is brilliant and captures the mood perfectly in every instance
just as the 'blue danube' worked perfectly for 2001 a space odyssey john williams' score is as much a part of star wars folklore as light sabers and the forcebr br lucas left the ending open to interpretation meaning there could have been more episodes made
indeed scifi fans have created their own versions of episodes vii viii and ix in their heads over and over again
rotj works when given a chance and furry cute animals aside is a good finish to the seriesbr br when all six episodes get to be viewed together this saga could well be the best ever made
is it already
the addition of episode i changed the landscape of the series
this is why return of the jedi can now be viewed in a different light and be given a whole new appreciation nearly 20 years after its release
i noticed that a new hope and the empire strikes back are in the top 10 but that this one is n't even in the top 100br br this movie has a bad reputation because of ewoks but there are so many reasons to love this moviebr br the rescue of han solo from jabba this official wraps up the han solo in debt subplot that was established when we first met the character in a new hopebr br the emperor was finally revealled well alright this might not work as well now that the prequels are out but this was the first time we saw the emperor as kidsbr br the speeder bike chase alright so this was a special effects moment
but it was definitely one of the most memorable and exciting moments in all the filmsbr br the 3 part climax 1 the battle of endor 2 luke confronts his father the fall of the emperor 3 the destruction of the second death star br br the final celebration with our heroes like i said this movie gets a lot of crap because of the ewoks but i think it 's kind of cool that while the entire galaxy celebrates the fall of the empire our heroes are having their own private party in the woods with each otherbr br all in all this was a great final chapter for our heroes and a fitting end to the star wars story
i will admit i thought this movie was n't going to be any good but i soon changed my mind
the movie was keep you guessing as which direction it 's going
pierce broson is amazing in his role as a hit man who suddenly becomes burned out asks a man he met at a mexican bar for help
greg kinnear is an awesome straight man as his role as a mild mannered man from denver who starts a innocent conversation with pierce at a mexican bar
the movie will have you laughing as pierce delivers hilarious one liners br br the imaginary in this movie is very well done especially at the bullfight scene when pierce sees himself when trying to finish his last jobs
i did n't have many expectation going into the film but i thought it was fantastic
pierce brosnan is outstanding in a very different role
he has dumped the slick armani suits for a ridiculous look and pays off showing that he is an excellent actor
pierce and greg kinnear play off each other great and make for one of the better buddy pairings in a long time
the humor is dark the performances by brosnan kinnear and hope davis are great mix that with a touching element to the story about friendship and you have a great film
this is probably one of the better buddy comedies in a long time
this is a film that definitely shows that we can expect great things in the postbond era of brosnan 's career
i saw this movie while it was under limited release mainly for the novelty of seeing pierce brosnan with a moustache but it turned out to be one of the funniest movies i have seen all year
it starts out almost as a thriller but steadily progresses into a hilarious piece of work full of oneliners and great comedic energy between pierce brosnan and greg kinnear
also while i say this movie is a comedy it does n't forget it has a heart at times and can be very touching when it needs to be
when i went into the theater i did n't know what to expect much more than a moustache but what i got was one of the best movies i have seen in a long time
leaving the theater i felt very fulfilled from the film and plan to see it again in wide release
i recommend it to anyone who appreciates a good comedy with a wellwritten script and a big moustache
interesting how much more realistic brosnan 's performance is to that of the original james bond novels when compared to the bond films
he 's neurotic paranoid an alcoholic and a womanizer to boot
this is perfect break for him even so much as to make fun of the bond icon
i'm a mess a parody of myself he says
it does n't get any better than that
i just finished reading drno and this is very much how ian fleming had portrayed james bond
personally i never liked brosnan as bond because he fit the icon too closely
there was nothing for him to personalize the character with as compared to roger moore or sean connery
its great to see brosnan play a character both grounded in reality and flamboyantly off the wall
a shallow character trying to come to an understanding on deeper emotional and psychological issues to which he has no background dealing with
it 's an impressive portrayal and having greg kinear to ground him is just poetic
this movie reminds me a little bit of dynamics established between the main characters in my blue heaven but more genuine in their coping mechanisms
first let me say the director has some wonderful use of titles in his establishing shots
i really enjoyed them
i really enjoyed this movie but i got to say next to pierce brosnan greg kinear is pretty lackluster
brosnan melts into this character so well that it is really hard to remember that this is the same guy that played bond
it also shows his range and depth as an actor
it is kinda of an indie flick and was really nice to see especially with all of the mainstream movies that flood the movies at this time of the year
i found the characters to be well crafted
the twist in the middle i felt was especially good
i also liked how the characters come off realistically
so many times we have in film these caricatures of people that are not really characters but walkingstereotypes i like the different approaches this movie takes
i think of sideways when i think of this movie but i think this is more watchable and a better movie overall
dark comedy
gallows humor
how does one make a comedy out of murder
it can be risky business as the viewer is required to let go of their moral values and laugh at the antics of a man who kills people
so the story has be rock solid with a good dash of suspended reality in order to make it work
so pierce brosnan the irishman 's answer to 007 is now cast as a chainsmoking sexaddicted alcoholic who kills people for a living and is having a life crisis
he meets a struggling businessman greg kinnear and after a rocky beginning he learns that he needs a friend
but greg 's happily married to hope davis and brosnan sees in him the basic things he does n't have love home and a life
add character actor philip baker hall as the hitman 's manager and we 're off to the races
brosnan is wonderfully crass and crude as the antihero and kinnear delightful as his counterpart the very human businessman
hope davis adds a sparkle as kinnear 's very conventional wife who is fascinated with this derelict who drifts into their lives
the ending is delightful and with some surprise to it
you should leave the theater feeling at least partly good if you 're able to suspend being aghast at killing people
pierce brosnan the newest but no longer james bond is an assassin
he is very very good at what he does but he 's getting old and tired
greg kinnair is really good as the straight and narrow business man
now when the story opens the movie shows these two people in their separate lives
then one night they are having drinks in a bar and they begin to talk
then all of a sudden you find these two people getting drawn together during a series of events
the story is excellent the acting is top notch and the humor is hilarious i never thought that pierce brosnan would be this funny but he really is and i must say this movie is a must see
this will not likely be voted best comedy of the year a few too many coincidences and plot holes
however we are talking about a movie where a hitman and a white bread salesman become buddies so a few vagaries should n't come as too much of a surprise
brosnan is excellent in this role gone is the wooden james bond
if he can maintain this kind of quality i hope he continues to make comedies
greg kinnear is also excellent as brosnan 's straight man
i 've read a few negative comments in here about hope davis but i thought she was quite good as a mousy housewife with a dark side buried deep within
there are lots of good chuckles as brosnan sleazes his way through and a few scenes where i nearly died laughing
my father nearly lost it when julian describes himself as a facilitator
much like grosse pointe blank another hitman comedy the humour can be very dark
if you are in to that be prepared to enjoy yourself
the matador is a dark comedy starring pierce brosnan as an aging hit man who befriends a straightarrow happilymarried american businessman in mexico
although the sardonic julian appears to be a tough guy on the surface underneath he is really just a mass of neuroses and insecurities a man who realizes that his chosen profession has left him virtually alone in the world and friendless
thus on his birthday he reaches out to danny a man who has lived his life playing by the rules and who becomes strangely intrigued by julian 's unconventional lifestyle
in fact both men find in each other the person they could never be but wish they could become in their quieter franker moments of selfevaluationbr br although the film is a bit too reminiscent of analyze this and midnight run to feel entirely fresh and original the matador nevertheless earns points for the complexity of its characters and the quality of its acting
brosnan looking aged and almost used up sinks his teeth into the role of julian in a way he never has before
playing a man who seems constitutionally unable to make a serious connection with another human being brosnan is flip and cavalier one moment then genuine and sympathetic the next
he always keeps us off balance so that the humor never becomes crass or stale
kinnear is also excellent as the regular joe businessman who finds himself pulled ever more to the dark side as his relationship with julian deepens
hope davis does a fine job as bean danny 's loyal and loving wife who like her husband finds herself intrigued by this mysterious and dangerous figure from a world far different from the one she knowsbr br at times we find ourselves feeling that the matador is holding something back from us not quite plumbing the depths of its situation and premise
at the end it feels a little too light a little too insubstantial to register the impact it should
this could be because this is the feature film debut for writerdirector richard shephard and he has n't quite gotten his movie pacing down yet
still one appreciates the fact that he does n't always go for the obvious and that he keeps tightly focused on the two main figures in the piece rarely settling for the trite setup or the easy laughbr br 'the matador is a flawed but generally entertaining little comedy that will hopefully signal a new phase in brosnan 's acting career
12 pierce brosnan greg kinnear hope davis adam scott philip baker hall
directed by richard shepardbr br a well formulated story and film all together brosnan has never been better in a film role outside of his bond movies
after 2004 's after the sunset his newest role brings in the laughs and a great time
professional hitman so to speak julian noble on a job in mexico city winds up meeting the exact opposite of himself a high strung business man danny wright also on business there
the two onscreen duo produce a comically charged laugh riot and fail to not deliver the laughs
davis in one of her best roles since american splendor gives another charming and witty performance
one of the years most enjoyable and best films
my final rating 910
think pierce brosnan and you think suave dapper intelligent james bond
in this movie brosnan plays against type and has lots of fun doing so
this is a film about a hired assassin who befriends a harried businessman and it worksbr br this is a fun movie with very good scenes
my only cavil is that hope davis playing the ohsotolerant wife does n't appear more often she could have been a marvellous foil to these menbr br this movie is like a matador it plays with the audience while going for a kill
the ending is awesome because a storyline emerges this is a frenetic frantic and fun movie which does deserve a wide audience
was n't sure what to expect from this film
i love watching brosnan in any movie he 's always good but this was totally different
he 's a mess and plays being a mess very well
in fact he reminded me of myself a few times back in uni so yes there 's not a lot of violence there 's not a lot of action but the dialogue is cracking the acting is superb and very refreshing and it 's pretty funny too i do n't think you 'll come out of the cinema going wow
i was blown away but you 'll come out smiling having enjoyed a good film
ca n't ask for more than thatbr br oh and if you 're lucky some moron will put the adverts reel in wrong and you 'll get inverted upside down reversed adverts
brilliant
nothing like watching a jack daniels ad where the drink goes back into the bottle from the glass with a gruff american twin peaks commentary
i found this to be a profoundly amusing dark comedy
brosnan is genius as anyone will now testify he is not to be pigeonholed in the bond role
kinnear was as charismatic and as funny as anyone could have been in the role
i do n't know if i 've laughed as hard during any movie
what an unexpected pleasure
my favourite line would be 'i feel like a bangkok hooker on a sunday after the navy left town'
brosnan delivered this very unbond line with such unexpected comedic finesse
i was also very impressed with hope davis 's performance
it seems like everyone in this movie branched out from their previous work to such a degree that it actually improved the comedy
if you liked the dark and hilarious 'the weather man' you will definitely like this
br br i voted 10
the matador is a witty dark humored and suspenseful melodrama that rises way above mediocrity thanks to two very engaging and earnest performances from pierce brosnan who has never ever been better than here and the always reliable greg kinnear who has his best role here since playing jack nicholson 's gay neighbor in as good as it gets
a big plus goes to the writing as well
clever and occasionally very nasty dialog is delivered with gusto by brosnan and the slow building friendship between these two different individuals is completely convincing all the way
the story takes a few unexpected turns and keeps the viewer constantly guessing where it 's gonna go nextbr br nice artistic touches from the director such as good use of music clever editing and somewhat unorthodox cinematography at times set a nice tone for the film and for a long period of time you do n't quite know how to label the film
but that 's also thanks to a very well written script which keeps the viewer on the edge of his seat
not to mention easily pierce brosnon 's best performance
of course greg kinnear is always great
really when has he really been bad
i think this film is incredibly underrated
the use of colors in this movie is something very different in today 's film world where every other movie has the payback blue filter
i also love the way they used the song by asia
proving that even what was once thought of as kinda cheesy can be really cool placed correctlybr br i was making my first feature when this came out
being that my film was a hitman movie i had to check out anything in the genre that was released
after seeing it i'm sure it had some effect on me through the process
it was pretty cool when my film got on the imdb that it would recommend this film if you liked mine
how any of the others relate i have no idea making an even more interesting coincidencebr br
a chance encounter between a salesman and a hitman changes both their lives
this is an odd film that works an impressive effort for writerdirector shepard
in a daringly unglamorous role that is a far cry from james bond brosnan is surprisingly effective as the lonely hitman who starts to buckle under the stress of his job but is unable to connect emotionally with anyone to help him cope
kinnear is equally good as the salesman a decent fellow with a void in his life
davis is fine as kinnear 's flirtatious wife
mainly a character study the film is rewarding because it feels fresh and unpredictable an extremely dark comedy
the matador is better upon reflection because at the time one is watching it it seems so light
the humor is always mediumgauge never unfunny but never gutbusting
the story is a very simple thread
the characteristics of the plot are often recycled features namely the unscrupulous bad guy in need of a pal and the straightlaced glasswearing good guy in need of security in life team up and learn from each other and somehow complement each other 's lifestyles
i also find the bullfighting parallel to the story unnecessary as it is a simply cruel thing and the symbolism is hardly potent enough to carry itself
however it really is a good film because though it seemed so thin and unaffecting at the time it was n't
it has a subtle way of connecting with the audiencebr br i believe the reason it slowly but surely gives the audience something to take with them is because though it 's a formula that is nothing new even most of the humor both main characters virtually the only characters in it are somehow met and gotten to know
forget calling them real
that 's not at all what i mean
what i mean is that though pierce brosnan 's filthy womanizing boozing hit man is a detached comical character he 's grasped firmly by the writer and definitely by brosnan who is aggressively communicating how much he enjoys his breath of fresh james bondless air
greg kinnear 's character seems quite the same in his detached scriptedness but he 's given certain very unexpected footnotes that for a moment due to the film 's lightfootedness pass us by but then hit us only a moment later
we then realize the film is not simply analyze this or planes trains and automobiles told stalely over again
its truly saying somethingbr br the film 's climax is of a sort that wants to partially be a thriller with twists
but with its lightness how can that possibly be the focus of the film though the plot has been leading up to it
no the focus is what brosnan and kinnear get out of their unlikely relationship to each other
strangely the matador is a film about regret and loneliness
brosnan deals with loneliness and regret every day and though we do n't understand why kinnear is so lenient and accepting with brosnan continually interrupting his life it 's slowly understood that brosnan is salvaging kinnear from a more downtoearth version of his own feelings as a means of redemption
the very last scene of the movie stays with me
it i think is where the film 's subtle sidestepping impact finally begins to seep
two years ago i watched the matador in cinema and i loved everything about this movie
obviously i was totally under impression of pierce brosan 's magnificent role
yesterday i caught this movie again on tv so i looked at it a bit deeper
now i can say with certain that this movie is n't that special but you just gotta' love it because of one man
br br brosnan lifts its grade up in my opinion with amazing performance of julian noble tired hitman who has no friends
soon julian meets danny wright in mexico city man who 's got bad luck his son died in accident his job is n't going that well and he 's not sure that he can keep his wife bean br br i always liked movies like this crime movie with big touch of humor
mostly that humor comes from brosnan as he tells jokes about dwarfs with big d or one of my favorite lines in this movie i look like a bangkok hooker on a sunday morning after the navy 's left town
brosnan says it with his charm while he 's drinking his margarita as usually
i also like greg 'typical american face' kinnear in the role of loser that is very lively made because there are plenty of people like danny wrightbr br so i recommend you to watch quite possibly the best role of brosnan ever
he 'll make you smile and admire him at the same time
great brosnan in not equally great movie
julian noble is a hitman
or a facilitator of fatalities as he prefers to be called
he is also a drunk a womaniser and in the middle of a midlife crisis
on a job in mexico city he bumps into danny white an unconfident businessman who thinks he 's just nailed a recent pitch but is unsure
they meet in the hotel bar late one night after they 've both had a few too many margaritasbr br sounds like the setup for a bythenumbers comedy thriller does n't it
but it is n't
instead the matador is a funny and sometimes touching character study
it avoids every twist that the above summary would suggest sometimes even setting them up just to gleefully tear them down
it is a film that respects it characters enough to just let them get on with it without feeling the need to shove them into needless plot contrivancesbr br brosnan 's hitman will inevitably be compared to his bond but this is unfair to both performances
bond is a halfformed idea a product of all that has gone before while julian is a fullyformed character with his own motivations and flaws
he has existed in his own shadowy seedy world for so long that he has forgotten how to talk to another human beingbr br when he meets danny in the hotel bar he sees his opposite a normal guy with a normal job and normal problems
he envies danny the hitman has become fed up with his life sees himself edging ever closer to his inevitable burn out as he puts it
but when danny opens up about the death of his only son julian tries to change the subject with a dirty joke
he is a man who has in his own words been running from any emotion
kinnear holds his own opposite brosnan 's performance and injects danny white with his effortless everyman charm
he is the perfect foil to julian while the latter is drunken bravado and hedonism danny is down to earth with just a hint of eccentricity
but he too goes deeper than his established persona showing us how far the everyman will go when faced with financial and familial ruinbr br there is real chemistry between brosnan and kinnear
it is most visible in the film 's three key scenes the hotel bar a bullfight during which julian tells danny what he does for a living and takes him through a dress rehearsal of an assassination and a scene in which julian turns up at danny 's house six months later
this scene also introduces us properly to danny 's wife bean
in another example of how much the matador respects its characters bean instead of panicking at the presence of a hired killer in her house merely asks with forced calm did you bring your gun
the script is n't quite as good as could have been after maybe another rewrite
one or two lines seem a little forced and a couple of the jokes need a little more work
but in the scenes where julian and danny just talk the writing is superb
the film feels no need to put the characters in any outlandish situations
it just lets them talk gently nudging them toward necessary plot pointsbr br there is action but only when it reflects on the characters
one notable instance is when julian botches a job in budapest because he keeps seeing himself through his rifles scope
the rest of the film is about the characters how they interact how they each affect one another
and ultimately it is about friendship even in the most unlikely of places
at one point julian tells danny that he is his only friend
and he really means it
the turning point in the matador comes about half through the movie when danny an unsophisticated man from denver is sitting in the balcony of his mexico city hotel enjoying a quiet moment
someone knocks on his door and knowing it 's julian the paid assassin he refuses to answer
but did he really
br br richard shephard the director of the matador presents us with a character julian noble who shows no redeemable qualities
in fact we have already seen him in action doing what he does best
when julian meets danny at the bar of the camino real in mexico city he spills the beans and tells his new acquaintance what he really does for a livingbr br danny who has come to sell his program to a mexican company but it seems he is competing against a local outfit that appears to be in the front for getting the contract
danny is a naive person who falls prey of the charisma and charm doled out by the smarter julian
it 's not until some time later on a cold winter night that the killer appears at danny 's door asking his friend to repay a favor and accompany him on a trip to tucson
it 's at this point that the secret that binds them together is revealed in an unexpected waybr br pierce brosnan acting against type makes a great contribution with his irreverent julian noble
just to watch him walking through the hotel lobby in his speedo and boots gives the right impression about his character
greg kinnear on the other hand plays the straight part of this odd couple
hope davis appears only in a couple of scenes leaving us to lament why did n't she stay longer
philip baker hall puts an appearance as the liaison between julian and his assignmentsbr br richard shephard directs with style working with his own material
the musical score is by rolfe kent and the crisp cinematography of david tattersall enhances everything
the matador is a strange film
its main character julian played with an unusual mix of charm and unbalance by brosnan is not your typical hero
julian is a hit man who is experiencing a late midlife crises
having spent 22 years in the profession of cold blooded murder he now finds himself stressed out and desperately lonely
and so after a chance meeting at a bar with danny he latches on and begins a halting awkward friendship
danny the quintessential nice guy is dealing with some stuff in his own life and truth be told could use a friend as well
the two make an unexpected connection and danny sticks around to hear julian 's story even after learning the unsavory truth about julian 's workbr br matador approaches a subject not completely unheard of in cinema the antihero assassin
but matador differs in several key ways
first of all the killing and gore is implied but never really shown in any detail meaning that if you are an action movie buff looking for an adrenaline rush this movie will probably disappoint you
and second unlike most antihero films matador makes no attempt to show remorse and redemption from its main character
julian 's job is simply presented as an 'it is what it is' kind of thing
this is unusual given that 9999 of us would consider killing for money horrific
and yet this unorthodox approach is perhaps what makes the film feel authentic
although we do n't like to admit it almost anything could become mundane after we did it long enough maybe even murder
did julian 's victims deserve to die
who is paying to have people killed
who knows
the movie never deals with these questions
the focus is on julian and his stumbling shuffle into a genuine friendship
if you read about someone like julian in the paper you would have a passing thought that people like him should be ripped out of society like a cancer but forced to watch his life you are drawn in by his intense humanity
sympathy for the devil i guessbr br brosnan 's take on julian is well done and deeply unsettling
he does n't completely divorce himself from his james bond good looks and smooth charm but rather just adds disturbing quirks into the mix
weird or crude remarks in the middle polite conversations and sudden shifts from suave charm to childish tantrums and sad desperate pleas for acceptance
it keeps you guessing about his grasp on his sanity and how it will affect those around him
it 's a bit like listening to a piano player that occasionally and unexpectedly hits a wrong note while he plays but it works
the films only other major role that of danny is not nearly as meaty
kinnear turns in a solid if unspectacular performance as a regular joe with a regular joe life and problemsbr br the film does n't really have any huge shocks or m night shyamalan twists but i was n't able to guess the ending and it felt satisfying
it does n't have any deep philosophical or spiritual insights and yet it felt very human
and it did n't have any heart pounding car chases or gun battles and yet i thought the pacing was well done and i was never bored
maybe the only real message here is about the human need to reach out and make connections with one another and how those needs have no moral prerequisites
even a murderer needs friends and even good people can be friends with bad people
it 's a comment on the strange random world we live in
a good film worth seeing
the matador _ pierce brosnan greg kinnear hope davis philip baker hall dylan baker
brosnan gives one of his best nonbondian roles as a middleaged assassin facing a midlife crisis while on assignment in mexico where he befriends a square yet likable american businessman and discovers there is more to life than death
newbie filmmaker richard shepard makes a solid big screen debut with a pointedly wicked black comedy with a sharp eye for visual detail and nuanced dialogue and character development that makes him a talent to watch in this breathoffreshair into the 'buddy comedy' formula skewering what is anticipated of his leads and allowing brosnan to get his yayas out with devilish glee
a sleeper gem indie hit
pierce brosnan has sipped his last martini and returns in an outrageous selfparody as the aging foulmouthed boozy assassin julian noble who has a particular fondness for teenage girls bullfights and tacky clothes
during a job in mexico city he meets danny a straightfaced denver suburban businessman who 's in town to make his deal ofalifetime in a hotel bar
despite their completely different personalities and julian 's crude and insensible remarks they become friends
br br largely carried by the performances of pierce brosnan and greg kinnear director richard shepard revealed that he did n't write the film with pierce brosnan in mind but i can hardly imagine this without him
he proves to have a real talent for comedy and can be more than just james bond or coldwar spies
the scene in which the two meet at a glossy hotel bar really is a bravura piece of acting skills
the scene lasts almost fifteen minutes and although it was probably carefully scripted the two actors are largely improvising but they succeed wonderfully
it almost feels like a new standard in screen acting
think of robert de niro and harvey keitel in mean steets improvising and add one of the most subtle underpinnings of many genre clichs and the actors' own typecasting and you got one of the most delightful pairings in recent hollywood
br br sadly the story wears thin after a while
after an hour the film just runs out of steam
nevertheless and i ca n't put my finger on it exactly i did enjoy this very much
it just feels very fresh and original with some imaginative use of sets and lighting and some hints to seijun suzuki and jeanpierre melville
the other characters are n't given much to do but this film does offer something new in that respect it almost effortlessly succeeds in blending all conventional genres into quite an entertaining spoof
very amusingbr br camera obscura 710
the matador is hitman movie lite if you can say that about a hitman movie
the violence is never really shown but often introduced
at first i was scared i was in for another retread of mid90s gangsterhitmanhipsterdark comedy but was happily surprised when i realized this is just a sweet and humorous story about friendship
nothing terribly exciting happens in this film but every bit of it is kept me grinning
the three leads have the best chemistry the big screen has offered in recent years and it looks like they had a great time making this film together
the writing is sharp though at times it felt as if the script had been adapted from a stage play because of the one set dialog scenes
this is a good film that i probably wo n't remember for too long but at the time it was a complete joy
good film
the matador stars pierce brosnan as a burned out assassin
he 's james bond gone to seed in tootight garish clothes gold chains and an ugly haircut
our struggling assassin julian noble is in mexico trying to regain his nerve
staying at the same hotel is a likable downonhis luck businessman danny wright also trying to regain his equilibrium
danny is desperate to close a deal and return to his wife in denver with good newsbr br noble and wright unexpectedly become friends
wright convinces noble to reveal certain techniques which he demonstrates at a bullfight
noble is eventually targeted by his employers and shows up in denver
br br writer and director richard shepard did the qa after this delightful movie at the austin film festival
shepard was also down on his luck
after suffering the loss of his agent and rejection of recent scripts he decided to write a story no one would buy and create a character no one would want to play
then pierce brosnan called
brosnan regains his equilibrium in this movie
he has a wonderful flair for selfdeprecating comedy
do n't miss it
br br stay for the closing credits to read what the filmmakers say about bullfighting
i look forward to more of richard shepard 's projects
margaritas and cock br br this tremendously entertaining film grabs you from the opening scene and never stops delivering laughs surprises and unexpectedly touching moments
i had more fun watching the matador than almost any other film from 2005 it is a wacky film with an unforgettable character played to perfection by pierce brosnanbr br julian noble is a facilitator who specializes in highend corporate gigs
he is also experiencing something akin to a midlife crisis
after coming to realization that he has no real friends no permanent home and no planned future he stumbles into a mexican hotel bar one night and runs into danny wright br br danny is a downonhisluck family man who is on the verge of losing the big business deal that just might turn things around for him
he loves his wife dearly especially so since they lost their young son a few years earlierbr br the two men are chalk and cheese hardly any common ground other than that they are in the same desolate bar one night
and somehow a conversation is struck that sets in to motion a chain of events that will change their lives foreverbr br the friendship they form reminded me a lot of laurel and hardy
one is the straight man and the other is the persistent fool who gets them into trouble
the interplay is superbly timed and finely tuned due in no small part to the wonderful performances from brosnan and kinnearbr br but make no mistake this is brosnan 's film
he imprints one of the most memorable and despicably likable characters of the decade
he could shoot your mother and apologize immediately thereafter and you 'd probably forgive him
brosnan may be cinema 's ultimate charmer but this is his most endearing and complete performance to date
i would n't be averse to seeing an oscar nod for this rolebr br consider one scene where he overtly ogles a highschool girl with the impurest of thoughts and utters the line all blushy blushy no sucky fucky
he does it with the familiar bond smirk and manages to get away with it
he manages to tell a young boy tell your mother to lose 30lbs and 20 years
then get back to me without coming across as unlikable
in fact it makes us like him even morebr br and yet the film manages to surprise us with some truly touching scenes most of which come toward the end when the film takes some unpredictable turns
however when julian thumbs through his little black book to find someone to call on his birthday or when danny and his wife console each other in their bedroom one night the film reaches an unexpected depth of emotionbr br the matador is stylish and energetic
it is constantly entertaining
and it contains a careerdefining role for brosnan as the lonely hitman looking for normalcy friendship and a means to do at least one good thing in his life
this is an overlooked gem in 2005 and you should make an effort to see this film as soon as possiblebr br tc candler of independentcriticscom
this film is fantastic
finally wellwritten characters you can love for all their good and bad
pierce brosnan is flatout hysterical in this selfeffacing role
i think its the best thing he 's ever done
he 's done other roles that exhibited shades of being capable of this kind of fullyfledged work but this role finally gave him the room to run with it
i almost died when he walked across the hotel lobby in his underwear and boots
and greg kinnear and hope davis are a couple to aspire too as well as actors to aspire too
kinnear is so goofy likable that his turn in the end is truly gratifying
you give good actors good work to play with and they give us something more back
the delivery of some very humorous rude lines by pierce brosnan is alone worth the price of admission
he plays a kind of james bond 's psycho twin brother separated at birth no doubt
as an intense hitman his character is very sexual but even better very funny
add the kindhearted uberlikable american guy next door' greg kinnear to set up contrast
the myriad locations vivid colors and quickwitted humor provide great entertainment
hope davis is well cast as the gem of a wife
but the focus of the film is on the two fellows a new odd couple and that 's the part that works very well
have a great laugh and look for the places where the story goes a little deeper
greetings again from the darkness
much anticipated twisted comedy from writerdirector richard shepard is a coming out party for pierce brosnan the actor
that bond guy is gone
this new guy is something else entirely
have read that shepard thought brosnan was too much the pretty boy for this plum role but brosnan proves to be the perfect julian noble facilitator and is anything but pretty
do not underestimate how twisted the humor is in this one
if you go expect punch lines and sight gags regarding all types of sex killing religion sports business and anything else you might deem politically incorrect
brosnan takes an excellent script to another level with his marvelous facial gestures and physical movements
even sitting on a hotel bed is a joy to beholdbr br greg kinnear is the straight guy to brosnan 's comic and has plenty of depth and comic timing to make this partnership click
hope davis has a small but subtly effective supporting role as kinnear 's wife who happens to get a little excited when she has a facilitator in her living roombr br the visuals and settings are perfect including a bullfight racetrack and denver suburb
and how often do we get the killers and xavier cugat on the same soundtrack
this one is definitely not for everyone but if your sense of humor is a bit off center and you enjoy risky filmmaking it could be for you
this film has a rotting core of flexible morality and yet a quirky sense of justice
so many of the regular joes among us would love to stick it to the man
the man in this case is represented by several different characters
mr keller who carla reports to at her office
later paul owes 70 large to mr marchand the club owner
and then there is paul 's parole officer
there seems to be so much question about this last character 's side story
reviewers point it out as a weakness in an otherwise well crafted subterranean game of pingpong between our two protagonists escalating titfortat until their lives change dramatically
they are beholden to each agent of the man
one or both could be fired killed or imprisoned if they do n't do as they are toldbr br the film has a sense of relief at the end
carla finally gets laid
her boss is forced out for being a jerk
mr club owner is a pulpy mess in his own bathroom
they get the money
and they need not worry about reporting in to the parole officer because his moral weakness leads him to stash his wandering wife in the basement
it is a critical subconscious trigger to the lock tumbler that wound us up so tight
never mind that someone else may get paul 's file later to supervise his release for the moment they are free
they might even get away with it
br br woohoo br br they stuck it to the man
it 's so rare to find a film that provides a plot that ca n't be figured out at every turn
surprises throughout delighting throughoutbr br a couple of things i could not quite understand though is that here you have the lead female character who plays the good girl hard worker and yet in the end she ends up being an antisocial risk taker
that was not enough to make me not like it though but it did give me pausebr br the other thing i could not get was the old man who was being hauled away by the police at the very end of the film
i never did get who he was or what his issues were
if anyone has any ideas i 'd like to hear what they might bebr br the film was exciting and fun throughout and always left me guessing
very much worth seeing
audiard made here a very interesting movie
it begins with the description of an almostdeaf young woman in its working universe as a secretary she is ignored frustrated rejected hiring an intern as an assistant appears to be a way for her to find someone in her life but the guy is just coming out from jail
their both being rejected by the society reunites them progressively
characters 'description is profund goes into details both start to help each other for she can read on lips which reveals itself to be very useful for him she will progressively evolve far from what she was at firstbr br it 's beautifully filmed the whole is very convincing even if it turns into a film noir at the end
gesture is in particular beautifully observed in audiard 's filming
emmanuelle devos should be nominated at the best actess cesar awards for her magistral play
action towards the end of the film prevents it from being a simple etude de moeurs
it 's actually surprisingly entertaining 810
what can you say when you see a good french movie which tries to draw a suspenseful story in line with the social background of the characters
the major point is we believe in those characters and once they 've met each other we want them to stay together
it 's simple and really efficient
the background story is less important
why does the screenplay go on the side of a halfdeveloped thriller
it helps not to get stuck in those social demonstrations most french filmjerkers like to make
not too much ambition right sur mes lvres is only an entertaining french film with good characterizationbr br for all the clever noir points in the screenplay the end is by far too easy
it goes quite as easy as in rear window but with a less compelling context
where i am amazed it 's to see that the character of the probation officer has not been erased
he brings very little to the story when he appears alone we wonder if we 've not missed a part before
jacques audiard is not a newcomer yet
strange and weird
carla is a secretary who is essentially deaf without her hearing aids
when she finds herself overloaded at work she is able to hire paul to help her out
paul is just out of jail and his past is not entirely behind him
to say too much more about the story which has many twists would be a mistakebr br the most interesting thing about this film for me is how sound is used to indicate when carla can hear and when she ca n't a sort of point of hear
the early scenes that set this up as well as the early character development of carla and paul was more interesting to me than the twists and turns later on some of which were hard to follow andor stretched credibility a bit
there is also some unpleasant violence
back to the positive side the cinematography was very goodbr br the film is worth seeing but perhaps not seeking out
seen at the san francisco international film festival on 4282002
i was totally engrossed in this film from the first to last minute
it is brilliantly shot with lots of interesting and original camera angles and techniques employed
the plot surrounds a deaf woman who is picked on by friends and colleagues alike
she hires an assistant at work with her true intention being to find love
he 's an excon and she takes advantage of him to wreak revenge on those who have hurt her
in return she must help him with a heist that requires her lip reading skills to pull it off
the film transcends into a dark film noir with a couple of truly excellent scenes and an even better finale
the real beauty in this film comes from the way the director takes advantage of the leading character 's disability
the use of sound keeps the tension consistent and the dramatic shifts from silence to noise keeps the blood pumping that 's for sure
throw in a little black comedy and undertones of erotic sexual repression you 've got the makings of a great film
it 's the sort of film hollywood really wants to make but just ca n't
surely one the french films of the decade so far a taut atmospheric thriller making full use of the lead characters hearing impediment to use sound in a way rarely explored in cinema
emannuelle devos gives a truly stunning multifaceted performance at times devious and manipulative at other times open and vulnerable
another reason why those who appreciate quality cinema should keep their eyes open for offerings from france
vincent cassel plays the part of paul an excon assigned to an office job where he meets carla a secretary who is quite deaf' when she has her hearing aids in very deaf when not
together they help each other to develop as peoplebr br what was particularly interesting about this film was the complexity of the characters not fitting into obvious stereotypes
paul appears uneasy in the office environment is it that he 's just not cut out for work
this belief is dispelled when he gets a job in a bar and shinesbr br the film has a certain amorality which i find refreshing and showed how easy is to act criminally even if we think it is harmless or justifiedbr br finally it is a film full of great moments' both touching and humorous
one is when carla is babysitting and is trying to comfort a screaming baby
she continues to cuddle it but takes her hearing aids out for her own comfort
put yourself into carla 's shoes
she is an overworked unappreciated administrative drudge who is invisible
you know her she 's trained three of her last three bosses knows where all of the bodies are buried and might even look back at you in the mirror when you brush your teeth
always having time for another thankless task and does it better than most despite a serious disability she has the desk on the way to the restroom that becomes the repository of halffinished cups of coffee begging to be spilled
what
you do n't want to hear it
well she ca n't and neither can you until your hearing aid is in place
prepare to experience life from the perspective of the hearing impairedbr br carla needs a change in her life
work is leading nowhere friends are relying on her to meet their domestic needs and the only way out starts with a collapse that goes virtually unnoticed
she wo n't take a vacation a contract is going critical so the only alternative is to hire an assistant
carla submits requirements that convey her real needs a 'wellgroomed' man
this brings an applicant for approval that reminds us that we should be careful with our wishes
br br paul does everything wrong from the start of his job interview and his getting hired clearly demonstrates carla 's interest in his nonjobrelated qualities
she sees potential in this former thief and as the story unfolds their relationship grows in a very unusual pattern of codependence
br br paul has a difficult transition returning to the world outside of prison walls and finds himself in another sort of prison one of the office variety and another of indentured servitude to pay off an old debt
his skills as a thief help carla win a political battle in the office
but paul sees a grander opportunity with carla 's skill in lip reading and draws her even further into a world of intriguebr br this is a brutal film noir unrated and probably suitable for older teens
carla grows more powerful professionally as well as personally as the story progresses and her disability gives her clear advantages over the rest of us
she grows as a woman discovering her sensual side while she uses her resources to overcome the obstacles of competing in a man 's worldbr br the two main characters are meant for each other in a strange way
without paul carla will remain in her role of a doormat
she has our sympathy hopes and best wishes even if she does n't make the best decisions along the way
br br you will hear the world through carla 's ears from awkward adjustments of your hearing aid muffled sounds all but inaudible without it to relatively distinct voices when you can see who 's talking
with one major sense disabled we see carla 's heightened intuitive power to compensate
and we can all use that sense to hear not only what people say but also what they really mean
as in amelie recent french films seem to be taking a stereotypical malefemale relationship slant centered on a female finding her one true love
in this case desperation leads to a convict which leads to her evolution into a mob prototype
clever and surprising story in many ways except that the female is there to support the malebr br for those of us that do n't speak french the subtitles are a little quick but not unreasonablebr br the soundtrack as seems to be increasingly the case with european films is great and in perfect sync with the film 's variations
nothing seems forced
visually it reminds me of various urban horror movies
there 's a wes craven in chicago feel to it
what is very french about this film is the time taken to establish the two leading characters
this might require a bit of patience especially since neither is attractive in the typical hollywood definition of such
however once the heist kicks in the film rushes forward quickly perhaps at times too quickly
but it is a real rollercoaster ride and if you do n't look too closely it is all quite believable
the kind of film that you know hollywood would have botched up
deaf secretary carla is bullied by her mean spirited male colleaguesbr br when they suggest she needs an assistant it seems like the final insult but when the first applicant is excon paul she seizes the chance to change her lifebr br carla covers his mistakes and he anxious to go straight reluctantly helps her to take revenge on her colleaguesbr br when paul asks carla to return the favor she finds herself drawn into the criminal underworld ruled by ruthless lone shark marchand br br recognizing her ability to lipread as a weapon no one will have bargained for the two set out to see justice donebr br french filmmaker jacques audiard 's third feature read my lips is a genredefying piece switching from dark social comedy to visceral fullthrottle thriller
read my lips is a nifty twisty contemporary tale of office politics that unexpectedly becomes a crime caper as the unusually matched characters slide up and down an ethical and sensual slippery slopebr br the two leads are magnetic emmanuelle devos and an even more disheveled than usual vincent cassel br br the first half of the movie is on her turf in a competitive real estate office and he 's the neophyte
the second half is on his turf as an excon and her wrenching adaptation to that milieubr br writerdirector jacques audiard very cleverly uses the woman 's isolating hearing disability as an entre for us into her perceptions turning the sound up and down for us to hear as she does using visuals as sensory reactors as wellbr br none of the characters act as anticipated as we move from a hectic modern office to a hectic disco to romantic and criminal stakeouts
br br there is a side story that 's thematically redundant and unnecessary but that just gives us a few minutes to catch our breathsbr br this is one of my favorites of the year
br br
sur mes lvres or read my lips is fine little thriller that also examines the lives of 'outsiders' people who live in the periphery of our vision who struggle with the need to 'fit in'
director jacques audiard with and cowriter tonino benacquista have created a tense tight completely entertaining little thriller that makes some significant statements about out of the norm individuals and their plightsbr br carla is a plain jane mostly deaf thirty something unnoticed secretary for a company whose life is one of social and sexual isolation and whose view of the future is rather bleak
enter paul a recent released excon parolee who responds to an ad to be carla 's assistant
there is a mutual physical repulsion at first meeting carla had hoped for a wellgroomed genteel man who might fulfill her fantasies and paul is a coarse unkempt sleazy guy who is not impressed with being a clerk
their concepts change rather quickly when paul salvages carla 's job by filling her request to steal a letter that would cost her her job and paul discovers carla 's lip reading ability which he sees as a way to spy on the criminals from his past who threaten his life for money owed
so this odd couple of a team join forces and together enter a dangerous suspense filled ploy to gain paul 's safety and freedom
the relationship is full of twists and edge of the seat suspense with each of these unlikely characters fulfilling roles in their lives that fill the chinks in their walls of isolation in surprising waysbr br devos and cassel deliver bravura performances and the remainder of the cast is uniformly strong
once again alexandre desplat has produced a musical score that enhances the tension and cinematographer mathieu vadepied finds all the right lighting and angles to suggest the worlds of isolation of the characters as well as the hitchcockian sense of suspense
director audiard wisely manipulates a factor that is at once sensitive and transformative for the story he shows us the difference between 'hearing' the world with and without hearing aids and in doing so makes some powerful social comments
this is a fine film that remains in the ranks of the best of the french film noir genre

grady harp
carla works for a property developer 's where she excels in being unattractive unappreciated and desperate
she is also deafbr br her boss offers to hire in somebody to alleviate her heavy workload so she uses the opportunity to secure herself some male company
help arrives in the form of paul a tattooed hoodlum fresh out of prison and clearly unsuited to the mannered routine of an office environmentbr br an implicit sexual tension develops between the two of them and carla is determined to keep him on despite his reluctance to embrace the working week
when carla is edged out of an important contract she was negotiating by a slimy colleague she exploits paul 's criminality by having him steal the contract back
the colleague quickly realises that she 's behind the robbery but when he confronts her paul 's readiness to punch people in the face comes in handy too but this thuggery comes at a price
br br paul is given a 'going over' by some mob acquaintances as a reminder about an unpaid debt
he formulates a plan which utilises carla 's unique lip reading abilities to ripoff a gang of violent bank robbers
it 's now carla 's turn to enter a frightening new worldbr br the fourth feature from director jacques audiard 'read my lips' begins as a thoroughly engaging romantic drama between two marginalised losers only to shift gears halfway through into an edgy thriller where their symbiotic shortcomings turn them into winners
the leads are excellent effortlessly convincing us that this odd couple could really connect
carla 's first meeting with paul is an enjoyable farce in which she attempts to circumnavigate his surly reticence and jailbird manners only to discover that he was until very recently a jailbird
emmanuelle devos who plays carla has that almost exclusive ability to go from dowdy to gorgeous and back again within a frame
vincent cassel plays paul as a cornered dog who only really seems at home when he 's receiving a beating or concocting the ripoff that is likely to get him killedbr br like many french films 'read my lips' appears at first to be about nothing in particular until you scratch beneath the surface and find that it 's probably about everything
the only bum note is a subplot concerning the missing wife of paul 's parole officer a device that seems contrived only to help steer the main thrust of the story into a neat little feelgood culdesacbr br it was the french 'new wave' of the 60 's that first introduced the concept of 'genre' to film making and i 've always felt that any medium is somewhat compromised when you have to use a system of labels to help define it so it 's always a pleasure to discover a film that seems to transcend genre or better still defy it
i watched this film not expecting much and not knowing anything much about it
i loved it
a very good tight plot an intriguing hook in the form of the ugly fat deaf girl and the excon and a pace that kept things flowing without being hurried
br br a much much better film than the same director 's de battre mon coeur s'est arret which was boring and unbelievablebr br the only thing that did n't quite work was that the supposedly ugly fat girl was neither ugly nor fat solid certainly and far from conventionally beautiful but with so much character in her face that she took over the screen whenever she was on it
superb
i wish she was in more films and better ones than she generally is
i 've seen a bit of gilles' wife and a bit of the moustache and they both looked like rubbish and i 've seen all of de battre mon coeur s'est arret and that certainly is rubbish
she seems to have a few coming up so i 'll keep my fingers crossed
this movie just pulls you so deeply into the two main characters
i popped it into my laptop without even reading the cover and was intrigued for two solid hours
two lost ships from two different worlds collide
the sexual tension that brews between a secretary and a criminal is almost palpable even without hardly any physical contact
toward the end i could n't decide which i wanted more our hero and heroine to pull off their caper or simply consummate their passion
rml could 've done without a curious subplot and a traditional 100 minutes would have been plenty
i'm nitpicking though
after a series of netflix blockbuster and local library duds this movie restored my faith in great film making
well what can i say having just watched this fantastic film when my nerves are still jangling
jacques audiard the director must be making quite a name for himself in france and rightly so
vince cassel is no tom cruise and emmanuelle devos is no penelope cruz either but these two are fantastic actors and this is a taut and compelling thriller which starts off slowly with some clever character building and then starts to put tension on tension to a wonderful climax
others have written about the plot so i will not say more than everyone in this film plays their role to perfection the director the actors right down to the cameraman and everything seems so real no stupid gun play the fighting when it happens is so credible the expressions the emotions it is almost as you are there as a spectator
do yourself a favour get the dvd a bottle of wine turn the lights low take the phone off the hook and immerse yourself in this hitchcockian thriller
a super unusual film from audiard read my lips is a pulpy lonely hearts thriller
it 's perfect for the handsomely grizzled charisma of vincent cassel and features a marvellously contained performance from emanuelle devos
devos is a recurring feature of audiard in the same way that karin viard pops up for jeanpierre jeunet unconventionally beautiful versatile and capable of a subordinate profilebr br this is almost the definition of her role as carla a putupon office dogsbody taunted by colleagues exploiting her deafness
yet she finds an ami d'exploitation if you like in cassel 's excon paul
each exploits the other 's unconventional talents to struggle through their respective situations and form an unconventionally romantic rapprochement
devosaudiard manage carla 's deafness and its attendant warped inner world with discreet stylish flairbr br in this film audiard is already clearly in control of his handling on tension action and investing his frame with a truly visceral experience which will become the great hit a prophet of nine years later

jeanjacques' career began with his essay answer to a prize question civilization makes us evil
this intelligent and exciting movie supports that argument
in that sense it repeats a theme common to french films society is real identity is a construction freedom is criminal
here the idea is treated literally
both main characters find themselves and each other only when breaking rules
this discovery may well hold true in france at any rate it 's quite romantic
interesting characters lots of tension
as close to black and white without being black and white
i was turned off by how casually the supposedly sympathetic mainstream character a quiet near deaf secretary was able to turn to crime to ruin colleagues rough up people in her way and finally participate in a heist and set up someone to be bumped off as a decoy to her own getaway
i'm a little put off by the trend for otherwise quality movies to portray criminals in a sympathetic way without addressing the injury they 've done to others other than to portray their immediate opponents as jerks
in this film we never know who 's money it really is they abscond with or what happens to the innocent wife who the sympathetic deafsecretary uses to set up the of the sleazy bar owner to take the fall for the missing loot
too bad the film could have been great
after erasing my thoughts nearly twentyseven times there is a feeling that i can now conquer this review for the complex french drama read my lips
having written over five hundred reviews i have never found myself at such a loss of words as i did with director jacques audiard 's subtle yet inspirational love story
thought was poured over what was loved and hated about this film and while the loves overpowered it was the elements that were hated that sparked further debate within my mind
read my lips is a drama
to be more precise is a character driven drama which fuses social uncertainty with crime lords with the doldrums of everyday office work
here is where this review begins to crumble it is all of these items but it is more much much more
as a viewer you are pulled in instantly by emmanuelle devos' portrayal of this fragile woman named carla whose strength is lost to the males in her office as well as her hearing difficulty
audiard introduces us harshly to her world by removing sound from the screen whenever she is not wearing her aid causing an immediate unrest not only from the characters within the film but to those watching
without sound the world is left open to any possibility and that is frighteningbr br as we watch this difficult and unsettling woman setting into her life we are then uprooted and given the opportunity to meet paul a slickedback hair mustachewearing lanky man who was just released from prison homeless jobless and forced by his parole officer to get a job
this is how carla and paul meet
there is that moment of instant unsettling attraction
the one where we think she loves him but he is dark and where we think he loves her but she is dark
the constant role reversal creates the tone of the unknown
who as viewers are we to feel the most sympathy for
paul sleeps in the office carla helps him carla looses a contract to a rival coworker paul helps her carla 's ability to read people 's lips comes in handy for a makeshift idea for paul
the continual jumps back and forth keep you on your chair waiting for the possibility of some light to shine through this dark cave
it never does
audiard cannot just allow this story to take place he continually introduces us to more characters one just as seedy as the next
even our rock our solid foundation with the parole officer is in question when his wife goes missing a subplot to this film that at first angered me but upon further debate was a staple finale for this film
yet none of this could have happened if it were n't for our characters
devos' solemn and homely look is breathtaking as she changes her image for paul the truth of her beauty is discovered
paul the wildcard in the film continues to seemingly use and abuse the friendship for his final endgame
then just as we assume one carla takes on one last shapebr br audiard knows he has amazing actors capturing his characters
cassel and devos could just play cards the entire time and i would still be sitting at the end of my chair
the story probably the weakest part of this film is at first random
the interwoven stories seem unconnected at first but audiard lets them connect bit by bit
again the entire parole officer segment was tangent but that final scene just solidified the ends to the means
not attempting to sound vague but this complex story is difficult to explain
there is plenty happening but it is up to you to connect the pieces
a favorite scene is when carla is attempting to discover where some money is being held
that use of sound and scene was brilliant
it was tense it was dramatic and it was like watching a whodunit mystery unfold before your eyesbr br overall i initially though this was a mediocre french film that i could easily forget about when it was over i was proved wrong
read my lips opens the floor for discussion not just with the characters but the situations
one will find themselves rooting for carla in one scene and paul in the next
when a discovery is made in paul 's apartment by carla i found myself deeply angry
audiard brought true emotion to the screen with his characters and development and what he was lacking in plot the actors were able to carry
i can easily suggest this film to anyone but be prepared this is n't a one time viewing film
repeat
repeat
repeatbr br grade out of
probably the best film of the year for me
this small french film centers on put upon office secretary carla who spends her days doing other men 's jobs uncredited and being the source of their scorn and lunchtime conversation which is all too clear to her as being partially deaf she reads lips
a change is set in motion when she hires newly paroled con paul as her assistant
the relationship which develops between them is the centre of the film
mutual dependency for vastly different reasons bonds them
carla becomes attracted to paul and to the fact that he makes her feel attractive forwhat seems likethe first time
paul does nothing to dispel her feelings because he needs her help
he owes money to a local gangster and forms a plan to steal from him which will involve carlas' skill of reading lips
i think the main thing that pushes the film way above an average suspensedrama is the amazing chemistry between the two stars
throughout the whole film no matter what other characters are on screen you can feel this amazing bond between carla and paul
i cannot remember when i have witnessed such sexual chemistry between two actors
emmanuell devos gives a brilliant performance
you never feel like you are watching a piece of acting this really is carla
the chameleon like vincent cassel is also wonderful
he makes a somewhat unappealing character both appealing and attractive
i loved this film because of these two people and both times when i had finished watching it i wanted to go back into the cinema and become involved with them all over again
read my lips tells of a strange symbiosis which develops between a plain socially maladroit female office worker and her workplace trainee a crude excon
as the film fleshes out this unlikely duo down to their ids they become embroiled in a chilling merging of the minds each using the other for their own selfish reasons with an extraordinary outcome
good stuff for anyone into characterdriven films with strong psychodramatic undercurrents
in french with easy to read subtitles and good translation
i picked this one up on a whim from the library and was very pleasantly surprised
lots of tight expressionistic camera work an equally tight script and two superb actors all meld together to make one very fine piece of film
not for the reptilian multiplex brain but rather the true aficionado of cinema
if hollywood ever does get its grimy hands on it i'm sure it will ruin it
a choice treat all the way around
other posters here have more than amply sung its praises so i need n't bother duplicating their paeans just take their advice and mine and do n't miss this gem
call it what you like i call it two hours of entertainment wellspent
read my lips do n't miss it
i settled back to watch read my lips a plate of freedom fries before me
the food was quickly forgotten as i became engrossed by director and cowriter jacques audiard 's original and superb thrillerbr br carla is a secretary at a firm that develops major building projects
she actually has some significant responsibilities that do n't often fall to secretaries and she 's capable and ambitious
and thwarted by a male hierarchy that will exploit but not reward herbr br work piling up faster than she can handle it carla is told to hire a secretary
enter excon and general layabout paul
he lies about his skills and in fact has none that any legitimate enterprise might require
after an initial serious misunderstanding by paul as to carla 's interest in him the two become allies
a quirky friendship starts
in a stunt that would have made a real carla a major contender on the apprentice she trumps her egotistic male adversary at work with paul 's connivance
exit the rivalbr br carla is virtually deaf without her hearing aid
with it she hears almost normally
she turns the hearing aid off to isolate herself from unpleasant sounds and annoying people
she 's also very lonely
a heroic makeup effort was made to have her appear plain but she 's truly beautiful
she has n't a boyfriend
she babysits so a friend can have a liaison worse and humiliatingly she accedes to a girlfriend 's plea that she hang out somewhere while that married friend has it off with her paramour in carla 's bed
not nicebr br as carla and paul get to know each other better the barely repressed larcenous side of the not so former felon emerges
there 's a side story by the way of paul 's relationship with his parole officer which neatly complements the main plot and has its own big surprise endingbr br read my lips
ingenious paul recognizes that carla 's ability to read lips even from a considerable distance is more than the amusing parlor trick it first seems to bebr br from there a caper develops
enough saidbr br paul and carla are a true criminal oddball couple
she wants love but will also accept money
he wants her sort of but business must come before possible erotic satiation
together cassel and devos are strong actors carrying an unusual crime tale to its end very convincinglybr br rent it or buy it but if you enjoy a good crime story you 'll go for read my lips
and you may well want to watch it several times i dobr br 910
if you 're a fan of film noir and think they do n't make 'em like they used to here is your answer they just do n't make 'em in hollywood anymore
we must turn to the french to remember how satisfying subtle and terrific a wellmade film from that genre can be
read my lips is a wonderfully nasty little gift to the faithful from director jacques audiard featuring sharp storytelling and fine performances from emmanuelle devos and vincent casselbr br the basic plot could have been written in the 40 's dumb but appealing excon and a smart but dowdy femme fatale discover each other while living lives of bleak desperation and longing manipulate each other to meet their own ends develop complex lovehate relationship cook up criminal scheme involving heist double crosses close calls and lots of money
all action takes place in depressing seedy andor poorly lit locations
br br audiard has fashioned some modern twists of course
the femme fatale is an underappreciated office worker who happens to be nearly deaf and uses her lip reading ability to take revenge on those who marginalize her
and where you might expect steamy love scenes you discover that both characters are sexually awkward and immature
add in a bit of modern technology and music and it seems like a contemporary film but make no mistake this is old school film noir
it 's as good as any film from the genre and easily one of the best films i 've seen all year
i must admit that i had my doubts about this movie before i was going to watch it
the main reason for that is because it was compared to a hitchcock movie
i 've seen several movies that were said to be inspired by hitchcock or that could have been made by the 'master of suspense' himself but so far i have n't seen any of these movie that would be able to stand the test of time
in my opinion hitchcock has become a household name which is too easily used to promote some thrillers but on the other hand i must admit that i was intrigued by it because this is a european movie
normally it 's the big hollywood studios who like to abuse hitchcock 's name if that can raise their income
but this movie was made in one of the most chauvinistic european countries ever and i'm sure that most french would rather drop dead than to admit that their movies have been inspired by an englishman
that 's why i decided to give this movie a try and i must say that i'm glad that i didbr br sur mes lvres or read my lips as it is called in english tells the story of a young secretary named carla
she is a hardworking and loyal employee but has never been very appreciated by her colleagues
that has much to do with the fact that she suffers from a hearing deficiency which has denied her to climb up on the hierarchical ladder of the company
but when she is allowed to hire a trainee that can work for her all this is about to change
paul angeli is a 25 year old and completely unskilled exconvict
the man is a thief but carla gives him a chance and covers for him when needed
she hopes to teach him what a regular life should look like but at the same time he drags her with him in his old life br br since i still believe that the name hitchcock is used too often to describe a very good thriller which this movie definitely is i will not make any comparisons between hitchcock and jacques audiard 's directing
fact is that the man has done a really good job with this movie
i had n't heard of him before but it is true that he knows how to build up suspense and how to keep you interested from the beginning until the end
that also has a lot to do with the very fine and original story of course
i doubt if there is someone in hollywood who has ever come up with the idea of using a handicapped woman in a powerful role instead of making her the helpless subject of an abusive husband br br also worth noticing is the acting in this movie
vincent cassel is quite famous but emmanuelle devos was a complete mystery to me
there is absolutely nothing glamorous about their roles but they both did an excellent job with their characters making them feel very believable and realistic
paul could have been the average tough guy right out of jail and carla the typically helpless woman but thanks to their performances you really believe that these are two strong people who both have had some bad luck in life but who will make the best out of it togetherbr br all in all this is a powerful movie with a very fine script and some excellent acting
despite the fact that i had my doubts about it i 've soon become one of its greatest admirers
i give this movie an 810
do n't hesitate to give it a try
this was one of the dvd 's i recently bought in a set of six called frenchfilm to brush up our french before our planned holiday in beautiful provence this year
so far as well as improving our french we have considerably enhanced our appreciation of french cinemabr br what a breath of fresh air to the stale predictable unimaginative crash bang wallop drivel being churned out by hollywood
what a good example for screenplay writers actors directors and cinematographers to follow
it was so stimulating also to see two identifiable characters in the lead roles without them having to be glossy magazine cover figures
br br the other thing i liked about this film was the slow character and plot build up which kept you guessing as to how it was all going to end
is there any real good in this selfish thug who continually treats his seemingly nave benefactor with the type of contempt that an excon would display
will our sexually frustrated poor little half deaf heroine prove herself to the answer to her dreams and the situation that fate has bestowed upon her
the viewer is intrigued by these questions and the actors unravel the answers slowly and convincingly as they face events that challenge and shape their feeling towards each otherbr br once you have seen this film like me you may want to see it again
i still have to work out the director 's psychological motive for the sub plot in the role of the parole officer and some of the subtle nuances of camera work are worth a second look
the plot does ask for a little imagination when our hero is given a chance to assist our misused and overworked heroine in the office
you must also be broad minded to believe in her brilliant lip reading and how some of the action falls into place
but if you go along for the thrilling ride with this example of french cinema at its best you will come out more than satisfied
four stars out of five for me
french film directors continue to amaze with their extraordinary ability to simulate the sights and sounds of ordinary everyday suburban life
this was readily apparent with the release early in 2002 of l'emploi du temps a brilliant character study of of a white collar worker 's descent into melancholy after having been fired from his job
as is the penchant of french filmmakers many scenes were shot on real streets and in public places giving a cinema verite feel to the story yet l'emploi du temps also possessed an elegant look thanks to excellent camera work and some stunning location footage
running fairly on the heels of that masterful movie comes another impressive french production jacques audiard 's gritty crime caper sur mes levres
actually to tag this film a crime caper does it a disservice because it is so much more than that
as with the earlier french release it is an incisive character study of marginal people using their wits to get ahead in a society that has turned its back on them
in a paris construction firm carla a shy diminutive young woman sits at her desk sequestered to an area of the office that is a major pathway to the xerox machines and restroomsbr br obnoxious coworkers use the front of carla 's desk to chat and drop off their halffinished styrofoam cups of coffee
partially deaf carla turns her hearing aids on and off at will if noise becomes bothersome be it the drone of the paper copiers or the shrill crying of a friend 's baby
when her boss calls her into the office to suggest that she hire a secretarial assistant to help her with the work load carla fears she may lose her job
at the employment office carla lists the specifications she wants for her assistant as if she were at a personals agency
he should be 25 years old and clean cut with extensive computer and filing skills
when the agency sends over an unkempt menacing looking young man carla is both shocked and intrigued
they leave the office and have lunch at a local eatery where carla interviews her prospective assistant
when she finds out that he has just gotten out of prison carla initially wants nothing to do with paul but has a change of heart and hires him on
although she is basically kind toward her helper carla now finds herself in a position of authority and possessing a newfound sense of power
paul learns quickly and becomes an able worker
carla helps paul find a temporary place to live and even covers for him when his parole officer shows up one day at the office wondering why paul missed his appointment
during one of their lunch breaks carla informs paul of her hearing deficiency and reveals her ability to read lips
later when an avaricious coworker blatantly takes over a project carla has been working on a furious carla asks paul 's help in seeking revenge on the man
from here on in sur mes levres becomes an increasingly intense crime drama escalating into some of the most violently graphic scenes that have been shown on the screen in recent years
the screenplay borrows elements from hitchcock most notably rear window where carla 's lipreading talent comes into full play using a pair of binoculars
there is a teasing onagain offagain sexual attraction between the two protagonists that culminates in a rather strange homage to north by northwest but it works because of the considerable sexual heat that builds slowly between the two stars
that being said what one carries away from this movie is n't so much the similarities to classic hitchcock thrillers although those elements are definitely there but the pervasive view a of a modern day city where life runs the gamut from mundane workdays to a boozy garish nightlife where sex drugs and laundered money infiltrate the lives of several characters
unlike hollywood productions this is a psychological suspense yarn where the people look like the everyday man and woman on the street where a punch in the face or groin sounds like a sickening thud and where the office is a place to be feared
it 's hitchcock with the gloves off
one of the better kung fu movies but not quite as flawless as i had hoped given the glowing reviews
the movie starts out well enough with the jokes being visual enough that they translate the language barrier and make the nonfight dialogue sequences passable
unlike other chinese action movies which were always period pieces or cop dramas pedicab driver gives us a look at contemporary rural china
unfortunately in the latter 13 of the movie it takes a nosedive into dark melodrama tragedy which i thought was unnecessarybr br the action is overall good featuring a duel between sammo and 12 of the shaw brothers' only 2 stars karleung lau and then a fight at the end with that taller guy who always plays jet li 's bad guy
there 's only 20 minutes of combat here which is standard but what annoys me is the obvious speeding up of the camera frames
i get that they have to film half speed to avoid hurting each other but there are smooth edits and then there 's this
it really takes away from the fights when it 's this obvious the footage was messed withbr br that said if you like kung fu movies my opinion here wo n't dissuade you and if you do n't you just wasted 2 minutes of your life reading this
this is one of the best hong kong films around and it has a tense and exciting storyline as well as great fight scenes
this sammo film has it all romance drama excitement and a great hero as well
it is the only martial arts film that got me interested in the plot rather than just waiting for the fights
sammo fans this is a must see dragons forever and enter the fat dragon
this is one excellent sammo hung movie
actually this is a great piece of hong kong action cinema
the story tells the story of pedicab drivers in macao looking for love and getting mixed up w a vicious pimp
the performances are excellent and the characters are all likable and welldefined
the story is involving and has enough romance drama comedy and suspense to keep one watching between fight scenes
sammo hung proves here that he 's probably the best fight choreographer in the business
the action is simply amazing esp
the fight w lau kar leung and the finale
billy chow and sammo hung are amazing
a must see for any fan of action
what can i add that the previous comments have n't already said
this is a great film and the light sabre duel star wars tribute has to be seen to be believed
there are moments of genius throughout this movie if you can see it now
thanks again to rick baker who gave me this movie many years ago
sammo has to have a 10 out of 10 for this movie as it has everything
great story great fights great characters and great cameosbr br this film sees dick wei take on billy chow and chong fat
sammo takes on lau kar leung in a casino sammo loses the fight but what a fight it is full of high tempo action and elements of comedy thrown inbr br some great and touching moments in the film lam ching ying pops up in a cameo and gets killed off guttedbr br the end sequence will have you reaching for the rewind button as its one of the best end fights i 've seen
sammo takes on loads of guys and ends up squaring up to billy chow
sammo hung 's 1989 film pedicab driver is considered by many to be his masterpiece
i have to agree to some extent as the film in its greatest parts really gets as incredible and fantastic as any hong kong film ever has
it is a combination of pretty good and well written drama interesting and sympathetic characters some genuinely funny humor and truly overthetop hyper kung fu that is guaranteed to make many jaws drop when someone not familiar with hong kong cinema watches the film as well as it does to the experienced enthusiasts of the unique industrybr br sammo and max mok siu chung play two pedicab drivers who live in hong kong in the middle part of the last century i think
they drive their cabs and are also desperate for love
sammo is interested in local baker girl ping while max one day meets a mysterious and beautiful fennie yuen kitying he falls madly in love with
many other characters get introduced too and they remain pretty clear all the time if the viewer really concentrates on the film and its plot so i cannot say the film is confusing as it could be much worse especially in hong kong
soon we get to know for instance that a ruthless gangster family is terrorizing the neighborhood and of course their violent acts affect our protagonists too and so the premise for some of the most incredibly choreographed kung fu fight sequences has been created
as well as some nice dramabr br the film has a great cast
the leads are all very good and restrained for example and they are also thanks to the carefully written screenplay pretty likable and easy to identify with
the cast includes many familiar hk cinema faces and directors in small roles like corey yuen kwai the masterful composer lowell lo koonting the shaw veteran liu chia liang alfred cheung kinting the late great lam ching ying to name just a few
in fact the cast in pedicab driver is one of the most interesting i 've seen in any other hk productionbr br the film has some interesting peaceful moments most notably about the love affair between max mok and fennie yuen and one crisis they confront thanks to lowell lo 's character
they really could have done this a completely serious piece if they had wanted as the discussions about human values and meaning of love no matter what 's your past or what you 've done for living get so serious and genuinely effective at the middle part that the film immediately gets much more noteworthy than our average kung fu spectacle actioner
also the other characters' efforts to cure things is very touching and tells delightfully much about right human relations and friendship and of course love
still i think what fennie says to max is very unnecessary and tones the potential of the whole segment and its themes down pretty effectively unfortunatelybr br but then we get to the thing the film makers were interested the most in
which is the action the outrageous and overthetop action
the fight scenes include traditional kung fu some sticks meat cleavers and the like and they 're used here as hysterically as in the most mind blowing kung fu scene i 've seen in any film ever jackie chan 's drunken master ii they really are that great
there are wires and they 're used very cleverly and people literally fly to the opposite corner of the room when they get kicked or punched
simply amazing and again something only hong kong cinema can deliver
also the dangerous stunts make the viewer hold hisher breath as the film has one fast car vs pedicab chase sequence and various dangerous looking jumps and twisting bodies flying through the air and crushing with force to the hard destination
still the film makers seem not to accept the violence of the film as sammo is like the late bruce lee willing to give himself up after the final murderous mayhem at the gangster villa and i think this kind of morale no matter how obvious or shallow it may be is a good thing even in a harmless film like this as cinema is meant to be much more than just brainless entertainmentbr br the film has also some very witty bits of humor that i'm not sure everyone in hollywood or america would understand or like at all
the hilarious star wars gag at the beginning is definitely among these and it literally forced me to laugh when i realized what i was seeing
also some funny scenes are created out of sammo 's passion for ping
still the greatest amazementfilled laugh came during the scenes depicted in the former pharagraph as the imagery of big and tall men flying with great force over the screen to the walls or furniture is simply insane and so breathtaking i just cannot hide my feelings and thoughts about these eastern film makers when i witness something like this and this is nothing but positive and appreciating reaction of coursebr br pedicab driver is among the most incredible hong kong action films that i have ever seen and easily among sammo 's greatest achievements
if the few minor flaws were not there this could rate even brighter and higher
810
this prodigal son and eastern condors are my favourite sammo hung films
the fat dragon is fatter in this outing than he was in condors but he 's no less surefooted as director or actor
he is in fact at the top of his form and delivers a devastating brutal actioner that boasts half a dozen amazing sequences and manages to tell a compassionate sweet love story also
love and romance are not the director 's priorities here but they serve as curious adjuncts to the action and insure that viewers do n't hit the fastforward button between the physical clashesbr br the opening scene which features a funny light sabre duel sets a solid but deceptive tone
a sequence in which sammo 's pedicab is chased by a car is beautifully staged and sweetened with a sharp comic tone
the fast and furious stick fight between sammo and lau kar leung is a model of dazzling choreography and sharp superb direction and easily one of the best ever of its type
the film 's violence escalates slowly until finally when the climactic showdown comes we are subjected to some of the most brutal altercations ever seen in a sammo production
the directoractor 's assault on billy chow and a house filled with angry menacing opponents is a bonecracking physically punishing delightbr br terrific on every level and one of the best martial arts movies ever madebr br great score too
i have seen this movie
this movie is the best according today 's need
dowry in marriages is the major problem nowadays
in stating this problem this movie is the best
in this movie the indian values are stated very well
today 's youth must understand this problem
there is less population of girls
and due to this problem of dowry the girls committed suicide
if this problem continues then the day when there is no girl child is not far awayso keep in mind this statement today 's youth must understand that we can not take dowry in marriageswe have to learn from this movie that the dowry should not be takenand if we understand this problem then we can see the new trend in the society
this is the major change in the society
once in a while you come upon a movie that defines your values and shows you the true depth of human emotions leaving you drained
vivah is just that maybe more
after watching ddlj saajan and lamhey i really thought that bollywood has reached its pinnacle and will never come up with anything like that ever
boy was i wrong
i went to the store to buy some groceries and decided to pick this movie up along with the new don
after debating whether i should waste almost 3 hours on a meaningless movie i decided to watch it realizing i had nothing else to do
when i saw the rating of u instead of an a i was happy that at least it is something where i do n't have to watch scantily clad women with bad acting skills doing nothing but dancing on every opportunity they get and making out with every guy to show that they have more skills in bed than a hollywood b actress
for the first 5 minutes or so i thought i would again be subjected to meaningless story with bad acting
after all everyone who has seen shahid kapor know that he as never gained his fame as an accomplished actor
boy was i wrong about this movie
this movie grabbed my interest after the first 5 minutes and would never let it go
it was a great movie with a good storyline about the vanishing traditions of our society
i liked not only that the director was brave enough to make a movie where younger generation might not relate to the concept but also that he did it with a conviction
i have no idea why some people think that the acting was not good
i felt that the acting was great and even though the music score might not be considered the best ever it was still very very good
the good thing is this music will grow on people with time like it did with me after the i watched that movie a second time
the other good thing is that thee songs are not pushed into the script as we have all seen in so many movies
these songs actually tell a big part of the story and are certainly a welcome addition
just like ajay devgan went from being a joke to a great actor and salman found his groove after hum aapkey hain kaun this movie will help shahid kappor jump to being of the better actors and entertainers in bollywood
this is the first movie of his in which i like him and his role
he acted well and adjusted to being the nice good looking young rich kid
yes you will not find him playing basketball and scoring every point on a dunk like you saw shahrukh in ddlj he does come across as very believable as a person who holds true to his values
amrita rao for the first time came across as someone to be remembered
in all her other movies she was competing with big faces which was actually hindering her
no one knew how good of an actress she really is until they watch this movie
some of the scenes in which she has to cry especially towards the end really shows her knowledge and depth of acting
although she has been in another movies she is most memorable in this one
i think this movie will and should do wonders for her
move over rani there is finally another girl who if given a decent chance to work with good directors can grab the torch from you
she is beautiful with a great voice and has a face that exudes complete innocence
oh having almost 0 body fat does not hurt either
i thought i will never be enamored by anyone 's beauty after madhuri and early kajol but she completely changed that
shahid and amrita worked very well together and their relationship fitted their characters and they both did an excellent job
when i finished watching this movie it left me so emotionally drained that i decided to watch this movie again
yes right away
i have never ever done that
not even with ddlj but this movie just had something that had to be understood again and again
i will probably watch this movie a third time over the weekend just so i can watch and relive the traditions we all grew up with
i miss those times where families sat down and had fun
when parents had time for their kids and where kids respected what their parents believed in
i know a lot of people think that movie does not portray real life but deep down do n't we all want it to happen
the families thee tradition the love and respect
this is what this movie will remind all of us of
i can assure you it is an extremely well made movie which you will enjoy
i am sure some young people will not like this movie but if you are over 28 i doubt that you will be one of them
what can i say i have grown up watching hum saath saath hain hum aapke hain koun and maine pyar kiya
soraj have always been different
movies are part of our lives in evolutionary times soraj creates something thats hard to find
love and joint family that loving and great
vivah is journey for a couple that are getting arrange marriage that turns on arrange and love marriage
shahid has done fine work
anupamji as always brilliant
amrita rao quit different even though i felt that someway the other to me she does n't suit in that role
we 've seen her in ishk vishk and ab ke baras and main ho on na
so quit different role that she is n't in to
she is been excellent in main ho on na and ishk vishk but may be she could 've put little more in the role
anyways great going work by barjatya
this movie rejuvenates the values that we forgot
sweet film of the year
great music and lyrics
i am not sure if its a remake but anyways brilliant story that is original
soraj 's movies have been brilliant all the way so we always expect something different from him
great work by all the cast the crew and everybody
lovely family film to enjoy with your parents siblings friends and love ones
i give it 10 out of 10
one would have to be very jaded indeed not to be swept up into this gem of a film
the actors the beautiful settings locations and surroundings the deep emotions portrayed the sweet songs everything was just lovely
the human element was also woven in to create some drama and drive the plot as well as allowing a heartfelt resolution
alok nath is such a terrific actor so open with the emotions of the characters he portrays he almost steals the show from the young stars
i highly recommend this film to anyone who loves true romances ones that go beyond superficial beauty to real love as one of the best films out there hindi or otherwise
i watched this movie alongwith my complete family of nine
since my younger brother has recently got married we could connect with the goingson
the movie stands out for the classical touch given to the romance of the engaged couple
thankfully this time all indian locales like ranikhet almora etc have been used which have been already visited by most of the urbanites hence adding to the connection with movie
the dialogues are much better than those in the umrao jaan ada a supposedly dialogue based movie
the background music is augmenting the soft focus of the movie
it somehow remind me of vv chopra 's kareeb in which neha and to some extent bobby did full justice to the character
same here in that the lead pair does not disappoint in any departmentlooks or acting
the supporting cast are too good
i rate the actress playing the role of bhabhi in the front league
the situations of family interactions portrayed are real and you smile when you find yourself in place of one of the characters
songs were too suiting the scenes and going along well with the movie
however though i respect ravindra jain for his body of work from movies to ramayana i missed ram laxman badlybr br it had no double entendres no bikinis no intrigue and no nonsense
you would comfortably watch the movie with your parents except if you 're already or going to be soon engaged
i want to express on candid thing here that though suraj proposes that the marriages is between families and not only individuals his approach is totally individualistic
the movie is only about prem poonam rest of the characters are incidental
art immitating life
the peripheral characters are consigned to the background and the only protagonists are the lead pair
br br coming back everything was almost great
except for the drama part
the situation of tragedy was artificially created
the outcome the sacrifice and the ensuing heart change are not compelling at all
that is why it lacks the emotional punchthe very purpose of this turn of events
but a twist in the tale was necessary to transcend the movie from a beautiful premarital video to a 'feature film'
but i kept waiting for the punch and it never came
the preaching by mohnish bahal and later by alok nath on dowry was out of place and it made things too overboard
may be this will help the movie a taxfree status
but the plot could have been made more interesting and nonlinear than what it wasbr br there were too question in my mind when the movie ended 1 has the movie really ended
2 has the movie ended
this is one of the best bollywood movies i have seen up until now
family and friends feel the same way about it
this movie is really romantic and dramatic at the same time
in my opinion we need more films or movies like this to keep the south asian culture alive
shahid kapoor and amrita rao acted extremely well in this also their couple attracts a lot of people to the movies
this is a must see movie it 's a family and romantic movie
this movie is also from the makers of hum saath saath hain and hum apke hain kon
this movie is their best right now the setting of the movie was beautiful which also is a huge attraction
this movie is must see recommended to everyone
well vivah is quite a good but typical sooraj barjatya 's movie
it shows different aspects of indian families wedding ceremonies etc
the movie is more than good but not extremely goodbr br the big plus point of the movie is direction music and shahid and amrita 's acting
the movie starts with a common factor of indian movie a girl being disliked by her stepmother
story is the movie is a bit common but it is good good enough to make the movie a blockbusterbr br minus point is common story of bollywood movie
overall i would say it is two times must watch movie if you want to see typical indian family values and ofcourse love
i thought this movie was really really great because in india cinemas nowadays all you see is skin music and bad acting in this movie you can see some tradition ethnicity and at least some decency although some parts were a little dramatic guess what
that is what indian cinema is all about
after watching this movie at least you do n't get a headache from all the loud overrated music or any violence its just the truth it teaches about love and of course caring for the person you love throughout life i think it was an amazing movie kids can watch it without a doubt and adults will enjoy the simplicity that used to be india 's sure profoundness until all these rap hits miniskirts and skin showing became a part of it
i can honestly say i never expected this movie to be good
i do not like family films
i am far from a fan of shahid kapoor
the director 's last movie mpkdh was complete stupidity
and the music was very boring and bland
but there was amrita rao who has become my favorite after main hoon na
there was also seema biswas alok nath and anupam kher who are very talented
so a few plus pointsbr br i finally saw the movie and i was very impressed
he brings us the young lovers of mpk with a pinch of the hahk wedding and we have a winner
the story outline is similar to hahk light hearted in the beginning to serious mode at the end
the director also made character that you could relate to
the thing i did not like about hahk was that the characters were too eccentric
the casting adds to its perfection
shahid kapoor surprised me with a good performance
this is a major improvement and most importantly he suits the role
the best is easily amrita rao
in fact this is her best performance
her screen presence is so electrifying you are bound to love her performance
sameer soni amrutha prakash anupam kher alok nath and seema biswas are terrifically cast
not one actor feels out of place
br br the songs were quite disappointing but they will sound better after watching them
mujhe haq hai and do anjaane ajnabi are nice ballads
milan abhi aada adhura hai is also nice in watching
the songs are n't colorful and dancey and they are more like ballads
the exception is hamari shaadi mein which is bound to remind you of hssh and hahk
so what was the flaw in the movie
the movie gets quite slow and the ending is quite stretched
but the movie is still goes at a good pace making it a perfect family film
suraj barjatya is best in movies on marriage
and here he is back to his basics on vivaah
as the story goes this is a story from engagement to marriage
a movie you can watch with your entire family around you
a movie you will hate watching alone
the story is simple but the music is good cinematography is excellent direction is best everything about the movie has a class of its own
there are a lot of scenes which will make you cry and am sure if you are watching the movie with your sweetheart you both are definitely going to hold each others hand till the end of the moviebr br shahid amrita jodi has given us hit movies earlier like ishq vishq shikhar
though shikhar was a good movie it was n't accepted well by the publica truly shahid amrita film
i had lost faith in sooraj r barjatya after the movie main prem ki deewani hoon then a year back now i saw promos for vivah which looked good
but i did n't want to waste my hard earned money watching it in cinema
when the film first came out on dvd i rented it and watched and i loved the movie and took back my words for sooraj
i just finished watching it yesterday again and this time i thought i have to review this movie
sooraj r barjatyagot it right this time okay i was not a huge fan of hum app ke hai kaun
but i have always loved manie pyar kiya after manie pyar kiya to me i think vivah is barjatyas best work
i hardly ever cry in a movie but this movie made me feel like crying
if you have ever been in love before then there will be many moments that will touch you in this movie the movie is just too sweet and will have you falling in love with it my view a much underrated moviebr br the story of this movie you might call desi and very old times but to me it seemed modern because the two couples which are getting an arrange marriage are aware it 's an old tradition
it 's done in present times lots of people do n't believe in this arrange marriage but i do
the journey between the engagement and wedding which will always be special and this movie shows it clearly
when prem meets poonam for the first time they show it how it is and that 's reality and my parents where saying that 's how they got married and it showed it in a way which is so real yes people the way prem and poonam meet in this movie is how most marriages happen
it was a very sweet you feel nervous yet excited the song do ajnabe shows that very well
getting back to the story yes it 's a journey which you soon get glued to between prem and poonam and there families
a twist occurs in this movie which is really good the last 30mins you all will be reaching for the tissue boxbr br what makes this film so amazing is the chemistry between prem and poonam how they fall for each other is too sweet
simple boy and simple girl when they first meet during and after the song do anjane ajnabe it 's very sweet to watch she hardly says anything and prem does all the talking being honest with her about his past and the girl he liked and him smoking
then it leads on to them all having a family trip and then that 's when they really do fall for each other
it makes you just want to watch the couple and watch all the sweet moments they have
another factor is that poonam chichi is really mean to her and you feel sorry for poonam because she has been treated bad and makes you want to see her happy and when she finally finds happiness you too start feeling happy with her the movie basically makes you fall in love with poonam more then just prem
when she finds happiness through prem you want her to stay happy and also hope nothing goes wrong because the character is shown as a sweet simple girl
which brings me to performances and amrita roa as poonam is amazing in the movie her best work till date you will fall in love with this innocent character and root her on to find happiness
shahid kapoor as prem is amazing too he is poonam support in the film he is her happiness the movie together they share an amazing chemistry and i have never seen a cuter couple since srk and kajol
if ishq vishk did n't touch you to telling you how cute they are together this surely will
mujhe haq hai the song and before that is amazing chemistry they show
scenes which touched me was when prem takes poonam to his room and shows her that 's where they will be staying and he opens her up and they have a moment between them which is too sweet
again if you have ever been in love with someone that much these scenes you can defiantly connect to
the film is just the sweetest thing you will see everbr br the direction is spot on to me a good movie is basically something that can pull me in and stop me believe for this hours what is being seen here is fake and there is a camera filing them
to me this film pulled me in and for those three hours i felt really connected to the movie
the songs you will only truly like when you have seen the movie as they are songs placed in the situation after i saw the movie i been playing the songs non stop
the music is amazing the story is simply amazing too what more can i ask forbr br what i can finally say it rarely do we get a movie that makes us feel good this movie after you have seen it will make you feel really good and make you want to be a better person
its basically the sweetest journey ever its basically showing you they journey between engagement and marriage and many people say it 's the bestest part of your life well this movie actually shows you way do people actually say that
why do people actually say that the journey is just that amazing
watch this movie and you will find out why the journey is amazing
vivah is in my book the best movie of 2006
period
in my book it is one of the best 100 movies ever made in bollywood
its sad that this movie does n't have that many reviews and is n't having that much popularity
br br vivah is once again a true achievement from a director who does it again
after hahk and maine pyar kiya sooraj has once again pulled off a brilliant one vivah
br br this is the most simple and cute movies that i 've seen this year
after seeing don 2 which was crap and later dhoom 2 which even beat don in that matter i finally see a movie which is so close to my heart and my culturebr br i do n't know why bollywood is moving away from the beautiful culture which we have and are making hollywood remake style crap movies like dhoom 2 and don
br br the story is beautiful and relates much to the indian system of arranged marriage which i too would like to be a part of
our system which teaches us to obey elders follow them and of course obey their thoughts is so brilliantly shown in this movie
of course there is n't any force in choosing your life partner and it should be a brief meeting between the couple and its up to them to decide as it is brilliantly shown in this movie
br br coming back to the movie vivah is a story of journey between the beautiful period of engagement and marriage
the phase where the guy meets the girl
both understand each other both try to assess if they could love each other for seven generations and the various which occur during marriagesbr br amrita rao is brilliant in the movie shahid is ok and alok nath and anupam kher are awesome
the songs are brilliant
i especially like the hamari shaadi main hafte reh gye chaar and do anjaane ajnabi br br overall a must see for anyone who still believes in the indian culture and tradition and i certainly do br br go see this movie i just have to say one word br br bliss
this movie is a great attempt towards the revival of traditional indian values which are being replaced by western onesits a joint family story showing all the ethics every person should follow while communicating with every single relative aroundshahid kapoor gives a gr88 performance as a desi about to tie knot with amrita rao who is also very desi and she also acts pretty well the genre of the movie is the same as hahk and such movies deserve to be made in india for the revival of old traditional values the movies does n't get 10 as it is n't very good at music which counts a lot in every moviebesides this it is flawless
i ca n't believe currently this movie is rated a 69 anyway this movie was probably one of the most touching real indian movies i have ever seen
it was really refreshing to see a movie that showed traditional family cinema
as for the story i thought it was great it was about shahid kapur being set up on an arranged marriage with amrita rao
he is kind of a happy go lucky kind of guy while amrita rao is a traditional indian girl who is very helpful to her uncle but the only problem is her cousin does n't seem to get as much attention as she does so her aunt dislikes amrita with a passion
this upsets amrita because she just wants her aunt to love her
it was also very touching to see that although amrita 's family was n't that rich maybe just middle class to lower class while shahids family was quite upper class they still treated their family with respect and did n't even ask put them down which really struck a nerve with me
this is because i 've actually seen people being very rude to people who are not as well of thinking their below their standards which i feel is very shallow
this movie showed that shahids family was willing to look at the great values that amrita had been brought up with and turned a blind eye to the fact she was n't a rich business tycoons daughter or anything
all in all this movie deserved an 810 i wish more and more of these kind of movies were made
i liked this movies
its a another yash raj film which you know will look good on screen all character are always nice or very nice with one exception who you know will eventually covert to being nice another rule of yash raj 's film is that either hero or heroines have only one or none parent
think back to all of those films mpk suman did n't have mom hmapk salman did n't have parents and final rule is that you are 90 likely to see alock nath crying br br the film is good too
its a bit slow at first but keeps you entertained
there is almost no comedy but it does make you smile often enough
the little kid is well placed and deliver very good one liners
the actress is very pretty but shy you would n't get that in real life
this film does n't have massively big happy families living in big house which i thou was a good idea and allowed the film to be differentiated from other films
there will be lots of women crying at the end of the film
there is n't a strong message from this film but its a good watch
if you are married the film will remind you of what you went through
and if you are not it will inform and may be scare you br br overall a very good looking film
no big plots or twists but a very gentle film very much like bollywood classic
it is nice to see suraj barjatya back at what he is best ata story woven around a marriageit feels nice to have a movie in which there is no single scene which you would avoid watching with your family
though the story is simple and does not contain any new elementsyou still like the moviebecause of the presentation performancesand actually the over all treatment
hats off to suraj the movie is about the fact that engagement leads to love
the depiction of the changes in the way of thinkingbehaving once you get engaged is excellent
director has definitely given it much thought and actors have done it to perfectionthough the movie is slowyou do n't mind itbecause you kind of get so much involved with the story that you just wanna continue watching the joy of this newly engaged couple
as a typical rajshree stuff it has many sentimental scenes which are highly likely to make viewer burst into tears
but when you come out of the cinema hall you are very much satisfied and feel that the ticket was worth
vivah in my opinion is the best movie of 2006 coming from a director that has proved successful throughout his career
i am not too keen in romantic movies these days because i see them as old wine in a new bottle and so predictable
however i have watched this movie three times now and believe me it 's an awesome moviebr br vivah goes back to the traditional route displaying simple characters into a sensible and realistic story of the journey between engagement and marriage
the movie entertains in all manners as it can be reflected to what we do when it comes to marriage
in that sense sooraj r barjatya has done his homework well and has depicted a very realistic story into a wellmade highly entertaining moviebr br several sequences in this movie catch your interest immediately br br when shahid kapoor comes to see the bride the way he tries to look at her without making it too obvious in front of his and her family
the song 'do anjaane ajnabi' goes well with the mood of this scenebr br the first conversation between shahid and amrita when he comes to see her ie
a shy shahid not knowing exactly what to talk about but pulling of a decent conversation
also amrita 's naive nature limited eyecontact shy characteristics and answering softly to shahid 's questionsbr br the emotional breakdown of amrita and her uncle when she feeds him at shahid 's party in the form of another 's daughterinlaw rather than her uncle 's beloved niecebr br clearly the movie belongs to amrita rao all the way
the actress portrays the role of poonam with such conviction that you cannot imagine anybody else replacing her
she looks beautiful throughout the whole movie and portrays an innocent and shy traditional girl perfectlybr br shahid kapoor performs brilliantly too
he delivers a promising performance and shows that he is no less than salman khan when it comes to acting in a sooraj r barjatya film
in fact shahid and amrita make a cute onscreen couple without a shadow of doubt
other characters alok nath anupam kher mohan joshi br br on the whole vivah delivers what it promised a well made and realistic story of two families
the movie has topnotch performances excellent story and great music to suit the film as well as being directed by the fabulous sooraj r barjatya
it 's a must see
this movie brings back many memories of the classic cinema of old where actors did n't have to take their clothes off to make viewers watch their filmbr br firstly i think the main plus point of this movie is the amazing chemistry between shahid and amrita it is definitely the making of the filmbr br i have seen lots of comments regarding the film being sickly sweet and overly slushy
in response to this i think to a certain degree this is a correct analysis however considering this is a barjatya film i think that compared to mpk hahk hssh and mpkdh it has been toned down significantly
hssh was almost unbearable to watch in some placesbr br in this film however when the sentimental moments come along you find yourself smiling wishing the budding couple all the best and hoping that nothing bad happens to thembr br another major plus point is the performances of shahid and amrita
both have acted very well especially shahid who looks great in the film
amrita looks simply stunning and should be taken seriously as a future major starbr br although i really enjoyed the film as a whole i do feel that it was too long
some of the middle could have been trimmed off and it would maybe made even more of an impact
i also think the music although it fits into the film when you see the situations is slightly old fashioned and the movie could have benefited if a more uptodate soundtrack had been available
although the picturisation of the songs mujhe haq hain and hamari shaadi mein are wonderfulbr br all in all i definitely recommend this film its romantic looks stunning and has a dramatic climax
this is one of the best movies to come from bollywood in years
certainly the best this year until now
indian to the core the panoramic visuals the heartpleasing dialogs and the melodious and soft music make the movie an exceptional one
the apt depiction of indianvalues and culture makes the viewer search for hisher roots in them and invigorates the mind and spirit with a sense of pride and a new lease on lifebr br this movie is for viewers who enjoy a call to their imagination and philosophical senses
if you like watching movies to get all your nerves excited through onscreen action sex or terror then this movie is not for you because you will find that the movie is not full of 90 degrees twists in it
it is as simple a story for a movie as it can get
but that 's exactly where the art of the movie lies
one gets a real life experience and the best thing is this experience is one full of values and hope
it is about the positive side of life about the sweet things that god has showered on humans as against the regressive movies that insist on showing dons terrorists and underworlds
this is not about things and people that have gone bad
it is about the goodness that still persists and that keeps the world running
of course every genre of movies is respectable but it takes a lot of courage and talent to come up with a movie that swims against the current and tries to open the eyes of the public to the hidden realities and truths
br br having said that here 's more br br the movie is the journey of a couple from their engagement to their arranged marriage yes that 's right it is an arranged marriage and the couple come to know each other only through their parents and learn to love each other
the 6 month gap between engagement and marriage is a long time not full of enticing happenings but one that nurtures the growing love and devotion of the couple to each other
they learn together the importance of their relationship and of this invaluable period of their lives and work to strengthen the bonds of marriage
but have these been strengthened enough
their relationship will face the test of not only time but also fortune
will they pass this test
that is what vivah is about
vivah is by no means a classic
however in the days of hardcore action pathbreaking special effects complex plots its quite refreshing to see a simple film like vivah
the story as we all know is a journey from a couple 's first meeting to their eventual wedding after some coy moments and testing times
nothing more nothing less
the music is n't quite in the same league as mpk or hahk but does n't jar your senses either
two songs stood out for me mujhe haq hai do anjaane
while milan abhi aadha hamaari shaadi were hummable
shahid performs sincerely shows a lot of potential
its good to see him play something else but the cool dude he normally does
amrita is very sweet and plays the role of a docile smalltown girl to perfection
alok nath anupam kher seema biswas are terrific supports and the rest of the cast does a reasonable job
suraj 's direction is simple but effective
the movie 's prime flaw is the slow pace which might test the patience of a lot of young viewers
but all in all a good clean decent family movie
all the talent mr sooraj barjatya showed in his first 3 movies i thought were all an accident because his 4th one main prem ki diwani hoon was so bad
but i have to say it was n't an accident
this guy is talented and the way he has done vivah is just brilliant
right from the first scene it affects you
the sequences between shahid and amrita are awesome
the chemistry between these two actors gives glimpses of that between srk and kajol
as usual alok nath as the good and loving father is fantastic so is anupam kher
but its a shahidamrita filmamrita looks good in most scenes though shahid does look a little young to get married but he does a good job of a shy but yet morally strong groom
this movie will especially be liked by those who has gone through such beautiful moments in their life
all in all a brilliant film
hats off to mr sooraj barjatya
my comments for vivah its a charming idealistic love story starring shahid kapoor and amrita rao
the film takes us back to small pleasures like the bride and bridegroom 's families sleeping on the floor playing games together their friendly banter and mutual respect
vivah is about the sanctity of marriage and the importance of commitment between two individuals
yes the central romance is naively visualized
but the sneakedin romantic moments between the tobemarried couple and their stubborn resistance to modern courtship games makes you crave for the idealism
the film predictably concludes with the marriage and the groom on the wedding night tells his new bride who suffers from burn injuries come let me do your dressingbr br v i v a h showcases a lot of good things beauty of arranged marriage beauty of indian culture beauty of indian woman last but not least a nice idealism of the abouttobecouple waiting to get married playing by the rules
simple yet beautiful such a simple story no plot no villain as is the case with most of sooraj barjatya films
sooraj sir is back to what he does best
he has made the movie with full conviction
its a very sweet film which teaches the current generation a lot of good things bout arranged marriage the union of 2 families
i think amrita rao looks very good she has acted very well
she has most of the good scenes although i thought the last half hour was completely to shahid kapur who for a change gives an awesomely restrained performance
i also liked the acting of all others for ex
the choti ie
amrita prakash alok nath anupam kher shahid 's bro sisinlaw
it almost seemed as real and recognizable as it could
sooraj sir has got another nice family film to his credit after maine pyar kiya hahk hum saath saath hain
the chemistry between shahid amrita is awesomebr br stuff like sanctity in a marriagerelationship avoiding courtship mutual respect care space waiting for getting married officially prayingsacrficing for ur beloved all these and more get showcased in vivah
there 's still some good audience who r going enjoying this film
some of the folksaudience are already excited after seeing that they r thinking bout arrangedmarriage thats success if you ask me
it seems amrita rao our actressfromvivah has been bestowed the prestigious dadsaheb phalke award for 2006
hats off to her for this achievement chalo even though vivah shahid or amrita did n't get any of the filmfare other awards least this is news to cheer about
congrats to amrita rao for showing us a visual of indian bridetobe in the purest form and of course to sooraj barjatya for portraying her the best way shud n't forget shahid kapur and all others who make vivah as sweet and legendary as it is today
imagine to share the same pedestal as the legendary dilip kumar its no mean achievement
congrats to amrita rao for taking her career to another level with this award i personally feel she should keep doing movies only with shahid kapur
they make a cute couple and their onscreen chemistry reminds me of or br br some points that i observedfew of the elements if u notice carefully amrita rao looks so good because shes always wearing traditional dresses
she gives every bit of the indian woman essence in this film
perfect fit shahid kapur is like most of us not exactly ready for marriage or earlymarriage but prem listens carefully to the stepwise talk given by his dad having full faith in anupam kher
eventually honesty trust are the keywords that he reflects in his first talk with amrita
most people would think such a first meeting with a total stranger plus for a limited time is never enough to judge a person
but according to what i saw in this film i have a feeling that two people who are made for each other can connect within a 1st meet also its possible
in the entire movie there are basically 4 or 5 sequences where shahid amrita are together or shown to be together
its unlike most other romanticweddingbased movies where hero heroine are always singingdancing or nowadays doing cheap stuff
but the beauty of each of these 5 sequences characterized by restraint innocence respect for the other
i really liked the relationship shown between chacha alok nath amrita rao
these kinda movies should highlight the indifference shown to daughtersgirlkids in some parts of india
romantic scenes between lead couple are shot very nicely no cheap scenessongs are beautifully pictured
words like jalpraarthana etc
are going to be buzzwords for all girls who liked this film personally i really am fond of many dialogs in this film
last but not the least the entire hospital scene where shahid puts sindhoor to amrita when shes struggling for life is terrific
those dialogs between the couple are so touching and u feel the loveicantdowithoutu its a hatsoff feeling
br br in many ways vivah reminded me of maine pyar kiya ddlj qayamat se qayamat tak hum dil de chuke sanam for the freshnessonscreenchemistry of the lead pair if u ask me along with films like rang de basanti lage raho munnabhai dor corporate and kabul express v i v a h ranks among the best films made in 2006 in fact i think vivah does deserve better viewingbusiness than dhoom2 or fanaa or golmaal or all those timepassfuzzystylecrap movies
i watched this in july and even with the christmas theme found it touching and sensitive
it is not for someone with a realitymind as it is full of fantasy and lovely moments that sometimes do n't make sense
william russ did a grand job as hank
i have only seen him in the remake of the long hot summer where he played a weak character
but in this one the expression in his eyes throughout as hank considered the things that were happening to him was wonderful and tender
valerie bertinelli was excellent and lovely as usual and very believable in this role
and peter falk as max was splendid and always brought a smile when he appeared in a number of important scenes
there were many special scenes including the one where hank realizes who max really was in his life
it 's not for everyone especially those who are n't into 'feelgood' movies and this is definitely one
if you like everything to be perfect and make sense avoid this one
but i think it is wellworth rewatching which is why i taped it
if anyone is interested in obtaining a copy of this film please read the bottom of this description first telecast by cbs on november 30 2003 the madefortv finding john christmas is a sequel to the previous year 's a town without christmas with peter falk reprising his role as versatile guardian angel max
valerie bertinelli plays kathleen mcallister a divorced smalltown nurse whose depression over the fact that the hospital er she maintains may be forced to shut down because of a 100000 debt is briefly lifted when she spots a newspaper picture taken by photojournalist noah greeley
the picture shows an act of bravery performed by noah 's firefighter brother hank who mysteriously left town 25 years ago and has n't been seen since
hank would like to quietly slip back into town without explanation or fanfare but this proves impossible when noah 's newspaper posts a 50000 reward to identify hank known only to the public as john christmas
and there 's something very very curious about that photo it also shows a santa claus suit seemingly floating in midair without an occupant
that elusive santa is of course the angelic max who pops up now and again throughout the story in a variety of guises to solve problems dispense advice tie up loose plot strandsand even share a musical duet with kathleen 's talented daughter socorro br br interested in having a copy write to me here iamaseal2com
having been a fan of 'columbo' i was sorely disappointed in 'corky romano'
while certainly a funny movie falk 's mob boss character was a far cry from the lovable lieutenant he 's played for so many years especially with the offensive language he used
after 'corky romano' i was honestly both surprised by and soured on mr peter falk
however having just seen 'finding john christmas' and its predecessor 'a town without christmas' for the first time within a week of each other i have to say that 'max' peter 's falk 's delightful character in both movies is surely as memorable and lovable as 'columbo'
while parts of the movie are quite predictable such scenes in no way take away from the enjoyment of seeing the story played out
i too wish i had recorded both of these heartwarming christmas movies and i highly recommend them whether you 're a falk fan a christmas nut or simply someone who enjoys the occasional feelgood movie of the week
this movie may end up lost among the throngs of madefortv holiday flicks so be sure to find 'finding john christmas' before it 's too late
this cute animated short features two comic icons betty boop and henrybr br henry is the bald slightly portly boy from the comics who never speaksbr br well here he does speakbr br he wants to get a puppy from betty boop 's pet store and when he is left to mind the store some hilarious hijinks ensuebr br betty sings a song about pets henry gets in a battle with birds and a monkey but everything works out in the end
perhaps in an attempt to find another hot property for adaptation the brothers fleischer thought back to their highly successful foray into the world of the newspaper comic strip with their production of 1933 's popeye the sailor
although it was a part of the betty boop series miss b only made a brief appearance in the short leaving the rest as a pilot episode for the possible emergence of a full blown seriesbr br as is now common knowledge the gruff squinty eyed brawlin' seaman became perhaps the most successful cartoon series ever outlasting and literally outliving the fleischers and their studio lasting to this daybr br returning to king features for another try at luck was no doubt the reason for trying out the very popular henry comic strip character in a betty boop outing objective being the seeking of another series
the reasoning then surely seemed sound
henry was a most popular feature in the hearst papers' lineup appearing as both a daily and on sunday 's color comics supplement puck the comics weekly
you know what fools these mortals be
remember that one schultz
in viewing the chubby little bald boy comic strip 'hero' and his on screen antics both solo and in tandem with miss betty we were pleasantly surprised in seeing just how well the character was handled
the story and director dave fleischer both afforded a plethora of comic striplike situations and sight gags that seemed most appropriate for the character of little henry
these mostly silent vignettes were very important to the animated film in remaining faithful to the printed page as the henry feature was mostly done in a sort of 4 color 'mime'br br in the cartoon titled betty boop with henry the funniest living american we see what is basically being a one situational exercise being punctuated with the usual array of dave fleischer 's rapid fire machine gunlike gags
in short henry spots a puppy in the window of betty boop 's pet shop
it is a sort of love at first sight as henry attempts to purchase the little pup dog with the only money he had to coins in his pocket
he is in formed by miss boop that it would be 200 in depression era money to make the purchase
tears appear as the little guy leaves dejectedlybr br but a reprieve is soon on the horizon as betty asks the boy to mind the store while she leaves on urgent business
in return for his services miss betty promises him the little dog in return
of course they have a deal and betty leavesbr br getting to the work of cleaning cages and feeding the livestock affords the opportunity for the fleischer crew to fire up a whole new string of gags this time featuring bird seed henry 's bald pate and push brooms
henry 's enthusiasm for mass feeding of the store 's avian population by first literally seeding his head soon leads to a mass defection of the birds out of the store to the open street in a mass jail breakbr br betty returns to this sight and expresses her disappointment and anger with henry 's temporary custodial care
all bets were off no doggie for henry
he begins to leave dejectedly but soon convinces the proprietress to give him another shot at fixing things up
his head covered with bird seed he manages to corral all of the little feathered creatures returning them to their pet store coop
happily the little fella leaves but this time he has his own affectionate little face licking puppybr br undoubetly this was a winning combination
we have the carefree energy filled free wheeling of the boy the kindness of betty and the emotions of the situation and doubtful outcome of the 'boy and his dog' situation
max and dave fleischer had given us a sort of almost minor minimasterpiece of a surreal comedy shortbr br we were quite surprised that no henry series followed
judging by the fairly faithful treatment of the character it certainly could have been sustained for some time
at any rate this teaming was in many ways the best of the betty boop try out pictures
although the first popeye the sailor was the most successful the henry short was much better than the two following king features tryouts betty boop and the little king and betty boop and little jimmy both 1936br br poodle schnitz
at least for a half hour a week
i have n't been interested in anything on the big 3 networks in years
all of the lions are interesting although larry can get annoying at times
i really like the middle earth action figures they bring in with hunter
most of the other characters are interesting as well
the sideshow of siegfried and roy is entertaining at times too
the animation is top notch and definitely the best cg that has been done on a weekly tv show
usually when they hire big names to star in a show they 're trying to hide a poor script or characters
not entirely true in this show though there 's a couple characters that were weak and improved by the voice acting but overall the characters stand on their ownbr br this is definitely for 16 and up
there 's nothing here that most kids have n't already heard before though and most of the jokes would probably just fly right over their heads
it 's definitely not as crude and edgy as south park but does bring some of the same bash everyone feel to it
one example is that it makes fun of both dick cheney and barbara streisand at the same time in one episode
br br father of the pride and other dreamworks productions like shrek also feel like the spiritual successors of animaniacs pinky and the brain and freakazoid
it 's the same type of humor grown up
it may not be as witty as spielberg 's classic tv series but it 's still goodbr br i hope that it finishes this season off well and is renewed for future seasons
otherwise i may never find a reason to watch the big 3 again
i never saw it on tv but rented the dvd through netflix as soon as i found that it was available
i had high expectations and was not disappointed
it 's funny and the animation is excellent
that level of quality i would only have expected from feature films so i'm surprised at some of the bad comments on it
maybe the dvd release had improved animation
one bonus to the dvd is that it was fun to see both versions of the pilot
i'm an adult and i really appreciate that it is for adults
it is n't only kids who like cute animated characters
it is nowhere near raunchy as some have claimed but i can see where some parents would n't want their young children to see it
i'm very disappointed that it was cancelled
i wish they would produce more episodes
or perhaps a movie
father of the pride is a pleasant surprise it is funny witty and features some great voice acting
the show is about the family of a lion who is acting as the attraction of siegfried roy shows
indeed all of them are stereotypes but that 's what makes them so funny
fotp is not a kiddiecartoon it includes some crude adult humor but in a very mild way
it is full of popculture references and celebrity cameos and most of them are very well executed
i 'd say i 'll give the show a 7 out of ten because it is nice fairly well executed but not very original i 've seen most of those stereotypes many times before even in that particular order
one word supurrrrb
i do n't think i have see anything like this in a long time on network or cable television
watching this show was like taking a breath of fresh air amid tv schedule filled with reality shows and boring reruns
br br i have to say i had my reservations
after all critics were almost unanimous in crying foul and downgrading the show
but when half an hour was over i was left with the feeling of instant love love at first glance the true love that one feels in his guts
everything about this show screamed excellencebr br graphics in this show were at least as good as finding nemo and shrek
no small feat considering those movies took years to be developedbr br cast was marvelous
i am partial to john goodman 's voice but the rest of the team certainly were on par with john
special mention lisa kudrow 's guest appearance
she was on top of the game creating neurotic pudgy and lovable panda with a jewish streak in her
br br script was funny with a lot of inside and adult jokes which were sharp yet not tacky
a note for all parents this is not for children
this show was never advertised as such and there 's a reason why it 's set for 9pm not 8pm
so if you 'd like to complain about objectionable context save your breath
adults deserve a comedy made just for them and father of the pride is it
br br not everything was perfect
i was a bit puzzled by siegfried and roy 's characters
do i sense stereotype when it comes to them
yes they are gay
yes they are flamboyant
yes they speak with german accents
but that 's yesterday 's news
give us something new something fresh something funny
putting the old jokes in a new show is definitely the wrong approach
i understand that the creators of this show wanted to use the star power that these guys have
that 's fine by me
but please do n't dwell on something everybody already knows by heart
hopefully the rest of the show is not going to play the same old record over and over
br br in general the show is definitely a mustseetv
funny witty with a few unexpected twists here and there there have n't been a comedy this good since seinfeld
i am certainly looking forward to the next episode
i do n't know why some people criticise that show so muchbr br it is a great funny show probably not the right material for mainstream primetime but still br br the family dynamics are funny and all in all the same you see in most comedy shows
the supporting characters are absolutely hilarious
the plots of the individual episodes and the frequent siegfried roy jibes are only just above average but ever so often you have subplots or oneliners that make you roll on the floor laughingbr br this show was well worth the 8 pounds i paid for itbr br rating 810
father of the pride was another of those good shows that unfortunately do n't have a very long life
and that is pretty sad specially if you consider that almost all the time the worst shows are still on air i admit that are many similarities with this show and the simpsons but despite the similarities the show have it own merits
the animation is just adequate not incredible but is good the best are the characters
all the animals are very likable and funny and even sigfried and roy had their moments
the music was good i liked many of the songs br br even if the show is n't very original i think that this had lots of potential like mission hill a show that is n't very famous but i liked a lot this did n't have the appreciation that it deserved
what a shame
i had watched as much of the series as i could manage to watch on television but unfortunately started a job that got me working evenings
i managed to catch some recordings of it at least and of course purchased the recently released dvd of the complete series
watching the dvd you can see that the animation was a bit more crude at first but they ironed out a fair number of the flaws after the pilot was done
the voices are well suited to the characters and the writing is excellent
it 's rather refreshing to see animation getting back to it 's roots by reintroducing adult themes
thing is with the way society has come in the last century you need to be a bit more blatant about it by today 's standards in order to be recognised as an adultoriented show
the characters have very realistic personalities and are placed in situations that parallel what we often face in real life
it 's your typical sitcom in that regard but the humor is more like what you 'd expect from late night television like a talk show skit or saturday night live back when snl was actually funny
good job dreamworks
perhaps you need to work with one of the more liberal networks to keep this series going and also improve the marketing of merchandise for the series to help defray it 's high costs
it 's a challenge to do this for a cartoon of a mature nature though
hmm
father of the pride was the best new show to hit television since family guy
it was yet another masterpiece from the talented people at dreamworks animation
like the simpsons the show centers around a nuclear family
it also contains many memorable supporting characters including roger the surly orangutan vincent the italianamerican flamingo the eccentric white tigers blake and victoria the faux patriotic snout brothers and chutney the elephant
the other stars of the show are the sigfreid and roy
they are incredibly eccentric and do everything in a grandiose manner making the most mundane activities entertaining
the combination of cute animal characters with very adult dialog and controversial issues is the source of the program 's brilliancebr br the blame for this show 's failure lies with nbc
they opted to broadcast the episodes in no particular order rather than the more logical production order
several times the show was preempted for an extra halfhour of such dreck as the biggest loser
it is indeed an ill omen for the future of television as art if an original and daring show like this fails while fear factor and american idol dominatebr br luckily the complete series was released on dvd and the show now has an opportunity to gain a larger following

i'm sure that most people already know the storythe miserly ebenezer scrooge gets a visit from three spirits who highlight parts of his life in the hopes of saving his soul and changing his ways
dickens' classic story in one form or another has stood the test of time to become a beloved holiday favoritebr br while i grew up watching the 1951 version starring alastair sims and i believe that he is the definitive scrooge i have been impressed with this version which was released when i was in high school
george c scott plays a convincing and mean ebenezer scrooge and the actors playing the ghosts are rather frightening and menacing
david warner is a good bob cratchit as wellbr br this version is beautifully filmed and uses more modern filming styles which make it more palatable for my children than the 1951 black and white versionbr br this is a worthy adaptation of the story and is one that i watch almost every year at some point in the christmas season
i enjoy all the versions of this story but this one is my all time favorite
george cscott gives a depth to the scrooge character that the others do not give
the movie shows more about why he becomes so bitter
the changes in scrooge appear gradually as he encounters the different ghosts and the incidents that they show him
br br this movie has the best tiny tim by far
he is the right age rather than being played by someone who is almost a teenager as in the other films
anthony walters still has all or most of his baby teeth
br br david warner is wonderful as bob cratchit
he is such a versatile actor
he portrays a man who clearly loves his family
he plays the role with dignity neither as a wimpy man cowering under scrooges'thumb but as a man who gracefully puts up with it because he has a family to provide for
susannah york and the other actors do a fine job of bringing the characters to life
edward woodward is the best ghost of christmas present i 've ever seen
most often he is played as a jolly santa type character
in this he shows anger at scrooges attitudes and really makes scrooge reconsider
br br the costumes and the sets really bring the london of dickens time to life
a wonderful movie
ten out of ten stars br br it 's hard to believe this was a made for television movie
just the phrase made of tv makes me shudder
the production values for made for tv movies are almost always remarkably lower than production values for professional movie studios
that being said this version of the christmas carol should have been released in theaters because it is that good
it 's my personal favorite of all the christmas carol movies because every aspect of this production are of the highest quality
yes there are some minor on screen glitches with two of the ghosts that visit scrooge but there is n't a movie in existence that does n't have at least a couple of mistakesbr br scott turns in a stellar performance as scrooge he 's a pleasure to watch
in fact i ca n't think of one performance in this film that should n't be applauded
the costuming location shooting and winter backdrop are mesmerizing
the musical score is endearing and heart warming
add to that solid directing flawless cinematography and faithful scripting we have here what will one day be considered a holiday classic
it really has n't been around long enough to be a classic but mark my words one day soon it will be
this film has turned into a yearly christmas tradition in my home because it embodies the true meaning behind christmas love selflessness and giving
in as selfish greedy world my family and i can lose ourselves in the christmas carol starring george c scott
i saw this movie in sixth grade around christmas time and i was really excited about seeing it and when i heard that george c scott was in it i was really excited because i really love george c scott
when me and my class were watching this movie i was really into it and when it was over i was really impressed i thought that it was totally fabulous
this is the best version of charles dickens' classic novel that i have seen so far
george c scott 's performance as scrooge is something else i thought that he was the perfect choice he was scrooge he is the definitive scrooge
i 've seen two different versions of a christmas carol the other is the one with patrick stewart but this is the better one
br br what it really great about this is the acting i thought that the actors were fabulous everyone was the spirits tiny tim bob cratchit everyone they could not have found anyone better than the ones they had doing the parts
but the best part of the movie was george c scott
when i saw him i thought that he was the absolute best
he is the definitive ebenezer scrooge i do not think that they could have found someone better
i do n't think that they could have found anyone better to replace anyone in the movie
br br this movie is probably the definitive movie adaption of the classic by charles dickens and i really think that you will agree you will think that this movie is fabulous
i am probably going to have to buy this movie on dvd because i thought that it was totally fabulous
i totally recommend that you see this masterpiece
this is the best version of a christmas carol period
br br 1010
in our household we are enormous fans of a christmas carol and watch virtually every version each christmas including the old 1938 reginald owen and the modern 1999 patrick stewart
our overall favorite is the 1951 black white classic because alastair sim is ebeneezer scrooge and his conversion rings the truest
however this 1984 rendition has its own unique merits and makes a lovely entertaining story quite faithful generally to dickens' novel
br br first of all george c scott can certainly seem pretty crotchety and does n't make a bad scrooge
i adore his sideburns his long topcoat hat
he cuts the finest fashion figure of the lot and quite a handsome gentleman
however sometimes it seems scott is enjoying his role as scrooge just a wee bit too much and not taking it quite as seriously as he oughtbr br this rendition has the best overall christmas atmosphere hopeful and optimistic
somehow you know this story is going to have a happy ending
filmed in the town of shrewsbury england it just seems somehow very british
the film has a lovely musical score with wonderful lively caroling music throughout all the appropriate portions of the tale
sometimes i could almost smell the chestnuts roasting and the pudding singing in the copper
br br marley 's anguished ghost and the three spirits are all quite convincing
christmas past is a lovely ethereal lady christmas present wonderfully giant and jovial christmas yet to come shrouded and foreboding as always
however i found scrooge 's nephew fred a wee bit quiet grim not nearly as jolly hearty as he should be
i like the nephew 's wife whom they 've named janet with her lovely sprightly period hairstyle
instead of blind man 's bluff they 've concocted a game called similes for the nephew 's christmas dinner party which is a cute little touch scrooge getting right into the spirit of the thingbr br the cratchits and their somewhat meagre christmas dinner are well depicted with bob suitably sympathetic and longsuffering in his miles of scarf
mrs cratchit is charmingly portrayed by susannah york who also starred with george c scott in the wonderful 1970 adaptation of jane eyre
above all this version has unquestionably the best tiny tim not only an adorable endearing little waif but sickly
with those dark circles under his eyes the frail wee thing looks unlikely to survive the hourbr br this is a delightful heartwarming version of the holiday classic
with its festive atmosphere it 's sure to put you in the spirit of the season
this version of the charles dickens novel features george c scott as the scrooge
fine casting especially the choice of scott who plays the role to the hilt a fine cast supports him in the very good adaption
a modern day holiday classic on a scale of one to ten 9
everyone is surely familiar with this most famous of stories a heartless businessman is visited by the ghost of his dead partner on christmas eve and warned that if he continues in his uncaring ways then he will be doomed to an afterlife in chains
so that he can avoid his partner 's fate he is visited by three spirits who show him visions of christmases past present and yet to come so that he will hopefully see the error of his ways before it is too late
a rather morbid tale one might think but it is classic charles dickens and also one of the most famous and popular christmas stories of all timebr br to me this is the definitive version of dickens' timeless story it 's the one i always remember watching in school and i remember being absolutely terrified by it
the ghost of jacob marley the final scene with the ghost of christmas present under the bridge and the ghost of christmas yettocome especially i found very frightening
how on earth did the film gain the 'u' certificate
the two children represent ignorance and need br br criticisms for me however become apparent having watched it again with more objective and trained eyes the main one of which being that george c scott 's portrayal of scrooge seems simply not cold enough
he laughs too much
i do n't want to use the word jolly because of course ebeneezer is anything but but he does seem to be merely a grumpy old man rather than the positively unkind cold and uncaring man that he is in the book and other films
patrick stewart portrayed him excellently in one of the most recent versions filmed and michael caine despite acting alongside the muppets was positively cold
further the development of the character over the course of the film as he learns more about the error of his ways and grows towards redemption is unconvincing and appears inconsistent
he appears to have changed little by the time he reaches the third spirit 's final lessonbr br but ignoring this one quibble it is still a spellbinding and ultimately heartwarming christmas tale as all christmas films should be
london of course looks like the perfect picturesque quaint snowcovered english town that many americans probably imagine it still is and everyone is so impeccably dressed too even the poor people look rather dapper
but of course it 's a christmas film so why should n't everything look nice
perfect holiday season viewing coupled with copies of it 's a wonderful life miracle on 34th street and the snowman and you 've got everything you need
when this initially aired in 1984 my wife and i taped it on our very first vhs recorder
i still have that aging tape which i try to watch annually
it was the year my first child was born and seeing a christmas carol in this incarnation brings back fond memories of happy times many hours of which were spent with this film playing in the background
i finally broke down this year and ordered a dvd which prompted me to take a moment to write this brief reaction to the movie
charles dickens' story is captured in outstanding fashion here
george c scott is absolutely amazing and totally believable as scrooge
the supporting cast is equally spectacular
this is to my mind a flawless production
little details add much to the enjoyment
the game similes scrooge 's nephew and wife play with their party guests is a neat item
honestly i can think of few ways to entertain myself over the holidays i enjoy more than indulging in this cbs production which was originally sponsored by ibm
bottom line a christmas carol is a timeless story and this rendition is a timeless classic
enjoy and god bless us every one
although george c scott is the only actor in this version of acc without a british accent he more than makes up for it with his overthetop and largerthanlife interpretation of ebenezer scroogebr br particularly effective is when he confronts bob cratchit in his office at the movie 's end
as scott stands before a large window sunlight casts a glowing mantle over him all you can see is his silhouette
augmented by scott 's voice a ponderous growl the effect is galvanizing much like marlon brando 's first scene in apocalypse now
the horror indeed
br br however as they say the very thing that works for you can also work against you
because scott displays such gleeful ferocity throughout the movie it proves infectious
to put it another way the before scrooge is almost as charismatic as the after even though he really should n't be
it 's what you might call the doctor smith effect since jonathan harris used a very similar approach when playing that role and numerous other heavies br br actually i myself do n't consider scott 's glib rage a liability
but other christmas carol purists might
see the film and judge for yourselves
okay there are a ton of reviews here what can i possibly addbr br i will try anyway
br br the reason this is my favorite scrooge is because of everything
the sets outdoor locations costumes are so beautiful and authentic
the music is sweet
the supporting cast is very well done
one of my favorites is the narrator nephew played by roger rees
his understated sincerity is touching and his voice is the sound of christmas to me
david warner is also a totally believable bob cratchit
his is a difficult life but he remains positive and dignified
br br the best part of course is george c scott as ebenezer scrooge
some have said his portrayal too gruff
i could n't disagree more
his exchanges at the beginning while cold or harsh were n't out of character
he is a terribly disillusioned man who 's heart has been hardened by the vicissitudes of life and his own lust for wealth
br br during the flashbacks it 's obvious that he is n't all gruff
this is where we see that there is hope for him
if he was totally gone his partner marley would never have come for his sake in the first place
and after all we are none of us past hoping
i think that is a huge part of what dickens was trying to say
when scrooge looks in on his dance at his employer 's with belle you see him smile regretfully as he tells belle in the flashback that he will go through life with a grin on my face
clive donner was smart enough as the director to allow these moments on film
sometimes they get left on the editing room floorbr br and finally his conversion is so absolutely full of joy that it makes me cry tears of joy every time i see it
his apology to his nephew fred so sincere so moving it is the spirit not only of christmas but of humanity itself
the joy he brings to fred to his wife are so apparent
and the line that gets me every time god forgive me for the time i 've wasted
br br bravi tutti
ok i'm biased
i live near shrewsbury in england where this wonderful movie was filmed
it still looks the same now
i remember them filming here quite vividly and the fake snow on the streets for days on end
often when i'm walking through shrewsbury i see a street or a house and it will remind me of this filmbr br george c scott 's scrooge is a more realistic character than many of the other screen versions
his physical appearance is n't the typical miser
scott 's is big and imposing
a man who finds those smaller than himself to be inferiorbr br we all know the story and the quotes
the book is one of the most cherished works in the english language
and i do n't believe there are many cynics who would say that people are n't capable of change and redemption
this film version portrays all of that quite beautifully
george c scott may be american but he plays the part of the english miser with wonderful skillbr br i love this movie
if you have n't seen this version i would strongly urge that you do
it 's usually available for a very small amount of money or are you too mean
i first saw this version of a christmas carol when it first appeared on television
i actually anticipated seeing the film when it was advertised and it more than lived up to my expectations
i have now purchased the dvd and plan to watch it every year
with the exception of it 's a wonderful life i consider this version of a christmas carol one of the best christmas movies ever made
george c scott is excellent and a superb cast led by roger rees surrounds him
scott proves once again that he is one of finest actors of our time
scott has the artistic talent and acting ability to play any role and keep the character unique to himself
how can someone be remembered as both patton and scrooge
scott does so easily
the direction is marvelous with the fine sets costumes and music that give the movie a special feeling of the time place and era depicted
you will simply love this movie and will place it among your favorites to watch during the holiday season
this is the best film version of dicken 's classic tale
i 've seen it over and over on vhs and recently acquired the dvd version which is formatted for tv
what i find interesting about this teleplay is the cast of english actors who are now recognizable since many have appeared in other filmsshows in north america since 1984 my biggest surprise is edward woodward the equalizer as the ghost of christmas present
i saw a lot films about charles dickens' christmas carol
but this one is the best of all
there is an atmosphere which is exactly the same as in the book
the actors are great
unfortunately you ca n't often watch the film in germany and switzerland
you could stage a version of charles dickens' a christmas carol with sock puppets and i 'll probably watch it
ever since i was a child this has been one of my favorite stories
maybe it 's the idea that there is good in everyone and that therefore no one is beyond redemption that appeals to me but for whatever reason i never miss an opportunity to watch one of the many screen adaptations of this timeless classic when they 're on tv as they inevitably are this time of yearbr br what makes this version really stand out is the somber gravitas that the cast bring to their respective roles
lines we 've heard dozens of times in the past take on a whole new intensity and each character becomes more real and believable in the hands of this wonderful ensemblebr br george c scott was nominated for an emmy in 1985 for this role
it is to his everlasting credit that rather than sleepwalking through this oftportrayed role of scrooge he instead gave it a fresh interpretation that was in my opinion one of his finest performances ever
he wisely did not attempt a british accent instead delivering his lines in that famous gravelly voice
his scrooge is not merely a cranky old man but a man who harbors a profound anger against the world
as he is visited in turn by each of the three spirits we understand how this anger took root grew and ultimately strangled his soul
as he is forced to review his life we see him alternately softening and then relapsing again into unrepentant obstinacy
and in the great dramatic scene when he kneeling and weeping at his own grave begs for mercy as he attempts to convince the third spirit of his repentance and desire to alter his life we see a man who has been utterly broken and brought to his knees literally and figuratively
scott has made scrooge utterly believable and painfully humanbr br impressive as scott 's performance is the ensemble of supporting actors contributes significantly the this version 's dark beauty
fred holywell scrooge 's nephew is an excellent example of this
often portrayed as an affable buffoon here he is played by roger rees with an emotional intensity missing from earlier portrayals
when he implores scrooge i ask nothing of you
i want nothing from you
why ca n't we be friends
we see in his face not only his frustration but his pain at scrooge 's selfimposed separation from his only living relative
it is a moving performance and one of the movie 's most dramatic scenesbr br even more magnificent is the performance given by the wonderful english actor frank finlay as scrooge 's late partner jacob marley
in most versions of this tale the scene with marley tends to be a bit of a low point in the film simply because it 's difficult to portray a dead man convincingly and the results are usually just plain silly in this version it is perhaps the most riveting scene in the whole movie
marley 's entrance as the locks on scrooge 's door fly open of their own accord and the sound of chains rattling echo throughout the house is wonderfully creepy
but finlay 's marley is no ethereal spirit
he is a tortured soul inspiring both horror and pity
marley may be a ghost but his rage and regret over a life wasted on the pursuit of wealth and his despair at his realization that his sins are now beyond redress are still very human
as portrayed by finlay we have no problem believing that even the flinty scrooge would be shaken by this nightmarish apparition
finlay really steals the scene here something not easy to do when you 're opposite george c scottbr br and it just goes on and on one remarkable performance after another making it seem like you 're experiencing this story for the first time
edward woodward is by turns both jovial and menacing as the ghost of christmas present
when he delivers the famous line it may well be that in the sight of heaven you are more worthless and less fit to live than millions like this poor man 's child he is no longer a jolly santa claus surrogate but an avenging angel who gives scrooge a much needed verbal spankingbr br susannah york is a wonderfully tart tongued mrs cratchit and david warner brings marvelous depth to the long suffering bob cratchit a man who goes through life bearing the triple crosses of poverty a sick child and an insufferable boss
his face alternately shows his cheerful courage and also at times his weariness in the face of intolerable circumstances
later in the scene in which scrooge is shown by the ghost of christmas yet to come the cratchit family after the death of tiny tim warner 's performance while hardly uttering a word will move you to tears
this story is told and retold and continues to be retold in every possibly way imagine
the immortal charles dicken 's story has been recreated in every possible way imagine
i admit i have not seen the classic alistair sim version and i'm sure someday i will but i would be blown away if it touched even close to this amazing eighties version
i believe that if dickens himself had created his story for film this would be itbr br the story is well known i wo n't go into much detail because everyone has seen it in one form or another
a rich stingy mean old man is visited by the ghost of his former partner and warned about his mean ways
in order to straighten him out he is visited by three spirits each which show him a different perspective of his life and the people he is involved with past present and future
finally in seeing all this before him he realizes the error of his ways in a big way and attempts retribution for all the wrong he has donebr br george c scott is absolutely undeniably perfect for this role
he takes hold of the ebeneezer scrooge role and makes it his own and creates an incredible character
he is not just a mean old man but someone who has been effected by certain situations in his life that has made him bitter and angry at the world
there is compassion within him but he holds it below everything else and is very self involved
scott delivers the role of perfection when it comes to scroogebr br not only does the leading role make this film but everything else fits into place
this is a grand epic of victorian england dickens england is recreated before our very eyes the sights and the sounds and you can almost feel the breeze in your face and the smells of the market
director clive donner brilliantly recreates this scene and leaves nothing to the imagination
i could watch this film on mute and be dazzled by the scenery
it 's not spectacular scenery per se but it 's real
the film takes us from the high class traders market to the very dismal pits of poverty and everything in betweenbr br the rest of the cast fits into their roles and brings their literary counterparts to life
bob cratchitt played by david warner and his entire family including and especially the young tiny tim played by anthony walters were wonderful
the ghosts each had their own distinct personality and added to the dark mood of this story
a christmas carol is not a light story
dickens wrote this story for a dark period in england 's life and it 's one of the few christmas tales that is really dark almost scary and it has to be scary in order to scare a man who has been a miser for so many years into turning around
the dark feel to the story is captured in this film and is downright frightening and yet the end lifts your spirits and captures christmas miracles
the score to this film is also something to be mentioned as it is epic and grand and beautiful to listen to whether it 's the actual score or the christmas music everything fits together
apparently christmas movies are my favorite because i insist everyone see this christmas carol above all others
1010
as the celebration of christmas has evolved through the years whether one concentrates on the religious or the secular traditions it is a time when people are supposed to behave a little better to each other
that has somehow slipped past one ebenezer scrooge merchant and money lender in 19th century londonbr br as his nephew points out to his uncle he does n't keep christmas in any way because scrooge feels the whole thing is humbug
the humanity in scrooge was driven out long ago he 's a hard case a whole lot like his 20th century counterpart mr potter of bedford falls new yorkbr br but as charles dickens told this tale redemption is not too late for any of us and a lonely ghost and three spirits visit scrooge and show him howbr br a christmas carol is such a timeless holiday classic that we sometimes forget that it is as much a social commentary of 19th century great britain as oliver twist was
the characters in this film are middle and lower class
the cratchits are a couple of rungs above the street people in oliver twist but they are having to struggle to stay up there
still love and happiness radiate their home no thanks to the guy bob cratchit works for
br br like george bailey who did a whole lot of good in his life and just had to be reminded how much ebenezer scrooge needed a wake up call as to the potentiality he still had for doing some good in this old worldbr br patrick stewart in his live performances and filmed play has pretty much taken over the part of scrooge
but george c scott captures the old miser pretty well in this film
the meanness of him but with a trace of sadness that makes us root for him to change
scott joins a fine tradition of people like reginald owen and alastair sim who 've both done great interpretations of scroogebr br among the supporting roles i particularly enjoyed david warner as bob cratchit and edward woodward as a hearty and stern spirit of christmas present
br br according to imdb this is one of 32 versions of a christmas carol made that they have archived and it is one of the best
and possibly closest to the dickens story line
although i find the young ebenezer hard to watch scott does an incredible job as scrooge
his delivery of some of the lines from dickens finally brought it to life for me
edward woodward is everything we expect and more of the ghost of christmas present
i find gc
scott 's scrooge much more of a believable miser than the more current version done by patrick stewart
the scene christmas morning when scrooge realizes he has n't 'missed it' is enough to convince one that scott knows how to act versus overact
he 's phenomenal here
nearly the entire cast is incredible
the tiny tim in this version of the christmas carol is a little tough to look at almost too sweet
still the music and the scenery make this a must watch every holiday
enjoy
this is simply one of the finest renditions of dicken 's classic tale
the script very accurately follows the story originally penned by dickens and captures a perfect balance between a film atmosphere and a play atmosphere
viewers fond of either format will find enough of the story rooted in their presentation style of choicebr br george c scott brings a delightfully realistic approach to the character of scrooge and is very convincing in the character development instigated by the visits of the ghosts
i found that he was able to win me over to the point where i sympathized with the old miser something rarely done in other versions
the superb job done by the supporting actors add greatly to this production which is simply the most enjoyable of all the christmas carol versions i have seen
telefilms tend to fall under the pitfalls of a low budget and a hasty shooting schedule which is why this film always tends to buck the trendbr br george c scott embodies ebenezer scrooge perfectly fully encompassing all of his cold tendencies and still makes him a simpathetic character
the production value for this film was exceptional never relying on boffo special effects or soundstage setups yet relying on the depth and clarity of onsite shooting and strong backdrops
a movie that certainly stands alone
the setting and actors make this television movie for me the best rendition of dickens' classic tale
george c scott is very believable as is the rest of the cast
his scrooge oozes with nastiness until the very end of the movie
then his character changes to one who is truly repentant
the 19th century english town chosen for the setting creates an ambiance that is fitting to dickens and adds to the plausibility of this film
it is a movie i watch every christmas along with the real grinch and it 's a wonderful life
i know many people have a special fondness for the alistair sim version of dickens' story but for me this 1984 version is the one to beat
my wife and i own a copy of this film on vhs and we watch it together every christmas eve
i often remark that we could watch it on halloween too because it 's a very creepy ghost storybr br scotttypecast as scroogeis shudderingly mean and nasty making his transformation all the more miraculous and moving
i think it 's up there with his performance in patton
the spirits are all effective each one creepier than the last
watching the dark floating skeletal form of the spirit of christmas yet to come sends shivers down my spine every year
and what a supporting cast
david warner in particular is in top form as bob cratchit as is susannah york as his wife
br br i seem to recall that this version sticks closer to the original story than most othersbut i may be mistaken as it 's been several years since i read it
regardless this is a terrific christmas classic
so this made for tv film scores only a 76 on this site
bah
humbug
without question this 1984 version of dickens' classic tale is the best ever made
and yes the hound has seen the 1951 version which was also good but not good enough
the lack of color is perhaps the biggest shortcoming of that version although the acting was wonderfulbr br george c scott is simply incredible as ebenezer scrooge
we all know the story of this stingy businessman who is haunted by the ghost of his dead partner then by three other spirits later on that evening
scott is properly gruff as scrooge
too gruff in fact for some critics who claim he is unable to project the newfound glee that he awakens to on christmas morning after the spirits teach him a valuable lesson
but hey this is george c scott
he 's never going to go dancing down the street in a fit of joy
he has too much dignity and his scrooge projects his emotion in a realistic mannerbr br the supporting performances are uniformly excellent as are the costumes music and scenery
19th century london comes to life in clive donner 's visionary style
the film even borders on frightening in several scenes involving the spirits
the important tale of morality shines through in every frame thoughbr br you wo n't often find this version aired on television anymore and that is a disappointment
the 1984 version of a christmas carol should be a required part of every household 's celebration of the holiday
when the decorations come out of the basement this film should find its way into the dvd player at least once during the seasonbr br 10 of 10 starsbr br the hound
far richer in texture and character than even the classics from the 30 's and 50 's
george c scott was born to be scrooge just as he was born to be patton
mr scott will be known as one of the greatest actors of the 20th century
the character of scrooge as played by mr scott seemed to jump off the screen
scott as scrooge brought an richer more robust yet a more deeply moving scrooge to the screen than any of his predecessors in the role of the meanest man in 18th century london
mr scott seemed to bring scrooge to a more personal understandable yet highly conflicted level his role was acted with the great authority scott always bring to the screen yet his usual bellicose voice would sometimes be brought to a whisper almost as a soliloquy as he would berate the christmas holiday in one breath yet reveal his own human frailty in his next line
he could portray the sour and crusty scrooge and a misunderstood sympathetic scrooge all in the same scenebr br truly a remarkable performance by a giant of his generation
this 1984 version of the dickens' classic a christmas carol' directed by clive donner stars george c scott as ebenezer scrooge
by this time around the challenge for the filmmaker was to take such familiar material and make it seem fresh and new again and happily to say with this film donner not only met the challenge but surpassed any expectations anyone might have had for it
he tells the story with precision and an eye to detail and extracts performances from his actors that are nothing less than superlative especially scott
one could argue that the definitive portrayal of scrooge one of the best known characters in literary fiction ever was created by alastair sim in the 1951 film but i think with his performance here scott has now achieved that distinction
there is such a purity and honesty in his scrooge that it becomes difficult to even consider anyone else in the role once you 've seen scott do it simply put he is scrooge
and what a tribute it is to such a gifted actor to be able to take such a well known figure and make it so uniquely his own is quite miraculous
it is truly a joy to see an actor ply his trade so well to be able to make a character so real from every word he utters down to the finest expression of his face and to make it all ring so true
it 's a study in perfectionbr br the other members of the cast are splendid as well but then again they have to be in order to maintain the integrity of scott 's performance and they do
frank finlay is the ghost of jacob marley a notable turn though not as memorable perhaps as the one by alec guinness in the film scrooge'
angela pleasence is a welcome visage as the spirit of christmas past edward woodward grand and boisterous and altogether convincing as the spirit of christmas present and michael carter grim and menacing as the spirit of christmas yet to comebr br david warner hits just the right mark with his bob cratchit bringing a sincerity to the role that measures up well to the standard of quality set by scott 's scrooge and susannah york fares just as well as mrs cratchit
the real gem to be found here though is the performance of young anthony walters as tiny tim it 's heartfelt without ever becoming maudlin and simply one of the best interpretations and the most real ever presented on filmbr br the excellent supporting cast includes roger rees caroline langrishe lucy gutteridge michael gough and joanne whalley
a flawless presentation this version of a christmas carol' sets the standard against which all others must be gauged no matter how many versions you may have seen watching this one is like seeing it for the first time ever
and forever after whenever you think of scrooge the image your mind will conjure up will be that of george c scott
a thoroughly entertaining and satisfying experience this film demands a place in the annual schedule of the holiday festivities of every home
i rate this one 1010
this movie is a very realistic view of a police squad in a small german town as seen through the eyes of a woman recruit
she brings her way of dealing with the law which means more than simple convictions
the strong performance of the main character supported by good dialogues makes this flick very enjoyable
the simple hand camera both gives some almost documentary feeling to this film and also relates to the dogma filmsbr br did you ever get bored of those hollywoodstyle cop flicks with brawny guys who get assignments james bond would be envious of
fed up with the marriedlivingsingle cop the divorcedbutfamilyman the personified doughnut and the tough hunter
ever wondered how the real police work is likebr br well for germany this film shows you
set in the north between west germany and east germany former ddr an laid off post office clerk starts her job fresh from policeschool
she quickly finds her way around the usual customers and becomes accustomed to life as a policewoman but this is not much funbr br other german crime films like derrick der alte et cetera have dignified officers talking calmly with suspects
these cops here have to deal with the lowest on the social ladder
good dialogue and realism makes this an interesting view even more if you know that part of germany a bit
i would never have thought that it would be possible to make such an impressive movie without any music
but it is
just the pictures
watch out for that picture anne talking with that little boy benny 'bout the soul
really strong
might make you feel different
wow
i have seen so many bad low budget films lately but this one is great
the very realistic portrayal of police life in a city on the east german coast is a strong contrast to other crime movies or series
i loved the main actress and the absolute rejection of any prevalent clich about the police
this film is realistic like a documentation and entertaining like a drama at the same time
a perfect tradeoff
there are many police dramas doing the rounds
i am not sure why
it 's probably to do with the old basic theme of good versus evilbr br this film has a documentary style as we follow the difficult initiation of anne a raw recruit into a police squad stationed in the baltic area
no attempt is made to glamorise the police
they are truly down to earth harsh at times and unforgiving anne on the other hand has a soft heart perhaps a little more understanding of the human condition
against all rules she sometimes holds back incriminating information found on her strip searches and other investigationsbr br this is not a pleasant film
not one to relax you
there is not much feeling of optimism in it
the police seem to be involved in a losing battle
tomorrow there will be more bashings more murders more family breakups and more distressed children
let 's face it
this is the world we live inbr br as days go by anne becomes more intimately involved with the police and with the families they are investigating
the only real warmth in the film is that provided by the character benny a 12 year old from a broken family
anne has her own way of patching things up
she turns a blind eye to benny 's shoplifting and tries to help him as best she can
i was surprised though that she went so far as to seduce benny 's father
it set me wondering if it was in consideration of the father or her own needs
after all the film makes it clear that she was desperately in need of a partner and loving childrenbr br well cast but not my idea of an evening 's entertainment
this is a movie that has a lot of things that only japanese people can understand
even well translated there are some things that are obviously private jokes or regional symbolism
my guess is that it tried to send a message of some sort but that just got wasted on mebr br what i felt that is basically this is a mediocre movie with nice special effects
some kid becomes the one and in the end has almost no relevance to a yokai war that makes no sense whatsoever anyway
it would have been nice to understand what the hell they were talking about but between the azumi bean washing yokai and the one that looks like a big tongued umbrella i could n't really discern the plotbr br bottom line nice visuals the kid screams a lot the river princess is terrible cute and the rest is crap
the only reason i'm giving this a 9 is that the other kid actors who played tadashi 's tormentors were not up to the job
i presume they were just kids who happened to be the right age and handy but they were not well coached and their scenes were a minor annoyance
br br i say not to judge this by us standards because it 's full of ambiguities and the kinds of equivocations that japanese culture readily embraces and is not beholden to the blackhat whitehat moral constraints us kids' films are routinely subjected to
for example there is a preciously funny moment when tadashi 's small band of yokai companions finds themselves let down and abandoned by the other yokai and shojothe avuncular kirin heralddoes what many a stressedout japanese adult would do
hint this would not happen in a disney film
this picture also has the best product placement for beer you will ever see in a kids' movie
br br early on there 's a moment where a school teacher smacks a couple of bullies on the head with her attendance book
there was a tv commercial in japan a couple years before this movie came out
it was a stopmotion clay animation about a kid who 's depressed and playing guitar and singing the blues in his room
his mother yells at him from downstairs to shut up
then someone gives him a candy bar and he cheers up and sings a happy tune but his mother comes in and tells him to shut up again and gives him a dope slap that leaves a dent in his forehead
i mention this commercial because it was considered funny and i did n't hear any objections to it while i was there
there is a lot more bloodshed and physical cruelty on screen in the great yokai war than one would find in a disney movie
as a parent if this were a us film i would be up in arms about such things although not necessarily the moral lessons drawn at the end of the picture which of course are also not black and white
since it 's a japanese movie i accept that those cultural norms allow for imagery that would not get past the standards and practices cops in a us production
however i 'd probably be a little uneasy taking young kids to see it without giving them some sort of preshow briefing andor postshow debriefing about the violence and other off color stuff or i 'd wait till they 're older to show it to them
i just finished watching this movie and i must say that i was so impressedeverything about it was superb
the acting the characters the story
a believable child who grew into brave always willing to help others
his mum must be proud
i could not take my eyes off this film for fear of missing something
it is the prefect fabletale with morals cute and scary sprites and 'monsters' but nevertheless heartwarming folk
a child poked and bullied at school who becomes a hero
picked to be a rider at the local village festival and a journey to the goblin mountain where he discovers the yokai who are amazing creations that brian froud would be proud of
and the evil kato and his off sider who definitely needed a hug
these evil people capture the yokai and throw them into a red pit along with unwanted objects like motorbikes and other mechanical things and these meld into one horribly violent robotic monsters whose only job is to kill
takashi a young boy is the one to become their saviour alongside a red mandragon a turtle man and a river princess as well as a cute little creature that if it had been america they could have turned it into a cuddly toy and sold it at all good toy stores
the lines are good especially the do n't try this at home kids and other gems that bring a smile to your lips
suspend belief and watch this with a child or on your own and enjoy
though i must admit that the end was a wee bit sad
and not necessarily so
cheers furdion
takashi miike is one of my favorite directors and i was worried about him doing a kids film because i would hate to see him depart from his films i came to love visitor q gozu izo ichi the killer and black socioty trilogy
lately he seems to be exploring new territory and i think he 's succeeding
still this was the first of his films i 'd seen him take that direction so i was nervous
of coarse i bought it without seeing it and was glad i didbr br great yokai war is a perfect kids film and adults should like it too
the whole film reminded me so much of the movies i loved as a child neverending story labyrinth return to oz etc
i enjoyed those films because they did n't treat kids like they 're stupid and this one does n't either
the dark underlying morals are there but it 's also as silly as any kids film should be
i personally was n't bothered by the cgi and prosthetics
i feel like they fit well and do n't think kids will noticebr br if you are a die hard takashi miike fan you may not like this one
but i suggest giving it a shot
it proves that miike is as diverse and talented as i suspected he is
he also continues to make his signature miike films outside of these ones which is very reassuringbr br to those people that are new to takashi miike and want something light hearted or dramatic like this one i suggest these other miike films 'zebraman' 'the happiness of the katakuris' 'sabu' and 'the bird people in china'
br br good job takashi miike
810 stars
yokai daisenso is a children 's film by takashi miike but as you might expect it 's probably a bit too dark scary for younger ones
however older children may well eat this up that is if you play it dubbed in englishbr br the story is that of a young boy who has moved with his mother to the country to live with his grandfather after a divorce
during a village festival the boy is chosen as a kirin rider a great honor but with that honor comes much danger and adventure of coursebr br meanwhile evil doings are at hand as a woman in a white mini skirt gogo boots a beehive hairdo teams up with an evil yokai to turn people 's resentments and discarded items against them
and this evil has manifested itself as a flying city in the form of a monster that heads for the city of rage itself tokyo
one quite funny scene has two derelicts watching the monster fly over the city says one oh it 's only gamera
br br the young boy has befriended yokai which are monsters of a kind mostly benign that have isolated themselves away from humans and all the yokai in japan band together to fight the evilbr br in many ways miike crew have taken the late 60 'searly 70 's yokai films and turned them into a modern action adventure film for kids that also combines some strange mechanical monsters that made me think of transformers
the look and feel of the film is great the effects are entertaining and some of the humor will just sail right over kid 's heads but still older ones might enjoy it
as for adults there 's not much here not to like if you 're a fan of japanese monster movies you 'll enjoy the heck out of thisbr br cool fun stuff kind of dark at times but perhaps that 's just miike and what a wild ride
8 out of 10
yokai monsters spook warfare a movie about yokai or traditional japanese monsters of folklore
it is alternatively known as big monster war or as ghosts on paradebr br the yokai of the first installment include the teapot freak kappa water imp a living 'brella a woman whose sheeks can grow extremely gigantic a woman with a second face on the back of her head a dwarf priest with an enormous gourdlike wrist so onbr br these sorts of whimsical monsters derive not only from fairy lore but from a type of summer entertainment of the tokugawa era comparable to today 's halloween haunted houses or the freak shows of yesteryear but with exclusively phony freaks
ghosts goldfish monsters dancing oneheaded umbrellas were trumped up to create chills during the hot summers
the fatcheek woman such were recreated by tricks or illusions based on monsters depicted in medieval scrolls if their design for the movie is a bit simple hoky this makes them all the more representative of what historically was recreated for summer chillsbr br these rather endearing monsters have to face off destroy an ancient babylonian vampire demon who has come to japan disguised himself as a samurai lord
despite that some of the japanese apparitions are a bit goofy too many of the costumes scarsely more than masks without even moving lips as they speak it is all played very pokerfaced is very charming
it has some beautiful cinematography much as would be provided in a cgi film of the same decade
viewed in the right mood or with the right friends it is exciting moving touchingbr br yoshiyuki kuroda also directed the famed lone wolf cub white heaven hell and was the special fx director for the excellent daimajin trilogy
the yokai monsters series is not the equal of majin at its best but the yokai are nevertheless great fun
the first miike movie which is the most childoriented of his family films with the gozu izoo consecutively more serious though none too severe for young viewers
2005 toronto film festival report it is official takashi miike is whackedbr br the annual midnight screening of the new takashi miike film the big spook war or the great yokai war or ykai daisens
call it what you will this is a fanatical ridebr br colin geddes the fearless programmer stated this film was originally geared towards children in japan
think of lord of the rings or neverending story for japan
after the screening i can understand where they were going with that but damn this is takashi miike after all
he directed the '01 film ichi the killer when it screening at the festival barf bags were handed out at the screening
and no that was n't just a marketing ploybr br plot summary a young boy with a troubled home life becomes chosen and he stumbles into the middle of a great spirit war where he meets a group of friendly spirits who become his companions through his journeybr br this is not really for kids well not 'too' young
certainly see them getting scared shitless with some of these spirits on display
this is unlike anything i 've seen in the movie theater before
a fantasy naturally some very funny material
you will not be bored can guarantee that
will this ever hit north america
doubtfulbr br my rating b
what a strangely wonderful if sometimes slight and bulky bigbudget fantasy this is
takashi miike had already proved by the time he got to the great yokhai war that he could dip into other films aside from his supposed niche of the crimeyakuza genre
but here miike in his first and only coscreen writing credit no less proves that he can deliver the goods on a postmodern soup of mythical fantasy conventions and with it boatload of cgi creatureeffects and makeup and an epic battle that is more like a festival than something out of lord of the rings
the comparisons can be made far and wide to be sure and the most obvious to jump on would be miyazaki for the seemingly unique mixture of kidsasbigheroes powerhungry sorcerers looking for the energy of the earth as the main source machinery as the greatest evil and many bizarrely defined flamboyantly designed creatures
but there can also be comparisons made to star wars especially to the gungan battle in tpm and to the whole powerplay between good and evil with similar forces
or to anime like samurai 7 or of course to henson 's films
and through all of these comparisons and even through the flaws or overreaching moments it 's miike all the way with the sensibilities of effects and characters
