occasionally it works if only for the actors lena nyman and borje ahlstedt but some 40 years later its hard to completely connect with everything that happens in the innerfilm of lena and borje since sjoman fills it up with clichs and a heavyhanded narration from his starlet of sortsbr br and yet for whatever faults sjoman may have ironically considering he means it to be a comment on itself i am curious holds up beautifully as an artistic experiment in testing the waters of what could be done in swedish cinema or testing what could n't be and bending it for provocative and comedic usage,0

the direction and cinematography were engaging without becoming a distraction,0
with all the slow motion going on i couldn't care less about the characters,1

it is spectacular and full of classic villain bios the programme furthermore has a quirky silly magiccomplex a light hearted and rather deferential script also the hopelessly luminous archie bishop actor of years was quoted as saying while in truth his comedy is more comedic than comedic in ultimately the film is deeply charming very bright comic in quality and a cult classic,1
