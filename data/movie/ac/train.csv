interesting realistic characters and plots as well as beautiful scenery,0
imagine yourself with three decent characters dressed like girls all of which have old quirks and a finesse that doesn't fall waiting for one to pull a gun on them,1
even though kate and incessantly respond to her behaviour in a counterculture manner no one has ever really shown a hint that the duo is really in love,1

period,1
basically this is a story about a car breaking the trend that has kept every car an early vehicle for smart title throw away situations with employed people having sex and finally retirement,1
instead the director tries to make this scenario harder to accomplish but unfortunately this does nothing to intensify the characters generically speakingbr br overall zahn'summing up remains the same since it seems too fastpaced in its portrayal of the various various phases of sports success and development,1
may be this will help the movie a taxfree status,0

while the injured girl learns a deep meaningful truth on her once sheltered life and the outside world alisha learns that complete abandonment of society and locking everything inside is not always the best thingbr br many people will look to the connection between these two girls and see one of two things,0

the great and underrated marion davies shows her stuff in this late silent comedy that also showcases the wonderful william haines,0

the whole concept was very slow burning i think with boots trying to cover up and blindly trusting other people 'til the very end they all give up at the very last momentbr br one other issue of the game it has definitely had possibly the worst sound i ever heard van swords voice for the first game in motion capture right,1
one thing women look for is well which is those close to them in life most learn each day,1
the movies portray scene after scene of homicide and crimes that occur in the area,1

so this one goes because amir was pretty done in the film that changed the script way too much he may not have played war brothers better for me i wish they had have vanished right away i pray for the all american fans out there who waited to rent movies from david mamet that should only be missed in our culture 'todaybr br also note that thru his characteristic fantasy they are making me smilehe doesn't drink or use drugs but falls way over backwards to get us to believe she does love him,1
the entire cast came into the movie with their clothes on,1
no this character is much more complicated than the rest of themand the plot in general is very hard to followbr br every character involved walking through the maze becomes a fight chore not only because it puts to shame young or old watchers but because they are bored out of their minds and thinking unless they're wrapped up in some kind of connection with themselveseither because they've been learning self esteem self trust or because they repent of their complicity in the darkness of the mazebr br if pvtaly '68 was still in circulation it would have been worthy of this outingbr br hal jack is not a good loner flattered gentle,1

some of us fell asleep from tracking down the wife and child amongst all of the neon row and didn't even reach the second floor of the restaurant,1
the director kudo tries hard at showing good acting through a phallic shower and some truly sympathetic characters but must have seen enough to know remains an outrageous scene almost worship made '84 this movie is bad for anybody but lowbrow movie fans and the general public,1
antheil seems to have originated 'the big sound' adopted by all subsequent westerns whereby the plains sing out with the voices and sounds of countless cowboys in the sky celebrating the open spaces and interweaving common melodies,0

she runs across ned givens who owns a coffee shop in galvestonbr br with a high school teaching staff and a comprehensive collection of tapes now rather than 35 years old there keep churning out a surprisingly appropriate invocation from this writerbr br this is quite brilliant work on two levelsbr br firstly the story doesn't feel amateur either and i'm sure it wasn't intended as a comedy there is nothing amateur about it,1
what a script,0
but ronda clearly has close dealings with corrupt sheriff gannon and engages in some shady practices in her castle saloon in skagway,0
after that scene everything went southbr br the way the original premise of getting the psychic to help the naked industrialist is spiced up to fit the whole stupid mediocre premise,1
although i 've long been a fan of peter weir i had n't watched any of his australian movies until i watched the last wave,0
the three witness the disturbing double death or their friends before they are teenagers and subsequently bury the emotions they feel with their peers frail corpses until they meet again once more at a hospital for those suffering form tuberculosisbr br the cinematic style of the text is typically visually opulent as you would expect from the spanish auteur and is extremely reminiscent of fellow spaniard pedro almodovar 's work with themes dealing with sexual desire both heterosexual and homosexual,0
unfortunately those americans came with some preconceived notions about liberty that just had n't made it that far south at least liberty for white people,0
but all in all a excellent movie,0
the writers and directors are supposed to put their own spin into the story,0
there are elements of coensan and a few black aspects of how bad the film was but even the few things that are sometimes controversial on the subject of race violence are handled well,1
undying is a very good game which brings some new elements on the tired genre of first person shoot em ups,0
and of course this movie had some pretty graphic oneliners too we all know i'm meant to think negative,1
robert demme mentions the philosophy of heat and too much heat means that he can't heat her up so he creates every witless clich that tanked after equation,1

again there are three words out of the title a groom 'twist,1
you should definitely watch this before you watch scream or i know again,0
apparently trier assigns the nazis' werewolf terroristgroup too much historical significance,0
the lack of buildup while bizarre is understandable given the power the players and cast have to play,1
they did this by pulling a dead end gangstas and gangsterhedirectors slap a lot of sticks on our faces to get us into the realms we're in,1
the way this movie is written you see yourself becoming wrapped up in the story and asking yourself what you really believe from all different aspects,0
there 's an episode on their love livesjobs etc,0
although it never got the pictures attention of the movie they considered it highly controversialbr br paramount,1
these quibbles apart however the film is a dream,0
br br the best part of course is george c scott as ebenezer scrooge,0
this film had all the characteristics of great films but it did not have a good story and scenes looked as though they were left on the shelf under ridiculous conditions it doesn't capture real life life,1
the budget seemed ridiculous as if somebody wanted to place some neopal varna in a stadium that is supposed to be full of pads and posteriors,1
it never does,0
also i never liked matthau,0
first i will make sure to mention that this is not funny because it claims to be a 'feudsianpeppermint cheerup contest by santa loves clive barker camp that takes place at nancy 'at night ',1
the writingbr br i read through the commentary on the dvd though regarding the way linus're relationship with angel comes through in the movie,1

the three leads have the best chemistry the big screen has offered in recent years and it looks like they had a great time making this film together,0
the grandfather was one of the young men who searched for the sunken uboat shortly after german bodies started floating ashore back in 1945 no submarine was ever foundbr br what to expectbr br key elements are nazi experiments nazi history treasure hunting secrecy competition teen love conspiracy and a surprisebr br warning spoiler br br i had not expected some elements of the supernatural to appear in this movie and it caught me off guard,0
ok so the musical pieces were poorly written and generally poorly sung,0
it is yet another torture to watch,1
right from the first scene it affects you,0
the title that miller uses,1
most of the ensemble members appeared to have no idea of what they were making,1
when i saw the episode in which a student repeatedly tried to burn down the school i immediately recalled at high,0
one feels such a part of this family,0
in search of something that will prove his love to victoria,0
part of why the director did so many exercises with both scripts is that in this case ratso is the healer follower that boone is the little megalomaniac who seems to be just a caricature of boone,1
but it seems a mistake was made in heavenhe should have died,0
however midway through the very successful show the police come and shut him down,0
and the classic lady katie situation is somehow also responsible to this film,1
again the electrical work is very impressive and the script clearly gives reference to the writing style and most of the scenes are filmed in very high quality,1
maybe they should have stuck to homer '99br br beavis and butthead kent wrote this completely unbelievable script and canceled that terribly useful chronicle of his growth up there on the faces of the wilder bet and the miserableoo,1
it is basically the other way round just a fun combination of two hilarious and notorious comedies,1
it 's hard for me to criticize anything that mitzi kapture does,0
other than being laughably bad i thought that you get better popicles and that your growing to love and care for them,1
br br like george bailey who did a whole lot of good in his life and just had to be reminded how much ebenezer scrooge needed a wake up call as to the potentiality he still had for doing some good in this old worldbr br patrick stewart in his live performances and filmed play has pretty much taken over the part of scrooge,0

the story is first and foremost about atiny island liesutenant juan an elite marine officer who lives in guaiacabire of other popular animals,1
he just had a path to live along,1
otherwise this film is a definite mff horrors novel that many will most certainly not buy a copy of and will probably continue to make in my book for the next 2 decades,1
the acting is excellent and the script is quite well written,0
if the movie was only made for these things it was good enough to watch,0
valentine is the second industrial movie of the director jamie blanks after his urban legends,0
the camera angles were slick and well done,1

lando an interesting character introduced in empire here is stuck as the ostensible person we care about in the giant space battle,0
not sure what i am talking aboutbr br the movie simply stands there with nothing to show what they had in the shape of stocks in other states,1

if you ever want to see what a movie can do watch this,0
an average brit with a hopeless routine,1

in flamenco more than any of saura 's other musical films it 's the rapt intense interaction of singers and dancers and rhythmically clapping participant observers shouting impulsive ol 's that is the story and creates the magic,0

one aspect i liked especially is the idea of the antagonistluzhini 's exmentor working his evil on the sidelines,0
so many beautiful movie stars have been accused of sexual harassing but other than that they were just walking along,1
the other characters deep down are wooden and only give good lines,1
it i think is where the film 's subtle sidestepping impact finally begins to seep,0
classic american movies are faithful to serial killers or crimes in the same genre as max and jurassic park the first ii the b bathroom and doc but it was pretty before the texas chainsaw massacre and ames jet li or even pokemon,1
it 's difficult to believe this was made in 1946 as the tale is still fresh today and really makes one think,0
already set in the middle of a major disaster the film captivates with tragic moments of wild gore and the ominous music of the haunting spoli turns those nocturnal moments in life into some sort of cinematic delight,1
so far i have only seen 3 movies the cinematic equivalent of arrest the personalities which can be measured by their fight scenes are somewhat more set in the chinese cemeterybr br the torture scenes are very outdated camerawork is decent but the actors are unconciousbr br for nitpicking a 2star production ben duquette deserves about 25 star,1
so watch it and decide for yourself,0
the characters were however engaging an odd one at that,1
we cheer on lando and the other pilots as they take on the mighty imperial fleet and risk life and limb to fly into the deatn star to destroy it once and for all,0
playing a very difficult character and acting in a language he did n't speak and still handing in such a strong performance,0
he seems embarrassed by this there are too many opportunities wasted,1

katherine heigl marley shelton denise richards david boreanaz,0
that level of quality i would only have expected from feature films so i'm surprised at some of the bad comments on it,0
one thing that is fairly disappointing is that they portray such a gloomy picture of the equality between men and women in the future when they paint a very positive picture about everything else,0
her lack of comedy ability is at odds with her imagination but this film is a workof art,1

hello to you dilettantesbr br even though hollywood is trying to ruin this classic film it is made linear which greatly hinders the enjoyable viewing experience,1
those that can't believe it don't recognize it nonethelessbr br i personally found this movie to a rather good disappointment,1
just another sick tv show stinking up the back of your brain,1
this movie is so complex that it can be given any description and still roll with it,0
nowadays the series is so low budget and so flat a film deserves special mention for being not to trivialized by rockford,1
stealing the frame is much more interesting in its own right than handling the situation from the viewpoint of the main protagonist finding these bizarre things and stating exactly what he perceives,1
he delivers a promising performance and shows that he is no less than salman khan when it comes to acting in a sooraj r barjatya film,0
if you really want to know what it 's about go buy the book,0

horrible qualitybr br considering that you're dealing with two teenagers who physically and emotionally mature enough not to have drugs talk about money happiness etc just because the computer dies on you never means the suicide,1
there were many special scenes including the one where hank realizes who max really was in his life,0

bottom line excellent movie for everyone,0
all the story lines are so good,0
the whole thing displayed good pacing and plot fit into a class usually reserved for film but the story was dull at best br br sadly the film was eclipsed by utterly laughable rape scenesbr br preston and his friends wait for waltweiser to come but all they see is one great old truck filled with bloodbr br and apparently in 1918 they made five hundred blood to buy for only a little less and by the time this movie broke the fourth wall the fourth wall was over the present,1
it is an intriguing drama as well in a completely different waybr br all of the actors swearend have been friends and movies with them,1
'offon' captures grainy fragmented images presenting life from the warped perspective of a computer processing too much information,0
charlie cox as the protagonist tristan captures the correct mixture of naivety subtle comedy and selfrealisation required for a story like this where a humble young boy embarks on lifechanging quest claire danes as yvaine is beautiful feisty and just ever so slightly alien or ethereal a perfect interpretation of her stellar role robert de niro in the cameo every reviewer is talking about is indeed deserving of praise rollicking good fun and michelle pfeiffer is triumphantly cool and nasty as wicked witch lamia my favourite performance of the film overall,0
if you prefer to rely more heavily on your native world you can do so much worse about your filmsbr br fantasy world of the dead is so bad,1
imdb lists the film as a 1972 release but both the national film registry and the national film preservation foundation give 1968 as the correct year,0
the story is just as dark and frightening as any other that even mentioned that one scene with mikkelsen in the past,1

ferrell hands over the keys to franco in return of the viper but doesn't report the deed until five days after it was mentioned that the chickens died of drugs some 43 years after insisting he was a bad manbr br the title sequence is outstanding in the center of the plot it shows them trudging through the woods and carrying torches in a july worsleoire sized outing and a prayer fires are blazing in the colors of palm vinegar when verrets stops a thief by fleeing br br if you look closely you may get the feeling that maybe your attention spans big with chauvinism maybe the fact that,1
the delivery of some very humorous rude lines by pierce brosnan is alone worth the price of admission,0
he 'll bloom normally but is a few months old,1
br br overall the ending was slow and cliched,1
why not,1
most disappointing is the end,0
however there is no proper sound commentary or proper lighting for the evening,1
it 'll blow you away,1
but imdb users have collectively and very emphatically demonstrated that none of these are necessary for a film to prove highly rewarding to watch and if you care to give it a try you may as i did come to rank it among your much loved filmsbr br it is fairly rare for me to watch a film of a book with which i am already familiar,0
on the same day seven young men are converting white catholic priests in jammed '72 a murderously bloody massacre that the catholics vowed never to commit again a reign of terror that has killed over ten million forced state funerals the biggest murder of the last 10 years in a sequence of events that i have not seen in years,1

and jack cardiff 's cinematography is reason enough to watch the film alone the way he lights kim hunter 's face makes her all the more beautiful what a genius he can make a simple things such as a game of table tennis look exciting,0
it 's chock full of riotous sight gags teenage spirit and bizarre offthewall moments,0
the performances were top notch with jane zellweger making the finest loko lopes show of her role as a vulnerable woman needing medical attention who invents another girl going to great lengths to get rich etc,1
the reason that this film is so overlong is that the characters are extremely thin and there isn't enough introduction to anything that the film lacks,1
the dialogue is loud and cold as the air constantly deflected from authors to authors and pacing is slow,1
you will not be disappointed,1
although i can't give 4 stars outright because i notice it'ssometimes feels so much better to go by my personal hygiene rules than to sit down and watch this unwatched mess,1
they could film some uninteresting porn scenes only with in depth clues,1

victor garber james pinkins taylor holland and the rest of the cast play as an ensemblebr br the film has an intensity because it 's not explicit in showing how the shootings occurred which helps the tone that mr ryan wanted to give this movie,0

this displays that he might just care for one person his sidekick ben tatum played by walter brennan since tatum is the one that gave it to him,0

the acting was outstanding of course but it 'll take a trained eye to sway me into seeing something truly commercialbr br this is my favourite animated movie yet very tedious,1
and they are the details of the story that are best discovered by reading the different viewpoints given by the various historiansbr br this movie was always going to have a hard time having make a compromise of appealing to a global movie market and the legend as it means to australians perhaps a little of ned 's spirit is in this movie because i think it rebelled against people 's expectations and unfortunately missed both targets,0

angela pleasence is a welcome visage as the spirit of christmas past edward woodward grand and boisterous and altogether convincing as the spirit of christmas present and michael carter grim and menacing as the spirit of christmas yet to comebr br david warner hits just the right mark with his bob cratchit bringing a sincerity to the role that measures up well to the standard of quality set by scott 's scrooge and susannah york fares just as well as mrs cratchit,0
one of my favorites is petulantly something whereby the doctor hams it up like a fifties flick as mad scientist scorsese put an entire group of people on board to study worldly phenomena and discover fault,1

that 'll probably give you the pause to figure on 'who has it coming for ya,1
it is usually ban absans and monkeys with all their busted up characters shadow kardashians lowly vengeful caucasians or even meizards in porn,1
it is a sentimental story that communicates a situation much like the prologue in my book enabling the human characters to grow and develop,1
this movie shows that great storytellers try to do their own thing without copying medium genre favorites like hitchcock 'old time magic movies and max von sychner'modern time fantasybased scifi horror films but thankfully they succeed in doing that,1
yeah the stuff about craig and shiiiiiiiight yeah,1
all the dialogue and character interaction that occurs within it comes out of the long winddown of a late southern day,0
very good luck for the ramones who were looking to break out of the underground punk rock world and into the mainstream market,0
fortunately it made for an enjoyable quirk of a film,0

deanna seems naive and with plain thoughts no complexity inside of her mind,0
my vote is threebr br title lock for michael liarplay in bournemouth,1
up until recently they were dispensing the stuff like candy and only now do they even begin to understand what long term effects the drugs have,0
the show never some late show runner more like nor can this show of some human beings run in the wind i don't want to see so many filmys at such a show sometimes i'm just unhappy sad crying times laughing times how i did enjoy this moment the highlights 1 and 10 oge me,1
and unlike the teen sex comedies that overshadowed it the movie holds up well against timebr br its theme of teen angst is as relevant today as it was 25 years ago and jodie foster and sk8er boi scott baio lead a fine young cast that 's well worth watchingbr br the film follows four southern california girls as they move through a rootless existence of sex and drugs and devoid of parents,0
i mention lucy primarily because davies' mannerisms and facial expressions reminded me of her to the point that i wonder if davies was n't one of ball 's primary influences,0
the only real warmth in the film is that provided by the character benny a 12 year old from a broken family,0
't just the aspect of women who confront wrinkles with diet pills is sound idea,1
it is true that a giraffic wedding there is very much of symbolism with the great catherine but that does not at all indicate the fictional wedding sequence,1
while this is happening tom roberts is totally love struck over riff but riff 's friend kate rambeau feels the same way about tom,0
eddie murphy really is very good as marylette dennis,1
perhaps he has bullies stiff humor issues and his obsession with one ladies brother who will not approve his behaviour,1
the actors are fantasticparticularly kiefer sutherland who plays the bad guy and his wife are gorgeous as alwaysbr br the photography of gabrad malik mikael kovelev who allows the still shots to stay excitingthere are a lot of closeups and the two danish soldiers that had bigger wounds and bruises are impressive as well as a lot of fighting scenes always with gratuitous battles or with people fighting side by side with gabrad,1
well crafted and delivered the luzhin defence' is an emotionally involving film presented with a restrained compassion that evokes a sense of sorrow and perhaps a reflection upon man 's inhumanity to man,0
still the fun consists mostly of scenes that seem incidental to the storyline but in the end just stay together and nothing is wasted,1
don't even ask about your sister 'cause she looks so wonderful in this movie,1
the acting sucks terribly with the scenes where oliver comes in and is frankly irritated at every single thing that happened without his realizing it,1
the music was good i liked many of the songs br br even if the show is n't very original i think that this had lots of potential like mission hill a show that is n't very famous but i liked a lot this did n't have the appreciation that it deserved,0
she wants love but will also accept money,0
however i find that coming on to the ending it could have been a little longer to me it seemed like it was rushed a bit as if the writer was trying to take linens off the lines before the rain fell,0
br br it 'll fit into the style of a horror movie like prison break and it 'll have more gore and feverish stunts than a movie where the gore and swamp scenes are shown over and over in one complete celluloid sequence,1
but who cares if the wideshot was filmed badly or if you could see a mic hanging above somebody,0
but she had the right amount of melodrama and snide comments throughout the movie,0
she drives an old clunker and rents a tiny room from a gay male couple,0
there 'll be too little of that here,1
i liked this movie because it told a very interesting story about living in a totally different world at the south pole,0
all sorts of portents and omens soon pop up as the man 's death involves a tribal issue that was not meant for white man 's court and pretty soon the lawyer is having trouble distinguishing reality from fantasy,0
i also thought there were some slow moments so some of the mystery felt padded,0
even more hazardous than scaring the living daylights out of them is the overlypresented monstrous mutants that populate the three giant beasties,1
the point of a film about a girl in a deep depression is that she suffers from extreme emotional pain and dreams about someone who is incapable of providing for herself and to her hopes and dreams,1
this movie should be renewed to its significant and groundbreaking potential,1
its like as if somebody decided to put on one crappydoo skit or funnier skit at a bar just for its special appeal,1
for example when a gas main exploded in the police hq of bombedout bremen or when the soviet military commander died in a motorbike accident in berlin,0
goldie surpasses other actresses as she has maintained a screen persona ventures in projects other wo n't,0
that 'll certainly be millions of people reading this review but i think we know what some of them will be thinking when the real truth comes outbr br what the movie does not really know only involves george hung as goldeneye 'cult alpha seeking scum looking for reputed boffins at the zoo called alligator island,1
the action is great and bizarro detective stuff happens and just something really good is thrown into the mix,1

carlyanna was young yet her winning career mirrored the odyssey she went through at the gate,1
but no matter,1

college kids should be wary of bonkers,1

shirley jones takes a break from rodgers and hammerstein and gets a few opportunities to grace us with her singing talents,0
i mean the actors the story the pictures the efx everything was where it should be,0
instead it 'll make corny jokes to make you laugh but thats not the way it 'll be carried outbr br all the songs are in fact a little too forgettable just plain annoying,1
it 'll give you a restful runbr br all in all it leaves you with a significant understanding of what drew cohen did put in his art,1
so don't bother,1
bassan 'richesugar forgot a way to stare straight at the camera and step out the window but decided to take a deep breath,1
nothing more nothing less,0
very enjoyable film,0
it did n't try to pound a lesson into us,0
again i am not going to be picky about these small matters,0
although i often missed juvenile acts such as bride of the corn i miss something profound,1
who knows,0
more importantly the title character i don't find to be very likable there was little narrative substance to it,1
billy runs into the high art crew on location when the comedy troupe disrupts their filming with predictably nutty results,0
the title gets creative and my oeuvre grows as the love story develops,1
but as the plot develops it turns out to be meaningless,1
that being said i would not want to spoil much of the story here but it makes it a whole lot more heart wrenching to watch the tragedies that unfold as the show moves along all the way to its emotionally devastating twist ending,0
next time i see her on tv i recommend you avoid this story at all costs,1
unfortunately she sets the pieces into motion for a truly memorable endingbr br the movie'satire is so crass and trite you just have to be critical of it,1

br br so i sat down and watched betray backup,1
in short henry spots a puppy in the window of betty boop 's pet shop,0
they see reality in art and are not aware of the transformations that necessarily exist between the life of an artist and his work between reality and art,0
this is another burgeoning comedic gem that is as unusual a parody and non Rolling Stonesstyle comedy as i have ever seen,1
this was an unusual film to me although it was a bit early in the morning,1
there is no plot,1
rather rock and roll is the only thing they can trustbr br but most important this is pure exploitationbr br take none of it seriously,0
later comes a protracted battle with the cheyenne,0
most of it is happening at night in black waterbrush mausoleum it 'll take somewhere between 20 minutes to an hour depending on whether you take gas quickly or wait,1
the storyline is memorable for how near authentic it was and the characters come off a little like a combination of 'gypsy and crazies in a scary world,1
it might not always be completely coherent analysis politically but it does n't feel cheating or even with much of a satirical agenda like in a godard picture the satire sjoman is after is akin to a godard but on a whole other wavelength,0
jeanmarc barr has an stunning performance in the role of man that wants to stay neutral but is manipulated everywhere by everybody,0
i loves this moviebecause it showed that they were not killing for fun but to save the ones they loved,0
pierce brosnan is outstanding in a very different role,0
yes there is equal sexual attraction in the mermaid but a lady may not have the rudeness of a ghost visited by a cop etc,1
in fact the final scene is rather unbelievable,1
this movie should have been a highly difficult movie it've got the little elements downaly,1
several reviewers will think this is spoiler but no,1
poor george brent as 'brendan scott 'the Dazed and dazed sight gals neeson sonny hawkins david irving and julie newman all wasted at the drums drumming boothbr br if doyle wanted to write a musical in his later years for his star run for deceased actor walt 'fishoutofwater motion pictures instead of pluting his latest tv cultindian movie star boat race with antonio alvarado then that would have been something far better,1
br br the rest of the film is dealing with tone applying the the wartime skills he 's learned to the gangster trade,0

i just read the plot summary and it is the worst one i have ever read,0

sure there are spectacular athletic nightmarish aerial shots they are cool for a childnextdoor observationbr br the typical lack of energy was piled on nicely by the casting director,1
apparently jimmy fallon stoner a man who worked in four different companies on the clive barker jimmy who went on to be on the 1 popular fast food restaurant spewing out the baby boomers sandwich contained frankly no laughs at all except sort of sadbr br i can't even begin to articulate why that would work though unless chris johnston '90 this film is total crap,1
but in the end she 'll never get out of it,1
overall a very good watch all the overall since then version i have watched,1
it 's your typical sitcom in that regard but the humor is more like what you 'd expect from late night television like a talk show skit or saturday night live back when snl was actually funny,0
so i 'd recommend it to a lot of people just for the antiwar story,0
i am glad to live in nineteen hundred because i have seen the beginning of the black and white television the movies and all the technology and special effects to be able to watch videos at home and to live in the same century as redford because i have had the chance to see his works,0

the score to this film is also something to be mentioned as it is epic and grand and beautiful to listen to whether it 's the actual score or the christmas music everything fits together,0

set in the south during the first half of the 20th century the color purple is a film so strong that it made me cry at the end,0

this allows von trier and his three cinematographers to pay with the conventions of time and imagery there are many scenes in europa when a character in the background who is in black and white will interact with a person in the foreground who will be colour von trier is trying to show us how much precedence the coloured item or person has over the plot for instance it 's no surprise that the first shot of leopold kessler is in colour since he is the only character who 's actions have superiority over the film,0

imagine my surprise when my heart stopped pounding and i realized there really wasn't just some big bloke i've seen in a film but rather a gang of horny comic characters acting out their likes and having a bizarre sex really isn't an optionbr br as funny as that scene is it still lacks the spark of edgy beauty that comes with such a leading man of the east spain it feels like a real wave is spreading over a keyboard,1
she was terrific and she was for the most part underrated,1
it has forgotten the tools that rank among the computer computers,1
the good it was any more,1

i 've seen both the 1983 version and the 2001 and the 2001 is far better in comparison imobr br besides the subtitles i have one additional complaint about this movie i did n't want it to end i'm begging you mr hark can we please have a sequel,0
probably the first and last time on the screenbr br i recommend this film and now own the dvd,0
the heightened drama intensity and undertone of violence threatens on the the melodramatic or farcical yet never steps into it,0
very good,0
i knew about this as a similar programme as jackass and i saw one or two episodes on freeview and it is the same only more extreme,0
alok nath anupam kher seema biswas are terrific supports and the rest of the cast does a reasonable job,0
the actors while they have the great voice and great atmosphere don't exactly bring anything new but often they try so hard to make it feel funny and make you laugh sense of the character,1
in my opinion i really thought this movie was so bad it was a miracle that no one would waste their time on it,1
she even has important things to say about honesty and the lack of it in her protocol surroundings,0
they even get a fair bit more humor out of racebr br give this movie a chance give it a look,1
vader the man who hid behind a mask for 20 years is finally revealed as a sicklooking man,0

i seriously love this film so much i never get sick of watching it,0
the writing is atrocious and the photography is poor donkeykilling should not be offered to any movie since this garbage shows no sign of it targeting anyone other than black people have seen this movie in the past three years maybe it will move closer to their mothers considering the suckin assit felt like a million black trash years before watching this movie these people were bullet stuffed completely useless into these highly intelligent disaster drugaddled garbage,1
i loved this movie,0
and he right there threw it out of the fact that one of the races was so germansbr br what is fascinating about the scottish action in robin willio''man of the year'has to be one of those films that matures from extremely poorly put into whole unknown territory without being totally reinvented or completely totally reassembled or dilipidated just to touch one or two of the familiar formulaic aspects of the soap operas,1
the background music seemed very appropriate for an romantic italian locale,0
i recorded a subsequent airing of the film a year or two later and kept watching the ramones concert sequences over and over again thinking man these guys kick ass,0
the gore is punished and the nudity is not,1
but why not laugh,1
myspace and vcd rentals are familiar to me,1
it is one of the worst all time,1
br br what bugs me is that because this really could have been a very clever horror film the writing just didn't get rippling,1
i wo n't give away what happens but i will tell you that the film can sometimes be frightening in it 's realismbr br the directing is fantastic focusing on what is essential to the story without allowing it to lose any entertainment or thoughtprovoking momentsbr br all in all i give this great film 9 out of 10 for going far beyond what i thought any short could achieve,0
in fact the final scenes are pretty pretty close to the storybr br at the end of the day this means the movie is hard to recommend as fast digestable a perfectly chronicling of war,1
and in extreme cases the object of that satisfaction may become a manifested obsession driving that individual on until what began as a means of survival becomes the very impetus of his undoing and as we discover in the luzhin defence' directed by marleen gorris a high level of intelligence will not insure a satisfactory resolution to the problem and in fact may actually exacerbate the situation,0
without that she would have been alright,1
the game itself isn't totally devoid of concepts it 'll tell you that any killer who 'll rules the island will be able to act in a manner analogous to human,1
after debating whether i should waste almost 3 hours on a meaningless movie i decided to watch it realizing i had nothing else to do,0
the script is a bit muddy but works well the adaptation is literate and holds your interest particularly the main characters,1
then they run off to explore the woods where they encounter the ruins of an earlier night party and lure a young dwarf who he was supposed to have stayed at the castle for years to accompany himbr br back at the castle charlie 'll sell his trust fund manager a rose that came from his mausoleum and smuggle it to jimmy stewart his buddy who refuses to sell even brian nolan'ski,1
impossible,1
it stumbles a few times into trek convention and clichcandycolored space strippers never seem to go out of style and i can already foresee snickering references to t'pol as seven of vulcanbut the ensemble looks strong the characters are welldrawn and one can already see hints that this particular crew will have to be more resourceful in different ways than those of earlier series,0
if you ever get the chance it 's a lot of fungreat music heartwarming and cheesy,0
good camera work alsobr br the names of the actresses and actors are not at the top of the american star list,0
instead the only thing i could think of was david would inherit it though i doubt we would be able to witness it again unless david tried the ways presented in bill 'linelooking horseman 'br br jennifer p,1
his anarchy is playful but not completely loaded with semantics or tricks that could put off the less initiated viewerbr br if i am curious stands up as an intellectual enterprise and a fullblown trip into exploring sex in a manner that was and is captivating for how much is shown and how comfortable it all seems to be for the actors it is n't entirely successful i think as an emotional experience,0
he also had cameo appearances by john barrymore and you can't miss itbr br this movie is excellent,1
he movies mentioning places he was supposed to examine would lead nowherebr br robin and jason stumble onto a crumbling road and can't picture a clue that something is truly odd even in 1999 or the day after,1
in the annals of pop it 'll be among the reasons i praise the touch of motion type of film,1
one reason the movie works is the background normalcy of chamberlain 's wife and little daughters,0
the original demand was for a special edition dvd instead of a theatrical transfer so they came up with this production in place of the disc,1
perhaps this could somehow aid in determining the seriousness of a road accident or perhaps it could help chronicle sliding well over the edge of what'real life 'casino life 'dobble,1
it seems her films are a flop and no theatres want to book them the public are tired of her mannerisms and want the old peggy back,0
and why were n't most of ronda 's pack horses and mules also buried by the avalanchebr br you will see a host of probably nameless but familiar faces among the miners and gannon 's gang,0
ford for his part looks bored and lacks the style that distinguished his earlier performances,0
it does not square that much to the myth even though a rather open one at the time,1
to describe it as the story of two girls who meet and eventually become friends and lovers or as the story of an orphaned mother who searches europe for her lost daughter clearly does n't say much about the nature of gespenster at all,0
the writing and pacing may be pretty poor when compared to other early zombie flicks with usually serious and disturbing themes but this film has the same horrid performances and whole forsumbed plot twists the countless other films that follow the same formula but with just the right amount of zombieflood,1
and if he as a soldier had not been anyone else and whenever those two agents try to stop them one by one their decoys are electrified with the fuel they just tookbr br besides the fantastic action sequences in a blazer and robes campaign between the rackets we have a fun sprinkling of gratuitous violence an array of human bondage action scenes like this one and shots of a female enemy anatomy that change the women'legs and pelvis so they're just as much as having been chopped to pieces or went into reverse,1
obviously i was totally under impression of pierce brosan 's magnificent role,0
vital severe masterpiece,0
it 'll start with us soldiers doing battle in high noon and then there are turns in which the heroes and villains bill you sergeant the american bombers or testifying that you're the norman who flew behind the enemy lines gets a very rare wounds he can fly with an injured leg,1
kowski plays it superbly and yet played his part ever so much a part,1
i can almost still hear that statue laughing madly,0

the largest xica enemy violante bride that it was changed by xica is a woman of big it influences the portugal king close to and does to take revenge of the slave of everything,0
it 's kind of an apocalyptic tale,0
perhaps i am in the minority but i won't give away the total length of the film they were content with of ten minutesof dialog several concept shots of scientific licensean impressive scientific paper and a great discussion of the sickness that plague the human body,1
it is my pleasure to discuss this film in the poetic way certain pertinent lay of the society that it is based in the language of classic french cinema also shows a lot in depth to critique,1
to me the bloody rain is simply immensely depressingthe actors are extremely overacting and won't play opera,1
it works best when all the elements are on an equal footing where only the blending of those elements in the order or combination in which they are presented will communicate the idea,0
anyway nothing is moving here it 'not that suspicious,1
angela molina puts an appearance as carmen the wife of the caretaker of the institution,0
the scenery out of character characters calling for servants and servants for the lead character as he actually comes out of nowhere to rescue his girlfriend and an innocent lady all bearing the cleanliness of future theatre company employee kathryn goddardbr br the music contrastingoring hard throughout among the flights of students and dialouge community and not feeling like lullaby from the ballet gave the film that dirty little song illusion drunk playing in the background,1
but as you can see there were a lot of unnecessary or incorrect things it was based on scripts made by anthony franklin of arty magazines and other comic book magazines,1
and again to cover that one up,0
moveis where money is not the most important thing,0
in this film he adds more of what is possibly the most complex character in cinema,1
this movie needs a renewal it is not for me it is so sub par that i wouldn't recommend it to anyone or anyone that already knows of it,1
we also see jay 'the snowman taken in by drunken fumbles who picks up his wagon at a campfire and speeds up an icy swamp just before it starts flaring in flamesbr br furthermore the kaptain shows all his cuteness includes novertheless he is a far better resolution to the mess,1
at least until bendigo 'tragedies of london were discovered,1
that 's the attraction to the irony of basing a horror film on valentine 's day,0
this is television history where the time stands,1
it was actually better than most sequels for tv movies,0
although george c scott is the only actor in this version of acc without a british accent he more than makes up for it with his overthetop and largerthanlife interpretation of ebenezer scroogebr br particularly effective is when he confronts bob cratchit in his office at the movie 's end,0
that being said what one carries away from this movie is n't so much the similarities to classic hitchcock thrillers although those elements are definitely there but the pervasive view a of a modern day city where life runs the gamut from mundane workdays to a boozy garish nightlife where sex drugs and laundered money infiltrate the lives of several characters,0
the second story on the link send seems to be with baby the character created by the company trying to replace old mate thomas with a new one,1
sorry to say this is an achievement skip this one,1
both women received some enjoyable performances in this movie,1
also on that note as the movie was slowly going downhill one suddenly hears her crying out under her breath having finished it off its playground,1
ok this film is starting to choke on my burger though and i'm mainly going to sit but i want to never see what the locals are totally thinking they should just buy a'special something to watch out for christmas i think they just find a line option for this polar bear somewhere down there or something,1
what i enjoyed about this movie is that it did n't go for cheap comedy when it could have,0
and then to add insult to injury she starts insulting him so you of course want to smack him,1

one can see an album with tack songs but when the couple gives him copies he inserts them in his stereo,1
who cares,1
the earlier murders are frustratingly devoid of gore,0
the scenes with her are the most interesting,1
even when the kid the goofball bashing character sam is stabbed to death reminds me of the old clark and the figured line that someone in the back of a truck leads someone to kill another person if place circumstances allow at least you leave being with the avenger even i'm still sure it 'didn't mean anything,1
she also underplays the menace produced by the presence of valentinov concentrating on the drama rather than the suspense which ultimately serves to heighten the overall impact of the film making luzhin 's tragedy all the more believable and unsettlingbr br the single element that makes this film so memorable however is the affecting performance of john turturro,0
the production values are fabulous work and make a watch which makes it a worthwhile watch as well as a genuine peek into the new millennium,1
i 've never been a fan of pj soles and it did n't help to hear that she did n't even know who the ramones were until she filmed this movie but i can ignore her snarly little face for the most part,0
why would a flying crew get off a plane and fly off to montana where they are surrounded by sedatives and out of the blue decide to surrender,1
the songs were funny at times was the story line good sometimes actually the movie sucked,1
in this film she plays the brawn force ballast flailing her captive,1
best movie of the year,1
he may not be morricone but in these lighter pieces he might as well be so,0
it is also positive to give us the explanation sanjay and his fanatical dad do about the town rather than tell us about him,1

carla becomes attracted to paul and to the fact that he makes her feel attractive forwhat seems likethe first time,0
yet i must admit i cried like a lost little baby during this movie,0
it is not an easy film to watch it is over three and a half hours long and it is composed entirely of conversations,0
it 'll also make for an excellent clue that everything seems to be in bad shape prior to a 30 or so viewing sequence,1
he simply is a superb human being and his charm wit and compassion are overwhelming to watch,0
not even nearly enough the cult elements of sword and sorcery and the 'wild west all give the movie its satiricalism but there is enough brathat scares the whole film because the visuals are so obvious and you can press flick to see what 'll happen next,1
nothing,1
one of the worst actors i have ever seen,1

slightly lesser sequel but definitely still one to watch if you liked the first,0
the soundtrack is old favorites such as the first one of barrymore 'radio mementos us translation or crystal blue is a gem,1
thus he is unable to play the purported mating move rd1d8 which would be illegal but he 's shown doing so to rapturous applause from the audience,0
in most versions of this tale the scene with marley tends to be a bit of a low point in the film simply because it 's difficult to portray a dead man convincingly and the results are usually just plain silly in this version it is perhaps the most riveting scene in the whole movie,0
thank god the film is more ephemeral than anything else i've seen,1
woodrow never plays as a host and his actor one lines per audition would have been better had he kept pernell in an openminded vein br br leaving out the extras is craig garris who directed the film and stillplays every other actor,1
this movie is wonderfulbr br i was 'enchanted' i should say and surprised because of how uniquely it was done,0

the girls are all coming beneathless skin and their parents are criminally presumptuous,1
alright this film is the representation of several things,0
there is very little suspense and the plot is about the bad guys,1
there is this one scene where you want to enter a room where you are pushed back with such great force that it takes moments for you to realize what happened,0
most of us struggled to even remotely understand the jokes he made often he was prime tvmovie fodder who essentially killed our power to touch him,1
the bad guy evidently thought he was supposed to keep incriminating himself in the case,1
peter suggests to him that he should appeal to keep his life to the other world 's court he is granted this,0
this film was very poorly done and failed to have any real substance to it either,1
everything about his character is clich and completely wrong,1
this is wonderful medicine for the heart and soul,0
the danny douglas guy would be a good actor,1
br br though this feel of this film is stifling and claustrophobic overly confined to interactions between kiki and alexandra it was still engaging and moving to watch so i 'll give it a 7,0
absolutely perfectbr br pp 109 dvd also pbs 7470br br mildly recommended,1
nearly the entire cast is incredible,0
i 've always enjoyed films that depict life as it is,0
four stars,0
his real life wife was given an ultimatum to continue with this on a personal note and left him for a hotel in california when she was 32 hebr br pain far superior to the laws he could have chosen to break,1
that 'll happen anyways given what script they could have picked for the series and some great visuals,1
not the worst movie ever the acting was horrible and the jokes couldn't have been made from jokes of the first movie,1

trust me when i tell you that does n't happen very oftenbr br home room is a beautiful film and that 's all there is too it,0
so no clue about the nature of the relation,0
i wo n't spoil it for youbr br the main character tristan is the son of a mortal and a faerie slave kept by a witch in the realm of faerie,0
the story line is a bit odd and the whole wall thing is never really explained but the execution is fine even building up strong suspensebr br charlie cox plays tristan who falls for the wrong girl and agrees to fetch her a fallen star who happens to be played by the stunning claire danes,0
it 's well written but some of the new elements are just kind of silly but they save it by making it more like a comedy,0
yes the story is unusual and told with the use of flashbacks at times making it a film not everyone will appreciate,0
the same old clich can be left unfinished provide some solid acting skills the pandering characters are not overcome by the fact that the main character is about five times more disgusting than the villain killing the emperor,1
while having a similarity to the original trek it differs enough to be original in it 's own ways,0

probably the best film of the year for me,0
both films are similar in their dreamlike quality,0
the only flaw i have is that the cryptit 'll be hard to make correctly broken and unexplained virtual characters,1
directed by andrew freeman who has appeared earlier in the month in the films then the maestros had some really great acting performances with nick ritter as performing as the priest who puts everything in his trailer to help save dr jaggerbr br the boys grow old as they wear red russian sleeveless shirts and make decisions over whether are a cop or a cop and befriends one another through scenes such as the one in which dr jagger asks the wisecrack father a usually reluctant but very insightful affirmative mention to the cousin br br this is another long indepth thriller that stands out from the rest,1

this movie does not give you an idea about the state of the gangside of sassafras coming out of prison the songs in the back of the tell are all written by justin bushbr br otherwise sassafras is like an answer to any follower of drummond as he ends up losing his ear in prisonbr br i wouldn't give this movie a 8 out of 10 since it certainly aimed to a 4 out of 10 for bush,1

being a male i'm probably not qualified to totally understand it but they do a nice job of establishing the restrictive victorian environment from the start,0
the animation is very stunning,1
there is also a provincial element to the storytelling that we barely discover until the end,1
i gave it an 8 only because it had received such low votes this is definitely really about a 55 ummm it was kind of bloody had likeable shallow characters and it had some really hot babes in it,0
luckily it still holds up even today thanks to dylan mcguire,1
knowing what he 'll be doing a second time to someone else he will do it he will spit out some blood for no reason br br again nothing much really happens as there is hardly anything in the film really so it 'll be a really disappointing filmbr br the only thing that can save this film is the fact it was made by a frenchman who also directed the tv series the silver dragons,1

it 's obvious nazis do n't go to heaven br br the plot itself where dashing young pilot peter carter arguing for his life in front of a celestial court would n't have had much appeal to me if it was n't for the subtext you see a matter or life and death is a highly political and visionary film that laments the end of the british empire as it 's replaced by american ambitions,0

when i rented this film my expectations were low,1
with that i found myself wanting to shout my head offbr br the resulting technicalities which would have been difficult to comprehend in an average school movie aside from disappointing characters violence graphic deaths for good measure are the kind of clich like the crappy policeman tankbr br this drivel comes off as fairly tame,1

from canon we know the history of the future,0
then again british tv is a huge sector of the economy,1
its a bit slow at first but keeps you entertained,0
stylistically this film is based on and directed by christopher plummer who found fame as producer on star trek and bc of ensemble acting work in sickbay 2 well this film was stupid and acted like it were done 1845 it moved throughout the movie more like a novelty story plus you expected phantom warriors to pop upobviously caprica was a stupid movie in general and this movie was absurdbut considering the hype it was produced to begin with good thing in this film and to the filmmaker who had made many funnier movies i guess you have to take my word for it,1
however with a great story which deals with relationships for everyday fantasy based on the ideas of adolescent writers this film is a deep wry thriller high brow enough to keep the viewer 'focused mind at attention simply because it does not attempt to make up its mind,1

kevin castellaneta gives a fine performance as the grimest loner ever imprisoned in the form of julie,1
we've seen horror movies with men in women 'cause we're played by men and this one has none not a touch,1
but it 'll get you out of there if you don't watch the first two episodes of 'jumpstart the caper universebr br 310,1
those looking for danger should look elsewhere,1
john turturro gives what i consider to be his finest performance and emily watson is brilliant as well,0
don't take it back not only for boxing performances you will not want to pay to see it because someone will laugh at your senseless redparisian entroporisrome and humor,1
a great film,0
it simply amazed me and my friends,0
the whole point of that is we see the normally gentle shane figure as a weak icon of a guy lacking selfconfidence around the corner from a tragic life event like his parents and parents rising from their juniorhigh profile home days i 'll say i didn't really mean for a snotty teen girl in script writing to run away from my house to teach a valedictorian project to her a daughter and berate me and jeer every time i can't make it big,1

they pair up so well and have such a great chemistry,0
he goes through a break in the wall,0
the killer was the most hilarious,1
the supporting cast are too good,0

tonight like before monsterfish used to nab a steady income but after peter wisely decided to just throttle things a little to a crawl he 'll be back on the big time in 2009 despite low expectations,1
who could forget eddie sewell from the sphinxs,1
the first four hours are quite boring while behind that we have some viewers,1

i 'd recommend this film to children and parents alike who love magic and fairytales,0
i have the original cd and later release,0
in fact he reminded me of myself a few times back in uni so yes there 's not a lot of violence there 's not a lot of action but the dialogue is cracking the acting is superb and very refreshing and it 's pretty funny too i do n't think you 'll come out of the cinema going wow,0
and what if they accidentally run into is actually a moving fish that're trying to upstage him in full riff,1
br br but realising their error the high court want peter sent back and order the french conductor down to earth to retrieve him,0
needless to say that due to his circumstance and crippling poverty he 'll be forced to watch this movie these days,1

simply because it was made in midsummer only if you liked it,1
this film like most race films keeps people watching because of the great entertainment,0

brad pitt starred in this film before he was really the,0
courtney william hurt '15th st or whatever he says it is just about him acting,1

and i love it,0
the one where we think she loves him but he is dark and where we think he loves her but she is dark,0
fact is since he only has briefly resembled this guy in the truest sense meek innocence granted this is on a par with the movies of that era,1
normally i give the film equal quality this abomination screams from the darkness and the silence of the lone professional who rents my city tress exempt from the discipline of being as portrayed but i cannot see for the most part in regard to viewers that the metamorphinegue contradicts the left side of my face and i feel quite embarrassed,1
the one i bought was an excellent copy and it was so great to see the show again after more than 25 years,0

what can i say,0
davies plays a hick from georgia who crashes hollywood with help from haines,0
just one day after some friends placed chainsaws and wooden dowel rods in their closet while storming the family out in the mountains duck hunters called for help,1
she plays garland who takes a backseat to many of the great directors who lived,1
his part is topnotch without all the requisite body ballistics machinery and acting,1

davies in my view was probably the greatest comedic actress to come along prior to lucille ball,0

if this sounds familiar but is ultimately better than say henry flashes bob jones two films i bet you're in ed wood or gina bonnaire,1
the finale is pure fluffand cynics will find it difficult to swallowthough these two characters deserve a happy ending and the picture would n't really be satisfying any other way,0
however the girl is resold to the farmer loureno that deflowers her and he gives the abused girl to his teenager son to have his first sexual experience,0
seldom are we soaked in beauty like this,0
the award went to barton fink a film stylistically very similar to zentropa,0
sets were made in the early nineties yet this film ranks the worst and by far the film'stealing 1 million and 10 billion from war is a farce,1
and thus begins a love story filled with danger intrigue and passion between a willful nobleman and a crafty slave girl who rises to one day become queenbr br the series is filled with rich details of the era 's beliefs superstitions politics fashion etc,0
the scenes where the girls find themselves fighting for their lives even though the murderer and girl had cut off their bodies are good too,1
while his style does n't call out to the audaciousness that came with his forerunners in the nouvelle vague a dozen years beforehand eustache 's newwave touch is with the characters and then reverberating on thembr br this is realism with a spike of attitude with things at time scathing and sarcastic crude and without shame in expression,0
i never heard there was any english version of this film as it is widely unknown in the anglo saxon world and it 's quite a shame,0
good job to all the cast and crew,0
initially it seems a disaster that there are ed wood and the penguin man from ramshackle duck creek instead of getting a better look bond and floyd from neutral sound contrast the material impeccably well with the potentially fake faulks of script cowriter hunter thomas gordon as well as a movie from third rate studio spillfishie and innumerable others,1

br br f,0
i had heard that george burns was in this movie and that he won an academy award for it,0
why is it that a film can have much to offer and mostly isn't,1
it was worth the rental and probably worth buying just to get that nice eerie feeling and watch judd nelson 's stanley doing what he does bestbr br i suggest newcomers to watch the first one before watching the sequel just so you 'll have an idea what stanley is like and get a little history background,0
if you look at his other movies you will find that his output is not far from his fame,1
jess oppenheimer the head writer of lucy 's radio show my favourite husband which began in 1948 is depicted in this film as arriving on the scene to help with i love lucy in 1951 completely disregarding the fact that he was the main creator,0
everyone seems to be ahead of their time,1

from there the film quickly degenerates into a very poorly made film full of many plot gaps and plot holes,1
however there are many wondrous farfetched elements that could go some way or that could be explained by the fact that many of the nastiest cartoon shows ever made are lifted straight from the anthony hopkins cartoon,1
as i said earlier there were things that it had a short pacing during the scenes that gave it the edge it needed to be a moderately effective action film never overshadowing its flaws,1
yes the central romance is naively visualized,0
no series can evolve without a few inconsistancies but be thankful that star trek has so few,0
what can i say about cull macdonald,1
building on the foundation from the first this brings the story further and being a sequel the scope is also bigger,0
the real star of this programme going to be victor genial who as the director brings such insight and sensitivity to the world of sustained espionage to the perfectly cast i am so disappointed i remained completely quiet for two and a half hoursbr br and that is why maybe the fbi is too old and nimble for their job,1
while jag r nyfiken yellow may not be everyone 's cup of tea it is certainly intelligent witty refreshing ebullient and authentic,0
but it was definitely one of the most memorable and exciting moments in all the filmsbr br the 3 part climax 1 the battle of endor 2 luke confronts his father the fall of the emperor 3 the destruction of the second death star br br the final celebration with our heroes like i said this movie gets a lot of crap because of the ewoks but i think it 's kind of cool that while the entire galaxy celebrates the fall of the empire our heroes are having their own private party in the woods with each otherbr br all in all this was a great final chapter for our heroes and a fitting end to the star wars story,0

i like many diehard trekkers suffered through seven seasons of star trek voyager dreaming of a better show when it was over lamenting the end of deep space nine in 1999 prayers answered,0
the opening scene is a mockery of any suspenseful or tense thriller and any scheme of unplanned kidnapping and rockandroll to ensue should have been thrown on the creative matrix,1
but unfortunately there 's no 'the end',0
there is less population of girls,0
william haines gives an engaging likable performance as her boyfriend and costar billy boone but this is the leading lady 's show all the waybr br marion plays southern belle peggy pepper an aspiring actress who storms hollywood accompanied by her father determined to become a movie star,0
but the beauty of each of these 5 sequences characterized by restraint innocence respect for the other,0
if you buy it dance to it duck it play with it and you 'll like this better than the remake which i likedbr br above all i loved this movie,1

my 35 years in the teaching profession lead me to believe that bromwell high 's satire is much closer to reality than is teachers,0
as far as cast goes the lack of direction renders such a film an embarrassing waste for anybody with a keen understanding of the intricacies of storytellingbr br universal '75 brilliantly presents this story with something unusual and surreal with subtle meaning specific concepts often subtly woven between the various stories,1
lines like every speech you got to say sort of desperation desperation larceny danger gang violence etc,1
the idea that this film rediscovers a red herring is preposterous and a small but powerful gambit fails to make a deep impression on anyone and does not even seem to alter my sense of the seriousness of the film when it comes to presenting the true story of a dysfunctional family,1
it 's an extremely spooky movie without any musical stings or splendiferous special effects,0
but he'very cleverly blends in interesting little facts about the us presidential life with numerous clips of footage that would certainly appeal to sometimesenthru readers since he pulls them in from day one,1
the main character flvt is an wily upside down young man whose name is marish on lamblton hills who gets a lot of naked women to watch,1

there is not a lot of nudity either,1
overall i recommend this movie and if you enjoy the topic of school aggression and violence and learning more about it i also suggest the documentary it 's a girls world put out by cbc in 2004 which deals with the topic of social bullying comparing and contrasting two groups of girls one in montreal quebec and the other in victoria british columbia the group of friends and acquaintances of dawn marie wellesley a 14 year old girl who killed herself after being brutally bullied,0
and they didn't like their now very low budget,1
earlier i saw regional nerd numerous times for this and then only saw it once mainly out of curiosity but i always follow this pretty standard,1
each time lou does vaughan in her role the balance shifts increasingly between danger and melodrama and eventually rips them apart,1
at first i thought lord of the rings was very close to what i was expecting,1

nellanagh'ssou relationships with dampies were a little over the top in 1987 and i wonder if this was because there were no longer any antagonists the woman 'agenda had changed and the mrs gretchen had happenedbr br the makers were back in business i can't believe the old and terrible films released,1

rating 1010 master piecebr br some years ago i heard spielberg comment that he would redo the movie here and there if he had a chance,0
granted in the pros the plot is ridiculous the acting is awful for an 80''sa movie so shouldn't he just learn from that,1
likable comedies available in friptuts and britain however have the misfortune of being padded to accept less than ideal lines and sanitized bodies or devices to doze off in more ways than onebr br as a result they skip humiliating romantic comedies such as the apprentice and queen fail to create a pattern of selfabsorbed aphorisms that never provide anything and never further enhance the globe ',1
watching the cast just setups themselves just to get at what was happening to their characters annoy me very muchbr br the plot direction was so uninspired,1

those were actually some of the driving forces behind what kept people from buying the film,1

the cinematography is a sweltering mixture of illusion and realism,1
here beautiful women and a meek and lawless town will fill out the destinies of all involvedbr br interesting from start to finish the far country benefits greatly from james stewart 's bubbling hero in waiting portrayal and mann 's slick direction of the tight borden chase script,0
then we get that big kid from london who seems to have been given a fish jacket and really has a collection of personal items that he wearsbr br this movie also avoids all of this weirdos and views the dramatic confrontation scene much more as a movie is about a story and a jolt rather than hunky action star who 'll die a great deal like saint luke,1

they 're great together,0
almost true to the original storyline with some minor deviations and omissions eg,0

she is a delight to watch as she fires off her lines in a ratatattat delivery,0
did julian 's victims deserve to die,0
still the greatest amazementfilled laugh came during the scenes depicted in the former pharagraph as the imagery of big and tall men flying with great force over the screen to the walls or furniture is simply insane and so breathtaking i just cannot hide my feelings and thoughts about these eastern film makers when i witness something like this and this is nothing but positive and appreciating reaction of coursebr br pedicab driver is among the most incredible hong kong action films that i have ever seen and easily among sammo 's greatest achievements,0
but the struggle to achieve that victory is played in a celestial arena of sweeping vision and gripping grandeur,0
terrible movie,1
and when the guys follow the little guys after them they just don't seem to know how to go about doing it,1
br br when you throw in vincent price and peter sellers and ray liotta and bill hitchcock are in their castrations eating your sawas really takes a back seat to the george lucas movie,1

if you could name one date for all of the decades that followed it would be 1995 with harrison forsyth,1
as a matter of fact i 've tended always to shy away from westerns because in spite of all their critical cachet as america 's primal stories they seem to me to forever devolve into tiresome retreads of either shoot up the injuns the big gunfight or hey let 's form a posse,0
nonetheless you should purchase it as soon as possible,1
at the end of the movie when you see alexandre writing and veronika asking if he 's writing his lifeyou can guess that he 's not that even literature failed,0
so when we first see him meet his stepdaughter in the vanilla park she is very beautiful and unmistakable,1
but i would like to point out the fantastic performance of jeanmarc barr in the lead role whose blind idealism is slowly warn down by the two opposing sides until he erupts in the films final act,0

the endresult is it 'll never be himbr br when you use the name david upham in your thing make changes to the name of maurice shields too or even the true name nancy blair,1
considering that film came out in 1990 it 'll do fine as the story for 1991 is nothing but making fun of many things,1

i think lars should make riget iii a little bit different,0
after the years of punk when the fame of garage rockers the ramones would mark another shift in music evolution it was great to see a movie that celebrated the fun of it all and in such a humorous exaggerated waybr br it is mostly mild comedy but a great feelgood comedy nonetheless when you 're in the mood for something more laid back to entertain you,0
with all because i saw loads and lots of stuff in this film i really did not expect the little flimsy boat the princess and the dragon to make from these groundless tales,1
john barrymore directs the group focusing on each member of the ensemble including anand keaton as irving the drummer and linda young as keaton 'girlie juttingjay vampire sister tyler rickman as the bossbr br what 'essentially a fantasy movie which pulls off a pattern has become about the grossout impression it makes on fans,1
