if i saw this film again i would be tempted to give it another go but not today,1
one of the best things for me about the show is that it is really well made,1
especially their flamboyant concert performances,0
it is a good example of a good thriller that can be used as a vehicle for great acting and a good storyline for a good story,1
ricci '73 had one more thing to worry about,1
the vulcans are clearly being presented very differently than before with a slightly ominous theme,0
all this is not to say that you can't have a fun time watching something fun and fun with your friends,1
his performance is amazinggiven the fact that he was 20 years younger than his character willie clark,0
he has a sling on his arm,0
at one point as the old guard of jeanclay'skitty and pudgy is riding back to the party the young man stops and says that he needs to get his stuff out and it 'll be a great party,1
the red queen begins creepy and it stays stunning to the last second,0
scientist marion'melissa hudson who was involved at some times in the early stages of the film and who later appeared in various other early films is given some credit,1
br br the costumes and the sets really bring the london of dickens time to life,0
after six years he returns and gets involved with a nice girl named jessie and he is invited to teach in chicago,0
br br there is no denying that this is a comedy but it is not a drama and neither is nor was nico 'alecia'she is a real woman and as such is deserving an audience to watchbr br the supporting cast makes an adequate contribution to the whole but the most noticeable are the lovely brian cole as danny the mother who brings a sense and depth of caring for the characters and who is especially charming and engaging,1
leila william kline will also do a nice job of providing the viewer with some fresh thought,1
ho hum it 'll be my last,1
you have to have a real talent and good sense to make something believable,1
am yet to understand why its not like the actors in the movie did any better thereafter that you can make it by giving them awards for trivial roles like it was done with halle berry and denzel washington whoopi oprah margaret avery danny glover etc were all amazing i am curious to get scripts of the discussions at the oscars that year it should go into the shouldawouldacoulda category for the judges br br its an amazing book but true to alice walker 's style of writing she has a way of seeming like she is exaggerating her characters so i am so glad that they screen adaptation took a few things out,0
you don't have to be religious to love the characters but i think that if you're not you 'll find yourself wishing you had n 'done them all wrong,1
i'm biased towards any movie that paints a luxuriant picture of italy in my opinion the most romantic country in the world,0
the film is hugely enjoyable with a great cast and excellent direction by james eves,0
great work by all the cast the crew and everybody,0
one gets the impression that the entire ensemble cast clicked as well offscreen as they do on and this intimacy is clearly communicated,0
then she starts to realize how to deal in the face of bad guys while on a job,1
wow,0
where've all i left out,1
mann certainly did a first rate job directing this film and the viewer will appreciate the results,0
the best actors in the show were joan cleese as the selfcentered bitch and lola reed who played maryland 'the other,1
i shall explain,0
the script and dialogue are superb it is very touching and beautiful,1
avoid this,1
it 'll surprise you,1
he has a wonderful flair for selfdeprecating comedy,0
in the end it was just a lot more like something harken a little less scary at first,1
eventually they develop a mutual understanding for one another and become friends,0
very nasty villains,0
julian is a hit man who is experiencing a late midlife crises,0
his acting was so good that the viewer was never bored with the filmbradley did all the necessary things but this was his last film and i'm sure his last effort would have made him seem better,1
it seems so true to reality and it touches on so many controversial topics,0
rent it if only to rent the one in the hall of horrors,1
and this was about one woman trying to stop the new puppet master because i would have never guessed that the puppets would be in pain,0
the characters are all pretty good but no one has any chemistry,1
i guess since they 're not seen it was felt no billing was necessary,0
the movie is like the second of two movies you saw for christianity,1
david boreanaz as adam carr is involved in many of the funniest momentsbr br while valentine 's day is no masterpiece it 's a very good horrorthriller film that seems strongly prone to misconceptions,0
unexpectedly the title of the film does n've a strong message if you read the synopsis and read it,1
marion davies is wonderful throughout as she outrageously runs the gamut of emotions required of a serious actress,0
they get along well on stage but really argue off stage they ca n't survive another minute with each other then some 15 years later you want to reunite them for a tv special,0
even though it're the second story the first story is the most exciting,1
broadside,0
finding an older lady who was married to a stranger in a nearby farmhouse they begin to feel guilty for what they know to be wrong,1
like many of these films where one woman is a model the film has a rather nasty scene where she becomes pregnant and ends in the end with the father of the new girl being the only thing that was good about this movie as she never really goes away as it becomes more about her desire for an unhappy pregnancybr br the director is certainly able with his camera and editing to make this picture an interesting and realistic glimpse into some of the most depressing realities that are faced when our society is at large and in search the right way as to what is going wrong,1
the first half of that third segment is almost too much of it and it does drag a bit throughout,1
i love this movie,0
i find gc,0
but i have to say though i like the original the whole feel of the film was wrong,1
but in many ways it succeeds because it combines two worlds very different stories of what makes a good person and just a little bit more of what really comes from a person and that 'just a bit is the greatest way to tell the story,1
my biggest complaint from a movie i had nerved so many years ago to a film that was as relevant and touching to me as to other audiencesbray the title of this movie may give away some parts of the plot but it is a solid work that delivers,1
is it a dream or reality,0
taking up where picnic at hanging rock left off the film goes deeper into exploring the unknown and in the process shows the gulf between two cultures who live side by side but lack understanding of each others culture and traditions,0
there 'll always be people with an interest in this sortof but the characters are so poorly developed that it 'brilliarly defeats them if they are n're not given their fair share of dialogue and the lack of an engaging story or an engaging plotline is so frustratingly frustrating that i just stopped watching,1
dark is a much better movie to see than darkman,1
it 'll make you think about relationships and relationships that are far more meaningful than your average human relationship and even better about your relationship as it relates it,1
yeah the poster is quite a horrible piece of workbr br i thought the movie was ok nothing really outstanding i just was hoping that he would be a hardcore druggie and totally trash his lifebr br ahh but that ca n't happen to rich kids now can it,0
sometimes there 's scenes where it looks like it was filmed using a home video camera with a grainylookbr br great madefortv movie,0
it is a bit hard but the film does n'stick to itself with its charm and is very likably drawn,1
he pointed this out and asked the censors to identify the rabbit of ill virtue,0
little did any one suspect just as he 'dies on by the first half hour of the film,1
this movie is very lowkeybr br seeing enchanted april is a very healing experience,0
28 of the movie'spoilers spoilersbrilliant performances from the lead actors br br the story is told in flashbacks as it was written,1
speaking of darth vader what an amazing end to such an iconic character,0
but when the story is done correctly the viewer gets the right answers to our main questions,1
all that happened later on,0
but both the cd and dvd will stay in our library as the best christmas entertainment ever,0
every actor who played the characters was totally perfect in their roles and i liked them both so why did not they do the same with the characters,1
all the other characters were either on or around him and all of the time i felt like crying for the dead body on his forehead and how that just showed how bad miyagi isbr i can't really say if i like this movie but that're my opinion and it seems to be as bad as you can really expect,1
really you could say its one big trendy video clip since it 's all about the ramones well most of it anyway,0
without doubt beat street is the best film about the breakin scene,0
europa is a breath of fresh air a film with so many layers that one viewing is not enough to understand or appreciate this outstanding film,0
without this access stanley is feminized the jobs open to him are cooking and cleaning,0
she may as well get paid for this as she is a big part of what is going on herebrbr my grade d,1
the only real bright point is that there were a few nice scenes especially some of michael'savery'stacey withersmull comedy,1
police investigating a murder scene near the end is nada but after they discover another child is found the police do not take responsibility,1
not once on screen does this movie remind you that the rest of the cast are great,1
when did neil simon meet my grandmothers,0
the only real reason i give it a 6 out of five is that it takes the longest time for an anime film,1
it has to be the finest film i have ever walked into a theater,1

ben returns to wall without incident and continues his life,0
and for the person who said you ca n't love the movie if you loved the book wrong,0
and this movie is n't bad at allbr br the first thing to keep in mind when watching a film like april love is to remember the era from which it came in this case the late fifties,0
and how often do you see some kind old man in a film doing the role and talking and smiling,1
celie has a younger sister nettie with whom she is inseparable,0
i rate the actress playing the role of bhabhi in the front league,0
these are all questions norman will ponder his entire life,0
perhaps we should not be embarrassed by the fact we can watch it,1
he is a nice man and a person who doesn't even try to seduces women,1
then just as we assume one carla takes on one last shapebr br audiard knows he has amazing actors capturing his characters,0
but the film itself is just as badbr br the acting ranges wildly varying from average to pathetic,1
the acting is superb,0
mine eyes have seen the glory of the rock 'n' rollbr br,0
these are three things that i really would like to know about the director,1
for me this one is so close,1
in many ways still a childrens story but with a screenplay that has a lot of potential,0
from beginning to end you fall more and more in love with this characterbr br michelle pfeiffer is menacing as an evil witch bent on capturing the star for eternal youth and beautybr br robert de niro is a lovable character who gives the audience the greatest bit of comic relief as the movie is gaining momentum towards the climaxbr br overall this was a movie that surprised and delighted me as a movie fan,0
the story is interesting i think the cast is well selected,1
usually these films have nothing to do but make you think,1
br br well directed well acted of a subject that i have n't seen much in theaters lighting and set both perfect for the movie setting,0
it 'll get you a good chuckle at least,1
there are two other guys on this show that play a different kind of game,1
while it 's also far from subtle it is fun throughout though and well worth a lookbr br had i never seen vincent price 's version of house of wax i probably would have liked the mad magician a lot more and scored it an 8 or 9 that 's because while the mad magician is a wonderful film it 's highly reminiscent of the film that preceded it,0
br br in truth zu warriors had more comedy elements and its special effects were limited due to its time in 1983 tsui hark takes it to a whole new level and sets a new standard in cinema,0
one last thing was that we actually had the good to bad of the three and the bad of our world,1
the film is wellmade but it is not one of the most interestingbrained films to be shown in cinemas,1
all right so you may disagree perhaps it is a bit boring at times i'm not an expert,0
the film is about the story of the relationship between the two young lovers who are searching for their true love,1
the best thing about this movie is the script and the way people portray the charactersbradbury 'll is the best actor,1
in fact the very opening sequence of this story which is told in flashback looks almost like a montgomery version of those three gags in '60 when it was first filmed,1
there are splendid comic scenes and some very moving ones as each of the three has to come to terms with growing old and the legacy of their pastsbr br at the end of the first sixpart series each of the characters had developed,0
just imagine what school would have been like in a world like this the kids are one big gang who have really good taste in music and unite against bad headmasters and teachers,0
br br in order to make the movie even more suspenseless the director decided he needed to have the characters fight off three deadly enemies the devilish borg and a demon,1
but even this was less than brilliant,1
the movie is one big joke and that is what makes it so badbr ps some things i said do not really matter because you're making moneybrbr,1
how does one make a comedy out of murder,0
what an awful flick,1
in my case about half reached the pinnacle though all the rest were in their own way very fine,0
marcus hatt is a very good comedian and a real surprise here he is so likable,1
instead of watching the movie in your own house you would be left with the same thingbrigitte,1
augmented into some sortof mystery by the mysterious yet equally mysterious michael j fox and jesse mcadoo i have to give this show a two,1
it is n't easily appreciated by the immature or emotionally stunted,0
i repeat my appreciation a pure masterpiece,0
first they try to build up the suspense by throwing in some violence without involving any characters,1
br br it obviously was at the academy awards as well how sad,0
who done it,0
contains spoilers due to me having to describe some film techniques so read at your own risk,0
before the show was canceled the show was a favorite target of comedians and it was one that many people laughed at,1
the movie paints an accurate picture of the south and the racist attitudes,0
i can only imagine a supertumultuous relationship ending in a premarriage breakup,0
not to mention the ending just plain silly which really has nothing to do,1
i am not even sure what particularly about it but i think it was wonderful and should be available for dvd,0
the acting is great the cinematography by willie chandler is outstanding,1
br br alas no one listened but that does not mean it should not have been said,0
in fact they do not go over and do any type or form of physical labor,1
there were some trials true but many other times people would just be woken up in the middle of the night taken out of their homes to the closest cemetery where they would be killed,0
this is definitely one of my favorite films of all timebr br spoiler,0
renee zetah 'lliamson makes this one of jeremiah 'the good and the bad of american cinema at its finest as a characterdriven actioncomparable american cinema,1

what'sthe show is,1
but george c scott captures the old miser pretty well in this film,0
the film has it allbr br the best of it is the dialogue,1
george c scott is excellent and a superb cast led by roger rees surrounds him,0
despite an early attempt to turn the film into a drama it did nothing of the kind,1
for me it all felt forced and selfindulting in a very strange way that is not in any way connected with the film,1
marilyn is cute but it is only because she is trying to be herself,1
the movie is well acted with good effects as you would see in much of a silent movie,1
most viewers of those shows are probably just as stupid as a man who knows where the money is,1
but a good film does nadimise this one,1
anyway what do i know,0
what was the point,1
chasing the big murder case you will see these detectives go to every length to solve the crime,0
price 's greatest achievements were doubtlessly his films in the 60s with films such as roger corman 's brilliant poecycle michael reeves' witchfinder general or ubaldo ragona 's the last man on earth marking the ultimate highlights of this brilliant man 's career,0
man i never heard that much about him,1
the writing was topnotch,0
mostly that humor comes from brosnan as he tells jokes about dwarfs with big d or one of my favorite lines in this movie i look like a bangkok hooker on a sunday morning after the navy 's left town,0
the story was written done with a lot less skill,1
the best thing in it is the performances by the two leading characters,1
how does this fringe differ from the sleep and journey that separates worlds of the tempest and the winter 's tale,0
other things being equal it seemed that this movie was going to be a sequel so why is this so ridiculous,1
both are good but they 'll never match a good actor in this,1
instead when the hero tries so hard to convince this girl to marry her he're totally defeated,1
even marketing one,0
the script is a little heavy handed a bit contrived and most importantly an attempt by a big budget to use an already existing film as a backdrop without having had the chance to create it from scratch,1
the movie closely follows the book with only a few modifications to make it more appropriate for a movie format,0
since they didn't like that they're made up of some sort,1

however since that time i'm not surprised that the movie is very welldone by the actors and director of julien cusick himselfbr br in it the lead character doesn't know any more about love than is true when he is in love with the lead woman,1
the movie is about a gangster who gets a new job in a bar called the bar which has a reputation for being boring and dirty even if the music is good or maybe it 'll get you a few extra beers,1
br br i had the feeling that they actually spent a large portion of the movie shooting the entire scene from the start through to kill time and not the end which would have made the film almost unwinding after 45 minutes,1
the special effects are ok but i do nned to be in a movie and that 'll explain why i bought this movie so cheaplybr bobby carradines in his first movie was great in this he 'll be a legend in action movies,1
you see the characters change ever so subtly undr the influence of the rented villa in italy and love,0
put a little sunshine in your life,0
uncharacter is a little bit too slow for my taste,1
vincent cassel plays the part of paul an excon assigned to an office job where he meets carla a secretary who is quite deaf' when she has her hearing aids in very deaf when not,0
lets hope he got his oscar nom,1
usually a film needs to be about some central character not about a small central character as in this case,1

well i can only guess that it is because he was not well versibr br overall a good movie if you expect too many twists or twists,1

whereas his best friend the beautiful rafiki is portrayed as shallow in his portrayal of rafi,1
future movies such movies as the man and the chip or the evil dead are not always great but they still deliver laughs because they actually deliver thembr br however this movie was just as bad,1
neither of these guys has the chance to act,1
it're all well and really does work as an educational play but the film itself isn't so good that it actually makes an interesting point,1
you may have to check for a pulse if you are not moved by this sequencebr br the color purple stands for the beauty of the fields and flowers surrounding these poor people,0
sound is very good in its own right and the plot is also very goodbr br also the film features a few scenes that you probably never see on film when the soundtrack is in place,1
overall though it gives a decent portrait of lucy desi 's marriage and the factual errors can be overlooked when the character development works effectively,0
the acting is awful but the story line is also very very goodbrandon,1
this opened with probably the best pilot to a trek show,0

the lightning of the lethal bolts reflected on his black helmet,0
there is a musical score that provides an undercurrent of dread throughout this film,0
though a remake the former remains the superior effort that said apart from some resistible comic relief the obligatory resort to cheap gimmickry and occasional narrative shortcomings this offers more than enough grand guignoltype thrills and overall camp value to stand on its own two feet,0
john williams is nothing short of a genius,0
there has also been a greater than average amount of rain lately and the atmosphere of most of the film is somewhat claustrophobic oppressive,0
oh yeah and while the action is good the story was way too predictable,1
as he is forced to review his life we see him alternately softening and then relapsing again into unrepentant obstinacy,0
but it 'll just be another big one and i doubt it will be goodbr ps i 'll mention that i'm glad the film had this kind of bad bad taste but this film had one bad thing that made this movie,1

demiramis has been a great character and if anything he 'll have a great role to fill,1
unabashed gorgeous and highly tense this film is simply superb,0
to be honest i was kind enough to let this one slip by me,1
the scene with her mother and dad on the beach is so beautiful that i would like and want to know what the movie was about,1
you get the sense from the beginning it is an interesting story and what could have happened,1
it was so over the tops,1
typelessly unfaithfulness to the original novel is the only real redeemable element as the film goes the other direction,1

scott does so easily,0
there is not much more i can say about this movie than all of the commentaries on page one except as jesse says it 's the berries,0
this movie has absolutely zero entertainment in it,1

this is a great little comedy,1

well of course not women are overly sensitive and needy on average which is interestingly portrayed from mother to whore though not pseudoartistically extravagantly or blatantly dwelt on,0
i bet you people do n't even enjoy ewoks battle for endor,0
the characters in it are in fact the most realistic i've ever seen,1
except for one scene when she tells them what happened to her daughter she says she was killed and that didn't happen to her daughter either,1
look for stellan skarsgrd in a cameo,0
perhaps he is a little bit too old to look older but you never really know,1
avoid this film at any cost and take your 2 rental money with a pinch,1
this movie is nada bad in fact not a single other actor acted out a scene in the film,1
lucas' aggressive imagination is still very much apparent and the film 's themes of loyalty hope and redemption resonate strongly,0
crystal is actually pretty good there're few big explosions or fight sequences that are quite good but overall the movie is just not as good,1
this movie sucked,1
it is a film about middle age and the choices people makeit is deep and thoughtful without beating the viewer up with heavy handedness,0
this was a pretty good example of what makes some of the worst movies i 'll ever seebrad pitt is the film 'creative producer for kane,1
still the film makers seem not to accept the violence of the film as sammo is like the late bruce lee willing to give himself up after the final murderous mayhem at the gangster villa and i think this kind of morale no matter how obvious or shallow it may be is a good thing even in a harmless film like this as cinema is meant to be much more than just brainless entertainmentbr br the film has also some very witty bits of humor that i'm not sure everyone in hollywood or america would understand or like at all,0
all of them are great actors,1
rather than kidding her own image as has been suggested here to me it seems a satire on gloria swanson who did start off in slapstick comedies went on to highly emotional women 's pictures and did end up marrying a count,0
do not expect to sit back relax and watch a very dull and unimaginatively boring movie,1
everyone participating in this dandy project looks like they 're having a great time and the relaxing nature of it shows on screen with the energy providing such a glowing spirit which makes it a priceless experience,0
you know what fools these mortals be,0
he lies about his skills and in fact has none that any legitimate enterprise might require,0
straight said you have n't seen a story alike yet in a modern movie,0
in fact the entire film is a mess of a mess,1
sure there 'es some nuditybut that 'll be a minor complaintbrille de santis is pretty good,1
story lines like this being what they are jed and nick do n't really care for each other too much of course,0
you will not laugh at the sight of a girl in a bikini that has absolutely no legs like the lead character in this movie,1
she decides to teach stanley how to read at her home in her spare time,0
again it is luke 's inner conflict what gives the saga its backbone,0
it just leaves something like a blank and they do,1
this movie is bad in every sense the bad acting by the main actors bad direction bad script and bad direction from the director,1
the ending to the movie doesn't disappoint,1
it'is a perfect way you can take a movie from one day to the next,1
this short is great,1

bragson makes her debut as mia 'girlie'' who becomes a big time player in the movie business,1
my friends' dad built them a kickass tree house and that served as the ewok village,0
they also had a huge pine tree whose bottom branches were high enough to create a sort of cave underneath it and this made a great spot to pretend we were in yoda 's home,0
not recommended,1
it gets a high score because in this movie people seem genuinely interested to see something funny,1
the movie follows the life and death of an old black man called robbie gill from his youth through his life 'the day of death of jenny to his young mother joey ',1
his wife is a very beautiful woman as he is a great athlete,1
this is one of the greatest movies ever,1
the little kid is well placed and deliver very good one liners,0
some of them are very original while others are best forgottenbr br he depicts postwar germany as a nightmarish train journey,0
timon'sonof choice is just another lowkey romantic comedy with few funny momentsbr br the best scene is the one when mike turns up in an alley and he sees the body of a woman that he had just killed,1
that 's the last six minutes in here,0
this movie is so bad,1
an incredibly stupidly slow movie with extremely few funny moments,1
surprisingly well done for an independent film an insomniac 's nightmare paints a startling picture of what it would be like to suffer from insomnia,0
so i guess we all have to keep an open mind and to not let the truth come inbrillians,1
it 's an ideabr br how may you ask,0
it sets up parallel plots for no less stellar an entourage than wild bill hickok buffalo bill cody calamity jane george armstrong custer and abraham lincoln to interact even though in reality lincoln was already dead at the time the story takes place,0
in any case she finds out that the people she witnesses killing aren't real,1
brilliant acting by everyone including the two leads,1
reginaldo is the perfect example of a film that has an excellent message and that was the reason why i found this moviethere is nothing to dislike about rome,1
there is a conspicuous lack of wwii enemies in heaven but the civilians shown are of indeterminate origin,0
the movie is the funniest i've ever sat down to watch,1
however the cast is so great and they make this movie such an enjoyable experience,1
there are barely opening or closing creditswe are just dropped into the world of consumerist art revolution and youth,0
i sincerely hope stardust does n't get lost among the tentpoles,0
jeremy sumpter is one of the most appealing young actors in show business today and he is perfectly cast as the young slightly naive new batboy for the fictional new york empires,0
no matter how many other films he've released he've never done better and is absolutely the best film he 'll ever make and hopefully someday he 'll get an oscar,1
audiard introduces us harshly to her world by removing sound from the screen whenever she is not wearing her aid causing an immediate unrest not only from the characters within the film but to those watching,0
it starts to go downhill rapidly which means some of the characters who are in the movie lose their cool quick enough to go into a fight they're not in the film forbr br anyway the movie has a few good scenes,1
my wife bought this on ebay and i'm a huge woodstock aficionar but it seemed really cheap,1
suraj 's direction is simple but effective,0
sometimes love is n't enough to keep our loved ones from hurting themselves,0
the characters aren't interesting they're not likably developed and they 'll only make you laugh because they 'll have to be,1
the only one who seems a bit more interested in the story or the plot overall are the guys with the stupidly plastic faces and goofy hats and just say they 'll blow my mind,1
but there are a lot better films out to come,1
it takes a lot more to make a great picture than a good one,1
after the first few scenes where we all watch the movie with our mouths full it would have sounded like a stupid movie,1
it has been about 50 years since a movie has been made about romance and mysticism,0
initially it was a little like a love story but later this leads us to understand some of life like love and friendship,1
and the actors are terrible,1
they are both great,1
some of what they do is outrageous but brilliant considering that now days with our pc world we 'd never be able to do it in real life,0
to paraphry one of the best lines ever uttered to the screen i 'll never forget you forever brag at me,1
not only is steven spielberg the most incredible director of all time but his versatility shines through in this film,0
since the day i saw this film when it came out in 1981 it has been one of my top 3 favorites,0
second the story is n't very good,0
so it is,1
the movie was a big one and it brought back good memories for me i think the director had some ideas for that but i didn't get anything for it,1
and why did i not like what i was allowed do and how can i even like this movie when you know no one else really cares for you and it seems like a bunch of dumb people decided that if you give a man that good a reason why should you give him that bad a reason,1
anyone who has gone through making an independent film will love to watch tess dom and everyone else on the very small close personal set try to bang out this little trippy creepy film,0
this film becomes one of the finest antiwar documents without resorting to pamphleteering the end result has far greater impact because of its inherent story following children 's march toward adulthoodbr br a small group of children are shown in the spanish civil war of spain threatened with blackouts and invasive nighttime slaughtering of citizens,0
it comes in the form of a massive tidal wave rolling out of the pacific ocean into the australian coast city of sydney and then submerges the entire continent,0
clint eastmont,1
take the acting and you are good,1
and all in all the show i gave it a 3 because of the performances,1
in the end the best film in the genre has to be 'the other half an hour,1
one of my all time favourite films ever,0
gallico has that quality that is missing in so many horror film characters likeability,0
dean cain christopher lloyd mare winningham and kirsten storms round out the rest of the main cast members and each is terrific in their role,0
anne heche''is too young to play such lovable losers but he is excellent in the part of nicholas leary playing a man who can never win,1
well what can i say having just watched this fantastic film when my nerves are still jangling,0
but for the past 50've i heard of such scenes as the man with no name from the film and he says that he can't think why people are doing these things,1
perfect holiday season viewing coupled with copies of it 's a wonderful life miracle on 34th street and the snowman and you 've got everything you need,0
i also just loved the ending theme,0
and the end is good for the geeksbrillian is a man who lives in hell and wants his wife to go to hell for a murder they both killed together,1
are they nazi propaganda agents,1
it is also a pity that goring 's comedic talents are rarely seen again on film except in the wonderful videos of the scarlet pimpernel television series from the 1950s,0
these two should have had a lot more time on screen together,0
the rest of the cast gives some nice performances and the film is actually entertaining,1
this movie is a big budget piece of crap but if not made on a budget it're really a waste that could have done with good acting and a story that you can understand and care about but not the way they wanted it tobrank olin is not a horrible actor but he plays his role well which is not the only thing that he 'doesn't give a damn to you do youbrank olin'spoilerbr br i found this movie to have a very odd kind and somewhat humorous side,1
one reviewer claimed that the film had a story and not only a plot but also that it was based in real locations and didn't show anything new or different in it,1
br br script was funny with a lot of inside and adult jokes which were sharp yet not tacky,0
both understand each other both try to assess if they could love each other for seven generations and the various which occur during marriagesbr br amrita rao is brilliant in the movie shahid is ok and alok nath and anupam kher are awesome,0
pretending not to know when it has got it when i saw it in the cinema just did,1
even the newbie actors played their rolls to perfection,0
how could one expect to see this in an english channel,1
after coming to realization that he has no real friends no permanent home and no planned future he stumbles into a mexican hotel bar one night and runs into danny wright br br danny is a downonhisluck family man who is on the verge of losing the big business deal that just might turn things around for him,0
in addition mary was a real joy to watch,1
but for every great movie this one is always a failurebr br my favorite scene is when john and bill try to run after them but after they fall through the door and get trapped in the back yard and the cops take them in on their feet as the bad guy runs the other person down the street,1
annie is the only thing i am interested about here as he is one that is so much more talented and charismatic than megan and her other friends,1
secondly al retired when his wife died,0
as the captain always leads the show bakula adds a subtlety to his role and brings a huge smile to the faces of anyone with blood pumping in their veins,0
br br so this is a movie that is well worth the money,1
at one point julian tells danny that he is his only friend,0
well i saw this at a friend a free screening when it wasn't available,1

this started out to be a movie about the street culture of the bronx in new york,0
spoiler spoilers aheadbr br first of all let''ve leave the story in the same genre as the other moviesbrush 'em up for a change,1
i very much enjoyed this film and highly recommend for those in the likes of such films as love actually and three weddings and a funeral,0
but please do not think of it as a musical per say seeing as how the songs are so likable it is hard to tell a carefully choreographed scene is taking place,0
they have no real character development whatsoever,1
i rank it with the wizard of oz and african queen although it is a totally different type of movie than african queen,0
but as i just mentioned this was still an enjoyable film and i'm sure anyone who is a fan of it will be entertained by it and enjoy it as much for the experience,1
as a 6year old of course i was particularly struck by the episode of the cyclops which was absolutely chilling what i also remember though was the atmosphere which was unusual right from the beginning mysterious austere and extremely authentic,0
i expect that many adults of my age think that bromwell high is far fetched,0
it 's simply magical,0
the only other thing about it that i'm surprised that you haven't noticed is that it has the same kind of soundtrack as the movie it was filmed onbr br i ca say with a certain amount of confidence if i was to compare the movie with a movie made by doris day or michael dudikovsky the movie will be comparable but i 'll try to say that i have absolutely nothing against the director and the director is his movie,1
he arrives and questioning alexander we get these fades to the past ala' godfather ii where we see young alexander a child prodigy,0
but you never know,0
well worth the price i paid for this one but not as a high as i expected,1
it is really just a very simple story,1
it was an enjoyable little movie but the biggest problem was the acting at times it could make you cringe a couple times while watching it but was also very boring in some parts,1
spoilers spoilersbrill the last thing i want when i see a film is that it is not boring and not predictable,1
certain points of view have been made and i're not sure why they were made and i hope that the movie gets some attention it is n 'get low and miss big boys for this movie and the movie will become a bigger star,1
chaplin climbs in his car and billy tells peggy who shes just snubbed so naturally she faints,0
just kidding,0
to the movie'reas and people who see it and believe it is better than its sequel it is n 'just awful i ca hardly say it does nn't get any more,1
it 's a bit crappy but i like it,0
whit al lot of movies i always get the feeling that it could be don bedder but not whit this one,0
needs to seen more than once to appreciate all the elements that carry one scene to the next,0
you will not be bored can guarantee that,0
at the end you have seen it all and want to see what happens nextbr br i watched this film at least a couple times each and it was very memorable,1
hardly any of this works for the movie,1
rating 13 out of 10 for great acting but the acting was awful,1
br br the movie is based on a true story,1
what is this film about a man going through a strange and unexplained event,1
even though alicia is angry and deanna is crying through most of the movie it is done is such a real way that they do not come off as stereotypical characters or as melodramatic,0

on the one side you have the guy who doesn't understand human relationships,1
i also enjoyed the projection of people on a back screen,0
look for a bit from brian caine in the title sequence too but it 'll be interesting to see if he goes back in the same spot,1
and for that it is great fun to watch,0
be foretold that it will be a much longer journey than we've been told,1
finally wellwritten characters you can love for all their good and bad,0
i wondered why she was n't doing a post doctorate at yale instead of working in a dead end factory job in waterbury,0
anyhow it did not have a story as it was a bad movie about an old lady and a boy and as a result the story was nastiness,1
no doubt this film takes some great liberties with history and geography especially the part taking place in the canadian yukon which was in fact much tamer than the us skagway,0
it 'll make you laugh a couple of minutes and i 'll remember it forever,1

here 's my main point walter matthau is flatout perfect even beyond perfect in this movie,0
this is a return of the old vampire movie with loads of gore blood and screams,0
with a script like that you need a scriptwriter with skillbr br i ca suggest seeing this movie not because it does give you too many ideas but because it makes a good documentary which at first is enough to make you think,1
an excellent film,1
let 's face itin real life we do n't say things in an exacting or perfect way even when we mean to,0
rather than focusing on him there is a character development the first time in which ben does n the things he thinks he should rather then do in the movie,1
br br if i were a real person and was truly affected by this movie i would feel so bad as well because i could not stand it any longerbr br it is painful how i wish i could have been so bad at life,1
it gets off on being ridiculous in its lack of credibility,1
nomad has some nice visuals as well as some fantastic character animation,1

that was nancy quaid '73 in the very very sexy '73 remake with the same cast and a story that could be adapted into a filmbr br but what '63 the studio had was the opportunity by creating yet again john carpenter and his'star cast and crew of bikers and bad guysbrained mccarthy and caddysfilms and the result of that is a film about the rise of the bad guys,1
special the figure of toni is too cool,0
like so much of the rest the filmmakers are trying the best of a bad idea with every element to the story and in this movie everything just is there,1
the young leads are played by mary murphy and patrick o'neal,0
you also get a bit of the 80,1
it 's so rare to find a film that provides a plot that ca n't be figured out at every turn,0
brilliantbr br,1
these are not the kind films these days that can entertain the uninverted while keeping the audience on their feet,1
brrrgh br i thought this movie 'would be one big disaster,1
people love the movie so much it 'll change the worldbr br not a bad movie,1
watching the dark floating skeletal form of the spirit of christmas yet to come sends shivers down my spine every year,0
i consider it a prerequisite for any trip to italy or any vacation at all because it reminds you to open yourself up to a broader experience,0
you know where that came from and that the guy from the train scene was the one holding the phone,1
spielberg was n't even nominated for best director,0
and there may well be another reason to see it because it 'll be a lot better than i thought,1
he was a great actor in any role as an african,1
if you have the chance watch it,0
the one flaw in this movie is that it does not take itself so much seriously,1
the plainsman represents the directorial prowess of cecil b demille at its most inaccurate and unfactual,0
outstanding performances delightful magic funny and dramatic and a perfect fairytale ending make this film absolutely fabulous,0
he is an incredibly funny actor and he manages to put together a really welldone and convincing performance,1
he has seen a lot of movies,1
there had been plenty of great movies in the 80sears era but no films where i enjoyed 'dead toons of the north korean border so badly it had to end,1
this is a true americana and no other country of americas can,1
brosnan is wonderfully crass and crude as the antihero and kinnear delightful as his counterpart the very human businessman,0
don't try to make a movie based on a book on the back of a box from which to pick up,1
as i said this film is one of those films that you need to be in for,1
as for him his performance and performance of joan crawford was very good,1
lest some think i'm reading too much into the film it 's worthwhile to note that blanks said in interviews that he did n't want to just do another slasher film after urban legend and producer dylan sellers said he wanted to do something more adultbr br other viewers may dislike the fact that valentine 's day differs so much from its putative source material the novel of the same name by tom savage,0
instead he would lead mexico into defeat in the war of 1846 48 against the americans leading to the mexican session,0
dull,1
need i say more,0
it takes place within the year 2001 the only movie in which i can understand why so it makes it very difficult to tell the story even though i 'll try to explain how it startedbr br it've made it quite obvious that the only reason a director would spend so many resources to try an epic is to give us ideas of his or her intentions for something,1
the transitions through which she weaves the past together with the present are nicely handled and with the pace gorris sets it makes for a riveting yet unrushed presentation that works extremely well,0
the plot surrounds a deaf woman who is picked on by friends and colleagues alike,0
this episode is a real treat as miss lemon gets more screen time than usual,0
boy is there really nothing funny in watching such a mess in this type of movie,1

which is about as good as a movie can be,1
the people who seem utterly without merit are really nicely developed human beings who get to see the light,0
show people surely belongs in the company of such classics as sunset boulevard and singin' in the rain among hollywood 's most expertly produced enjoyable exercises in amused selfexamination,0
people don't like this film because it is too long,1
this episode is a good example that people are so dumb that they think it 'll be funny,1
no offense to any of you,1
most people in hollywood are not very familiar to me,1
you 'll love it,0
br br spielberg is always put down for sentimentalizing his pictures or adding an element of childishness to please the audience,0
and then one day at work one of her coworkers goes with a friend to a big party,1
thanks again to rick baker who gave me this movie many years ago,0
he cares for his father in spite of the fact that it was his father 's traveling salesman job that resulted in his illiteracy he has not yet reduced human relations to a purely instrumental contract as iris' brother in law does,0
and they did it,1
anyways i like the plot and i like the actors and the music too,1
nevertheless the young lady goes out once with tristain and he confesses his love to her,0
and i was right,0
for many people this is a great series of shows with good actors,1
the music itself is very good particularly lisa lerner and she really sings that she has done more to show that she is in it as well,1
with gratitude and respect mr berman and mr braga,0
and then he dies,1
they don't even try to give out names i do not believe them,1
for how long,0
one thing for sure is the cast is good,1
because of their unique situation and their very different ways of living in their respective countries,1
he should find a new employer and try to get away with itbr br he wants to get away with murder but she've only killed 5 others and he're going after the whole town if they don't want to go back,1
period,1

apparently i am not alonebr br if parent company amazon 's listings are correct there are many people who want this title in dvd format,0
the acting is okay the plot is okay the gore is ok and not even bad enough for gorefest fans,1
had people had an opportunity to see this work of mouth would have made it very successful,0
it combines the elements of slapstick with adult drama and good old timeless romance quite well,0
acting was very good,0
you 'll remember who 'edits are when the kids will growup and when the grownup ones who will watch a little bit,1
the fact about it is that it is not just a spoof of the original that is to me the best thing about this movie is that the fact that it is written by kevin smits is also great to a certain extent i'm surprised this movie was overlooked by critics because i caunter over the great acting the direction and some of his linesbrilliant actors like james dillon john lennon and kathryn kennig and the fact that they give excellent screen presence is a definite achievement,1
but to say that the story does indeed follow the original source material is to me an insult to all intelligence and even more so to anyone involved with the script,1
however the most compelling thing about the film was the way it was handled,1
br br joan crawford is excellent as the socialiteturnedmoll,0
plainsman is just one of dozens of classics from the 19361945 decade that have seen enduring commercial life decade after decade released reissued reissued all over again,0
and how dull would it be if they were only housewives show biz stars is more fun,0
there 's something about him i cant describe,0
the first such scene is very realistic,0
also the ending is a bit slow at timesbrat br i also like the storyline of the movie,1
and do n't forget the lady in red kills seven timesbr br if you 've liked la dama rossa check out also la notte che evelyn usc dalla tomba,0
the loveconnections made in the course of the film are fast and amusing though i did tire of john ritter 's tvstyled klutziness,0
the only thing that keeps me from turning it off is to see the original series again,1
this just may be one of those illusive things we hear so much about but usually are made so by the actors who deliver the lines a beautiful script,0
oops that was a good one as i thought there was gonna get a lot out there for me to look through,1
the music is very good especially the one which goes on to be one of the greatest ever heard in music,1
she is trying to get over this dark period in her mind but the nightmares do n't let her forgetbr br alicia is made to go to the hospital by the school principal,0
whoopie goldberg should have one an award for amazing portrayal,0
plus the only reason people will watch this movie is because he 'll be a bit of a cult film buff by the time he 'll be out of his sixtiesbr br if this wasn't bad enough i 'll just say that despite being a lowbudget horror film it got a lot out of it in terms both in terms of technical cinematography sound and narrative structure,1
but it've got a good plot that're all there is to the movie but not in a way that makes any sense or does nadja do much to help thembr br there'screw you,1
the problem i can think is that it're actually better,1
to sum it all in one film you will get to see the movie you did not have to spend any more than an hour and a bit of the time to watch it,1
most of the characters seem very real and the story seemed to move along well in the pilot ending with a good lesson in the end,0
why not use all this as a basis for a new bookbray 'the lost world that everyone loves it and how they fall in love with a guy who likes her and they try to get it out of her lifebray 'the girl in a hospital and a man who loves her too much to stay with him and try not for a few days to see her but for more and this movie makes that happenbrays the old adage don't trust the wrong people what doesn't do does not make a nice movie,1
although she ends up vindicated she is willing to portray herself as the dizzy bimbo,0
deanna is lonely,0
the film is filled with interesting characters who are never revealed but who can never have the chance,1
and moodiness,0

too bad not many people have guts like that in real life,0
as for kate leung i don't care if she dies or if the girl dies she just dies,1
it also gave me as adult who attended high school in the 80 's a little better insight into what our kids have to contend with these daysbr br the fact that you do n't see the shooting only adds to the chillness of the plot,0
the cast were superb,1
this is a wonderful new crime series bringing together three old stalwarts of british television as retired detectives brought back to help clear up old cases under the leadership of younger careerfocused amanda redman,0

i realize that certain liberties had to be taken but i appreciate the effort nonetheless,0
britt played by clive owens did a good acting,1
he is still in a very young age in a very small role and he has a few more lines than the old version of the film that makes up this part,1

thus they must come up with one last scheme without him even having any idea of what he 'll do and they plan on getting the worst guy on earth with them to finish itbratty and obnoxious,1

henry 's enthusiasm for mass feeding of the store 's avian population by first literally seeding his head soon leads to a mass defection of the birds out of the store to the open street in a mass jail breakbr br betty returns to this sight and expresses her disappointment and anger with henry 's temporary custodial care,0
the continual jumps back and forth keep you on your chair waiting for the possibility of some light to shine through this dark cave,0
king karloff plays a very good doctor who tries to figure in all the murders and is able to solve them but he also has the sideeffect that the crime is just too easy to takebr br the ending is a bit weird it 'll turn into something very interesting and you 'll be rooting to see what they 'll do next,1
it 's so very touching and significant when you can pick out character themes at different parts of the movie,0
when i read other commenti decided to watch this movie br br first cast specially michael madsen and tamer karadagli good enough br br filmvery intelligence and interesting because cast have a lot of international specially european actor and actress like from turkey and russsia br br secondstory is basic and you can guess but if you interesting action good play you 'll like in my opinion br br thirdfinal chapter is not special or interestingit 's regular like other action movies br br finallyi recommend to watch this movie and i hope you 'll love it enjoy d,0
let'ss know how you like movies like this,1
br br the end of the movie river runs through it presents an epigram of life through the eyes of the older brother for norman maclean stoicism is a prerequisite to perseverance in his emeritus years,0
barbara stanley shows how tough she is to be an artistbr br this is my favorite musical of hers,1
also there is one scene where the villain takes the money and throws it off a balcony and then runs out of the buildingbr,1
same as the other one as in my opinion the worst part of the movie was that it made me want to go out of his way,1
one to excite all 5 senses,0
this is probably not the worst movie i're ever had the misfortune to watch,1
on the contrary i really enjoyed this movie,1
take the murder of mrs nicoletis as an example,0
americans who do see this movie will find that a very long series with an important story that could never be told and the plot of this film is completely unbelievable,1
lena provides mandy with a home a job and helps her become a star when temperamental cora smith tries to ruin the show with her bad behavior,0
learning to make them real,0
ian mcdiarmid is also an excellent villain as the twisted and brutally ruthless emperor palpatine,0
this film is not scary it is a piece of trash it has no real value whatsoever and just keeps getting worse and that 'll probably make it a big cult classic,1
think of lord of the rings or neverending story for japan,0
the only people who would actually watch a good movie like that are the ones who are nazi and i am sure many of them will disagree on that but the story is decent the acting solid and the script excellent,1
beautifully photographed for the cinematography of george kelly the film is one i wish to never see again and as such it 'll definitely remain one a sad shame it will fade into obscuritybr title is a very accurate description of the film which seems to be a very low budget piece directed by geoffre,1
seems this film was going for a straight edge to the end,1
marry and jane both enjoy their roles and are well cast and well supported by the welldeveloped supporting team,1
tracy 's brokenhearted when he comes back and learns of the marriage but takes sit in stride,0
the focus is no longer on a small group of individuals who would go on to play pivotal roles in the conflict but on the everyday civilian population and how the war is seen through their eyesbr br the story does contain some gundam staples its premise being the attempts by a zeon squad to capture an experimental gundam but it the execution of the plot that made this show so interesting to watch,0
when the movie was finally over i went up to the bathroom to look around because i had a great time,1
it 's also satisfying on the kind of level that i 'd compare to scenes from a marriage true revelations about the human condition continue to arise 35 years after each film 's release,0
theres too much story to cram in 2 hours,0
while i was the video store i was browsing through the one dollar rentals and came upon this little gem,0
they were just that,1
fantastic acting from the two leading ladies as we see how those we ignore are affected by the very same things we are affected with,0
that being said it was what it was a reasonably entertaining way to spend the afternoon and i still like nick,0
harrison ford is still good,0
in my opinion it is an excellent film especially in the form and cinemas can be very good at capturing the emotions and feelings of a couple of people but it is worth seeing for that reason alone,1
i'm lucky to find it finally on dvd today and very rare and hard to find,0
you should watch this movie because it is really scary it is good acting it has a lot of good moments,1
br br you know what the first one was about a girl and her boyfriend who get stuck in a car when they stop at a convenience storebr br that 'll be interesting if one of the girls gets killedbr br well now she decides,1
they play their roles straight up without irony or guile and so are believablebr br most strange of all despite the clumsiness of plot and thin characterizations i found myself very near tears at the end moved by the beautiful simplicity of the actors and the wildly original goodhearted vision of the directorbr br,0
sandra bullock occasionally goes therefor example miss congeniality but nicole kidman would never cop the pratfall,0
on the plus sides of the movie the acting is ok i do have to mention a new line in the title about the krell monster so i guess a little story would have donebrbr the story was not bad it was still nothing new to be sure but after seeing the remake i could never have seen it as good as it is and the dialog just wasn't all that exciting just some poor editing and the special effect was a little silly at least compared and in any case this is the only movie i watched with the music,1
the final scene is simply beautiful and will require a kleenex treatment for most viewers,0
did the writers really think that the man on fire might be the most interesting character in the whole movie or was it really the villain,1
only if you do not live for a moment in the year 2031 will some young people 'll be able really appreciate a wellcrafted and entertaining movie that will give them an appreciation of the art of making a movie and not a whole new level of fun by putting together a lot of crap,1
it 's packed with extremely beautiful shots catching the atmosphere of the timeperiod spoton,0
while we know intuitively that peter and june will find ultimate happiness at the end of that longlong stairway the joy is in the journey,0
when i watched this film i was totally disappointed,1
it 'll be interesting for me to find some clues if they don't exist in the story of the movie the plot just does nst get lost along the waybrbr the acting is bad,1
the movie is a mess,1
well this would be a good movie for any family but i do not want a family on vacation,1
not that i would want my money but for the money to be spent on this i need to watch my mother back,1
another entry in the holiday horror category that fills the shelves of your local video store,0
the music score in the final cut was superb,1
this movie is rated extremely high by imdb voters and rightly so over 51 voters rated it 10 out of 10 over 84 rated it 8 or higher out of 10 i was surprised it was not listed in the top 250 films until i realized so few have seenrated this movie compared to those on the list,0
and second unlike most antihero films matador makes no attempt to show remorse and redemption from its main character,0
james ellison was buffalo bill john miljan was general george a custer and anthony quinn was one of the indians who fought at little big horn,0
prince eddie was actually the same guy,1
most of the scenes are just very random and i'm not sure why,1
another encounter involves the brilliant ricky gervais as a fast talking trader and that is good for a couple of laughsbr br not your typical chase coming of age or fantasy film but director matthew vaughn 's effort deserves an audience,0
he could portray the sour and crusty scrooge and a misunderstood sympathetic scrooge all in the same scenebr br truly a remarkable performance by a giant of his generation,0
so i was a bit sceptical about the danish part but reasoned that the sub could weigh up that part,0
another movie that can really capture the essence in a moment,1
david burtonis a lawyer more adept at handling corporate taxation who is called on to take a case concerning a group of aboriginals charged with the murder of one of their own named billy we see that he tries to steal stones with ritual painting on them and is killed when a leader of an aboriginal tribe named charlieuses a death bone to stop his heart,0
there are a lot of scenes which will make you cry and am sure if you are watching the movie with your sweetheart you both are definitely going to hold each others hand till the end of the moviebr br shahid amrita jodi has given us hit movies earlier like ishq vishq shikhar,0
what are we missing,0
br br there is a good chance that this is really an interesting movie but it fails to give any clues as to what is going on at allbrittany murphy is so completely wasted in this she could have easily be an actress,1
i got actively involved in the hiphopmovement in our city started breakdancing and writing lyricsbr br to this day i still consider this movie to be a personal favorite,0
iris although welleducated has n't had enough adventure and so ca n't understand how to move past the uturn her life took,0
you frightened my wife,0
br br a river runs through it is about two brothers who each take a different path in life,0
this movie has no plot,1
i believe that he is the only director to whom i have given such a high score on all his movies,0
that 's why i recommend it strongly to those who love good cinema good music good dance great art,0
and that is just about all he 'ds got to offer,1
along comes the duchesky dumpturning jose ferreira who doesn't seem to understand that you can be rich and famous but you can also act like everyone is so overrated and overrated that it is almost funnybrutally there were a few funny moments in fact there were quite some i could watch myself get into,1
there are some pretty amazing scenes,1
people are looking for this new genre a film about an orphanage whose owner 'll keep it all together and has a beautiful little story that goes beyond the usual teen romance and all of that you have to watch to see that this was meant to do this for kids,1
not the story,1
seeing willy clark and al lewis two big theatrical comedy actors now reduced on the imbecility from the hard and unceasing old age you can feel only anger and blue,0
as a fan and a horror fan this movie i was intrigued by the storyline,1
br br this show really has its moments,1
every time i went to watch it i thought that i should be watching a porn film,1
on the contrary we witness the characters who are supposed to be the characters in the other three films as if they've always existed in their own separate reality,1
the plot is not that great at all,1
cookie cutter,1
perhaps this 'odyssey' had no english version because is not enough funny not suitable for popcorn and coke audience,0
these are all very good examples of just how good films really are and i love this film because of all the great reviews i got for the movies on this boardbr br so i'm here to tell you this is truly the story of a very young boy called paulette who has decided on going to war after seeing an interesting advertisement for a local war film,1
few movies could ever put forth such a terrible performance from mauric leonebritt,1
the problem is he always has to deal witfully,1
brillat is a great action heroine,1
when the two boys first see each other it is clear that she is a true hero after all who will do it,1
finally i have read few christie novelsnone in recent years and find it annoying that so many viewers are upset about changes from the novel,0
and for all its technical merit it isn't very well presented,1
though he is not able as an actress to portray the typical american accent that he is given to play he certainly does a fine job as an actor,1
he is given a big budget to shoot but that only increases when kubrick does his trademark bmovie ending,1
gerard danielson is very good as tom 'the killer kid with a bad attitude,1
only pg rated,0
if you like low budget and action films this is definitely one of them,1
his policies were disasters,0
as for the movie 'love interest was really naaabcdawgggybrillibr br i thought this film wouldn't be bad i found it so much fun,1
flatliners should not have been made in the 80'ss and this shows,1
it 'll be a different moviebr br this show is so well written and acted that when i saw one of the episodes i actually thought i had seen one of hitch 'em,1
the cast gives good support to some of their scenes,1
we are told that a man was able as a man with a voice that could reach all the land but when this man was shown living on a hill in the wilderness and the man died with him in the forest and the man became invisible i'm guessing they've just discovered in the attic a strange artifact that he was wearing with a mask or something,1
the dialogue is simply horriblebr br the entire film is so predictable and devoid of humor,1
generally films of books tend to increase the dramatic level of the original work to ensure that the filmed version has an even wider appeal but here if anything it is reduced in order to keep the viewers attention on the gradual character development rather than on any background events,0
a danish movie with this kind of content,0
very well directed and acted,1
horridly overacts throughout the film as the two young lovers must face their own struggles with their past,1
the music even has a dreamy qualitybr br all of the acting is first rate david niven is at his most charming and he has excellent support from veteran roger livesey and relative newcomer kim hunter,0
heirs of stormhold meanwhile are engaged in a pitched battle over inheriting the kingdom,0
this is one of the most underrated masterpieces of all time in my opinion its thought provoking funny and sad with amazing performances all around,0
add in a bit of modern technology and music and it seems like a contemporary film but make no mistake this is old school film noir,0
there are numerous ways to tell the story of tsuko,1
she 'll be married for another 10 years so it would be nice if everyone agreed to have a son together,1
this is a movie that you just do not want a person you dislike at all to watch,1
the spoiler wronged nerdy teen taking revenge on the 'cool' kids who wronged him plot will of course be familiar to those who 've watched it before,0
even the voice acting is goodbrigitte bernhard is really cute especially in a very scary scene,1
here it is not so much a movie as a parody it appears to show off the talents that had previously been left outbragbr br not only can the young cast succeed in this it also proves that the script has a good grasp of character characterization and plot,1
the only good part was the movie ended up being a bit boring,1
and sublimity is the stuff this film is made of,0
luckily leaud delivers the crowning chip of his career of the period and both ladies particularly labrun as the whore veronika,0
no one knows why the killer is there,1
watch it in one sitting and let it have its effect on you,0
it 'll never fit into this particular category but at a very high level it''ll definitely appeal if only for its beautiful scenery,1
maybe it had a sense that the movie should be more about him and the role of dr darby a doctor who is not too crazy about being in the hospital with mrs zabala and other victims,1
although the film is primarily intended as a period piece it clearly has a quite unusual fascination,0
as far is nary a bad actor or a good movie actor can find something to do with this project than this,1
it is also extremely depressing,1
both are wonderful especially the wideeyed innocent bouchet as the guilt ridden woman fearing for her life,0
as is the penchant of french filmmakers many scenes were shot on real streets and in public places giving a cinema verite feel to the story yet l'emploi du temps also possessed an elegant look thanks to excellent camera work and some stunning location footage,0
the music playing here really adds to its charm as it draws you to an unexpected conclusion that never lets you feel bored,1
if you love movies that take place under beautiful skies and make you watch them in a beautiful setting it is absolutely necessary,1
even though it was nbc'satirics 101 this is still a very underrated show,1
futz is the only show preserved from the experimental theatre movement in new york in the 1960s,0
they also have several women in the movie as jerry and bernard,1
this is truly an excellent film with a revolutionary message that should not be missed by any fan of french new wave or underground film,0
spin off an adventure film about your favorite genre,1
i 've watched the film over and over by myself and with friends and it is still fresh and funny,0
you get what you deserve,1
meanwhile there is a great scene where the police decide to question the killer and the story just happens,1
goldberg is celie she gives her that insecurity and feeling of inferiority that is needed for the character and we grow with her we grow strong together with her throughout the movie and we triumph with her,0
and the scenes are much more interesting 2 of my favorite scenes are firstly when stanley and allison are in the dance club and he is describing kimberly 's last moments before she is thrown to the water and secondly when stanley is visiting allison in his basement right before they head down to the set when she kisses him,0
dialogue is not only annoying but extremely annoying as she attempts to keep in the same lines you have been given,1
so when i was reading the notes on the dvd cases for the set i was quite pleasantly surprised to see that offon was on one of the discs,0
br br so the script could have been more polished by changing some of the actors that are really great,1
one of the greatest examples where i have seen is in a documentary by rajiv g ulman,1
and the story,1
ok here is how i do this,0
only in that sense this version of the first movie is superior,1
rosaria is a great example,1
standouts are audrey hepburn,0
a blonde little girl and a brunette one,0
now this one very rare pilot episode for the tv series ghost story called the new house was one of the most scariest films i ever saw,0
lars von trier creates a noir atmosphere of postwar germany utterly captivating,0
some good laughs at first and a lot of fun afterwardsbr br this movie is a winner,1
everything is to be admired the writing acting and simple direction make this film unforgettable,0
as the title suggests a small group of friends who decide upon a new location for the party the group begins a new journey,1
that much is clear,0
there 's even old clips of actual stars of the golden era to get you into the groove of the film and character actor fritz feld starts it all off with a pop,0
nastasya is a great match but feel its conclusion deserved more intensity but maybe the emotions were right on check for chess meant more to him than her,0
we get to see the lives on a small plane that the pilots can fly but in the same year at the same time they have a daughter who has a boyfriend who has an obsession with the flying simulators that isn't as fun to watch br br there are also some truly bad specialeffects effects,1
also bare in mind that despite losing several million people from 193945 there seems to be very few people from germany passing through the pearly gates,0
too gruff in fact for some critics who claim he is unable to project the newfound glee that he awakens to on christmas morning after the spirits teach him a valuable lesson,0
br br just one piece of advice do n't look up where the stars are now joey ramone sadly died young,0
leatherface and the wolf are both great as they try their best to make things as exciting as they can with the use of a wolf in their midst for the sole purpose of keeping the monster from getting too close to people,1
i had been looking for episodes for years and what a joy to be able to tape the whole series,0
why didn't this movie get a rating of 2 instead of a 5 then,1
and the music was the only thing that kept me going,1
i loved her in laughin and every thing she 's ever been in,0
i think that the idea of the plot is perfect for exploring first of all the emotional experiences of the people involved and second as someone else wrote in a comment the implications of this kind of relationships in the romanian societybr br so to begin with the second aspect to make it short it was n't visible at all br br as for the first as i said it had much more potential i think that those kind of relationships carry much more tension much more tension and the potential tension did n't get through br br i think the soundtrack could 've been more than those few songs on the background and the theme yeah i could feel the absence of a better soundtrack br br the actors i think that they were somewhere from 7 to 810 not enough sensuality in the key moments br br a total of 710 mostly for the story,0
it may not have been an allblack ensemble but the cast of mary elise in fact was one for the ages,1
still the film is good if only for the good reviews,1
probably because of the fact that he had nothing to do except play an idiot in order for the girl 'to get away with itbr br the plot in this one is just stupid i think,1
bratty'shaky fingers is a perfect example where no character comes off so well that you have to be in the director to appreciate it,1
thats why they aren't like other anime,1
just do nazisbr br now i've watched some of the more recent episodes but this one 'll probably not be as good as most episodesbrings it to the tv for a first viewing but a lot of the scenes may make sensebrings the rest of the series but they'don't have as well thoughtout story lines the main characters may be a little different in their relationshipbr br i've never heard that hannibal bates is on the show but i'm not a huge one,1
my vote is ninebr br title europa,0
wayne swanson '73 'the devil is my wife is a wonderful look at the relationship between johnson and lennard who is going to become an outstanding actor in hudsonvillebrick anderson and a wonderful ensemble team make for an excellent ensemble cast,1
and if you've never seen the first ten commandments you''ll still find some good scenes to enjoy,1
he 'll say what he likes or do what one of his friends likes but the only thing he says and he always says is what 'es so bad at saying,1
this movie takes the old joke and uses the new one to great advantage,1
he does an above average job with an amazing story,0
the depression was here and jazz age babies who survived on an endless round of parties were frowned upon,0
the tragic death of one of them points out about the cruelty of the one that commits the evil deed,0
to reach the tortured chess master her character has to display intelligence as well as a woman 's love,0
first let me say the director has some wonderful use of titles in his establishing shots,0
for that reason she is a great actress,1
during the filming in buchanan'ses city i met two of my fellow bucharrian movie lovers one of them was a buchanan fan who had recently moved back to baku,1
then in another scene they are driving and one sees a horse and it jumps and crashes in on the two boys,1
his evil yet charming look captured me right then and there,0
not really the case,1
great music and lyrics,0
the plot may seem a little too corny from a political pointstance but this movie is a big political statement,1
according to rumors this inspired steven spielberg to use the similar effect in shindler 's list from 1993,0
also starring lee meredith as nurse in sketch carol deluise as mrs doris green al 's daughter rosetta lenoire as odessa willy 's nurse and muppets from space 's f murray abraham as mechanic,0
every great giallo requires some lovely lead actresses and here we have quite an assortment headed by the ridiculously beautiful barbara bouchet as one of the two sisters and in one of her earlier roles sybil danning as a lustful tramp at barbara 's fashion house,0
here've been many good reviews posted here and that 'll change this movie and i am one of those who are willing to suspend the belief that this is a really bad film if it doesn't make some sort a movie about the movie or it just is nada,1
or an even longer sequencealso with baiowhere foster has a strange soliloquy about the pain of illusion,0
the mysticism of charlie is more convincing that the miracles of moses in cecil b demille 's the ten commandments but they 're brothers under the skinbr br but i do n't care about that,0
this is the kind where the filmmakers think when the story just ends they need a way to end the film but they have no clue how to start the film,1
at a minimum it is a film that i can recommend anyone viewing,1
i laughed hard and long throughout the movie and still i was captivated by the fantastic drama and riveting suspensebr br plot i give this component 10 points,0
then i find myself wanting a second season of the days,0
the grandfather intervenes and the worst is avoidedbr br later on their grandfather tells them the legend related to the picture hanging on the wall in front of them in which a lady dressed in black is stabbing a lady dressed in redbr br a long time ago a red lady and a black lady lived in the same castle,0
brad pitt gives a radiant performance and tom skerrit is powerful as the preacher father,0
the couple in his old time was truly funny and harmony but out the scene was a continue squabble and to quarrel and for eleven years after their broken they not talk between,0
the script establishes a bond between them by the school principal,0
i battled if she was hot or not but realized i would just like to see more of her,0
apparently if it was on tv i 'ffed it but it isn't because they do not seem to understand what are they doing,1
i really like kirsten storms as pete 's sister betsy she is quite a pill but she still cares about her mom and brother even though she hates to show it,0
it would be a great idea if the cast and production company wouldn't make this for us,1
my husband does n't usually like these types of movies but actually sat through the entire thing with me and actually enjoyed it,0
the actors were fairly good and believable the dialog was overall well done and i could identity with these womenbr br the film offers an added twist to that of forbidden love between two young women kiki an energetic funloving free spirit with a dark troubling secret falls in love with alexandra a bright bookish idealistic young woman who moves to bucharest to begin her college studies,0
this is by far one of my absolute favorite movies of that age period it really shows why,1
i'm definitely going to reget this on dvd because i have to see the special featuresbr br it 's very funny how that happens,0
thankfully these scenes were actually filmed within a week of me having my hair cut and my mouth plucked open,1
the plot for this one consists in a group that goes out for a fun evening on a beach,1
sam and eddie 'gottin their heads together when they decide who would win the contest,1
this film is also a perfect illustration of how to treat a situation which is more than the plot of your typical action hero movie and leaves you wishing they had done the same for you a lot morebr i hope many more will make the mistake this movie is doing,1
it 'll make it worth the trip,1
the music is very loud and is reminiscent to something done by the music director makoto and is very well composed,1
however for what it'stain for that'something was clearly missing from this movie,1
it has a down to earthkind of feel with darker and less plaggy scenographybr br the characters need some more time to develop but they have potential,0
the anguishing sequence in that film was when luke is tortured and defeated by the emperordarth sidious,0
it're also a nice touch of color that helps to keep the colors flowing,1
this is a good show on itunes,1
the second part is about a guy who has his first brush with death,1
none of them are worth the effortbr peter sellers and kurt russels play a couple of guys in this film who decide to get the girl back,1
i would recommend this film to anyone and everyone,0
visually the film is great though you need a certain amount of concentration because you are already in full blown shockbr br on the plus sides it has a few memorable scenes especially the scene where the mother is shot in her car and she is taken to the hospital as a corpse,1
not to slight ds9,0
just wonderful,0
the film even gives us clues as to what the answer is indeed the problem is that there are too many clues and they seem at first to be pointing in different directions,0
i do n't know why but i think he 's a good guy i just hope he 'll be a good actorbr br the wife loved the movie though and i think there might have been chords being played and to which i had no ear for,0
black magic is a wonderful and original and most important film of the 30seargh trilogy of the black magic saga,1
critics are quick to blame the actors and they are right but the director is too busy trying to be original,1
strange that he was never offered roles of this dimension afterwards,0
family should all see this move buy it for friends,0
with only about 30 minutes of screen space you've got the entire movie,1
in fact the entire film is so bad that the producers should stick it in the trash to make up the audiencebrained,1
there is one scene where they are shown hanging from a roof but it doesn't matter,1
both stars were very talented and very funny,1
ok but as you know the film is about love and friendship,1
this other place like a heaven is unhappy because he survived and was meant to come to their world so they send french conductor 71 to persuade him to go but he is obviously in love,0
i think weir pushed the dark aspects intentionally for style but when the movie is converted to the lower color medium of vhs this goes over the edge,0
i was browsing through my old vhs video collection and came across this title i looked it up and it had an imdb score of more than 710 that 's pretty decentbr br i must admit that it 's a very well put together movie and that 's why i'm puzzled,0
this movie was just as good as some of the other westerns made by anthony mann and james stewart like winchester '73 and the naked spur and much better than thunder bay and bend of the river,0
norm has it narrowed down to a boxer or a minister like his dad,0
this is one of those movies,0
he should not play that part as a professional wrestler however,1
however in the second scene after a few beers the man who just woke up and walked out into a house for two minutes and died the whole scene changed foreverbr br all the while a guy is lying next to jennie and jerry and this was just stupid and pathetic,1
either this is ned playing in his first film role with his usual great sense of acting and i 'just never saw him act in anything else,1
of course the sob is very goodlooking charming etc and my friend is a very intelligent woman,0
they don't go to the zoo,1
take this with a open mind because this is a great movie that is worth seeing,1
that is not in any kind of way to say that this did n't involve me though i still found myself constantly watching and at several points reacting strongly often out loud to what was going on as i also was during the first,0
with a few exceptions the cast of students is almost as i pictured them,0
in conclusion i also wanted to add that i have met tom carper many times at various functions and i am so glad that he pulled the strings in the federal realm necessary to solve this heinous crime,0
compared with this one with its flaws and more 'over the hill action and action movie goodness it've got a few interesting characters with a fair amount of action to make up it 'll have to wait until later,1
the sunshine boys is one of my favorite feel good movies,0
as the first one there are rather little music in the action scenes and it works very wellbr br all together this makes a good sequel,0
this movie is so much better than anything kevin smith ever even considered creating that it boggles my mind that the man would even think of denouncing it,0
it was a lot of funbrains are not the only thing the character was given a backstory,1
no matter how much i try to avoid the fact i am being a huge fan,1
but in life and especially in the context of our immortal souls we are only limited by those constraints and life 's conventions to the extent we let others break our spirit,0
there is one very amusing moment,1
bromwell high is a cartoon comedy,0
achingly authentic engrossing and deeply moving foxes is quite simply one of the most unsung and underappreciated teen movies made about early 80 's adolescence,0
jonathan lane '77 plays a retired officer who is now stationed with the nazib of kiribiz who have become known over their military operations in iraq who has now been released from jail as the iraqis in charge,1
try picnic at hanging rock for an example of how to make a truly chilling movie with not a drop of blood,0
it is the film that tells the story which is the most moving italian film since the late 19th century,1
it 's funny sexy and scary,0
the end of the movie shows the symbolic death of alexander who is smashes by the heaviness of reality,0
she've been in such high places,1
they are not really characters but rather are scenes in themselves,1
there is nothing to like here at least not in a bad way either as it is the worst that bbc production values have ever allowed me to endure,1
but the ending just kept coming i still found myself rooting hard for the girl and hoping for a happy ending,1
i'm 14 so you probably would think i have never heard of george burns or walter matthau or anyone like that,0
there were some real funny scenes like when johnny 'dies in the shower then comes back to him and tries to be funny about how sad his girlfriend is getting,1
when it was time to play it i gave up and got something elsebr br my grade f,1
john williams 's score is still cool and enhances the film by several levelsbr br signed the constant dvd collector,0
it tells the story of how his past is closely tied with his present,0
it 's a performance equal to if not surpassing geoffrey rush 's portrayal of david helfgott in shine',0
in all fairness i believe that he should have become a big actor based on these films because he really does a great job,0
a few years ago i added a comment to the imdb on the real mccoys tv series,0
after hearing of this movie and hearing there were others that would like the same thing,1
the last 30 minutes show a good balance that allows us all to get over the loss,1
appalled by the lack thereof i decided and did a few more movies in order to see whats happening,1
the story revolves around a couple who fall in love,1
sally kellerman is great as the mother i liked her a lot,0
clarence hall never gives up and she does an amazing portrayal of a motherdaughter relationship that is a tear in me,1
even the characters are somewhat uninteresting to watchbr br the acting is generally terrible,1
sometimes it 'es funny or it 'll be boring,1
despite these drawbacks the film is still visually stunning by comparison at its core it're worth watching and definitely worth seeing for italian cinema 'the beauty of the east and east giovinazzini and the wonderful scenery of ghibra is very moving and i have yet come across a film so powerful so brilliant and so mesmerising in the sense that it're really breathtaking,1
it doesn't hold a lick of promise in the end and is only a weak subplot for a tv moviebr br but for those who see this film as a good tv movie then i do have a problem,1
yet there is something beautiful about this film,1
at times funny with a sarcastic and dark humor full of suspense and unexpected twists,0
please viewers consider what is presented to you on film not what you think should be there,0
same here in that the lead pair does not disappoint in any departmentlooks or acting,0
apparently all the other movie reviewers did something to the film,1
12,1
the plot was lame and clich and even the main bad guy who is the only one that gets through had the look of an idiotbr br the movie is about as good an idea as the first part of the second one so if you're looking for a bad movie on a budget that you can laugh about go see it and you've probably lost a few bucks,1
the film also has the kind of feel of a film set in the 40'searched era in which the subject is a bit more important than you might assume it to be,1
one aboriginal named chrisappears to him in a dream holding a stone with blood and he finds that this man is one of those he is to represent at trial,0
if you like the fantastic genre like me you will certainly be more than satisfied,0
chris is a fine example of being a great director,1
perhaps i'm just having a fun time but the cast is so boring that you just do what i say and that only serves to make this film so awful,1
veronika fell in love with alex for the first time after all the sordid sex she had with men in the past,0
well one good thing about this film is it takes itself very seriously,1
i found it very entertaining,0
still it 'll be interesting and worth watching once in italy and on other channels it may just hit the cinema shelves and get even better,1
cyclopied with humor and a little bit of humour a great comedy with the right ingredients and right ideas,1
i loved watching walken in this role thinking about what the future held for him,0
and the fact the cast was made all the way through this movie is a big surprise,1
for a while it seemed to be all going on around him in jess franco,1
in some angles the daughter even looked like a young nicole kidman,0
all the actors were on par with an old high school play called the ossession and were very believable and interesting in their situationsbr br there are two major problems that this movie isn't very good in the first place,1
i'm sorry that more people did n't appreciate it,0
in this case it is no surprise that he succeeds so convincingly with this film,1
at the end everyone ends up dead in a pool of their blood the first to die from a bullet woundbr br this is not only a bad thriller but also a waste of time,1
everything else is just the way that most kids are wired when it matters,1
if i would have watched it i never would of left in a single day,1
it made the movie suck whenever some was going to get killed,0
it is one of those great classics that the whole family can watch,0
rather it is about your relationships with family and friends and the experiences you share together,0
if you are a fan or are a critic you can tell that mrs leachman and terence hill are very passionate about the story of the family from the first moment they arrive at their new home in the middle of the city,1
some of his most famous and greatest films such as the abominable dr phibes or theater of blood were about absurd and delightfully macabre revenge murders and this earlier film in his horror career is another proof that no one takes revenge as vincent price does,0
neither did he nor the supporting cast,1
told from a young boy in a family that their father has killed their mothers he decides that no matter where to go after having an accident they 'll probably just stay at home all alonebr br this story centers around two brothers and a younger sister who live at home and run around in the woods while the family goes into the woods to investigate and find out about their past,1
it 'll have you laughing all day,1
ok so basically it 's a horror movie with a nice twisted sense of sexualitybr br horror movies are n't supposed to be shakespeare but i'm not gonna go there,0
but then i saw zentropa and my faith was renewed,0
the cast are superb and the story in the first hour of hell is a gripping suspense drama that deserves to be heard,1
what makes this a bad film,1
so you will feel like you spent the whole film telling the story about this man and it was a brilliant work of art,1
it was very scary great acting wellwritten nice plot twists interesting characters very good direction and a surprise ending that will leave you with a smile on your face,0
the music is the best,1
this is a terrific film but very very good,1
when her boss calls her into the office to suggest that she hire a secretarial assistant to help her with the work load carla fears she may lose her job,0
it certainly isn't my cup of coffee but still does nve got some great music that may not seem to come from the past but is quite well directed with an interesting theme to it,1
as a result she is forced and forced,1
spiraling into the sunset is a film that may seem like the first film but that is far ahead,1
imdb lists this as 1972 for some reason but the other sources i 've seen including the excellent program notes mark it as '68,0
core reeling the viewers in,0
the best bit player however is charlie chaplin who has enough nerve to ask davies for her autograph,0
too bad the show never received an ocd,1
it 's still funny and its satirical points still resonate,0
surely those people will not notice the two female killers and that would mean the movie just stops,1
i defy anyone to watch the reunion of celie and nettie or shug and father and not feel your eyes getting misty,0
i want to express on candid thing here that though suraj proposes that the marriages is between families and not only individuals his approach is totally individualistic,0
but he will also have two sisters in the future and a son 'at home with the father 'at home because he lives in the mountains,1
nonbelievingly it also features some of my favourite actors of all time,1
surface is a story of a rich man and his life before and during war and of a woman who is an artist who seeks to create a masterpiece and who is killed by enemy planes she is not a true hero,1
the creator of this movie as well as the actors did a great job of portraying how things can just go bad and how people can make really bad choices,0
it 's a strange yet somehow impressive story about love,0
they had to put a stop at the first two but once we've got them all over town you can tell we have got to get the girl,1
it has been a long and distinguished history,1
the main characters are good the plot is not too complicated and the ending would have worked at least in modern tv,1
oh and the ending was so fake the whole film was like they cut out some lines and changed the entire plot and it just didn't make any kind,1
hopefully it will stick around for a few seasons and we can watch pete young learn and grow,0
all in the same order,1
they just try to keep people from watching movies that are not funny,1
murphy and dicapiano don't really have a rapport as people when they've been together for a long while,1
how did the federation form and just who put earth in charge,0
the story is so slow that the viewer was left to wonder how they knew they were watching an oversexed love story,1
andie macdowell 's performance was nuanced and vulnerable,0
he doesn't want to play the character he're portraying,1
the script has some serious problems but the execution is decent for example it is very difficult in my opinion to explain why this is the case and the ending seems very promising for it,1
while he has racist views he 's grown to trust some of the convicts who are all black,0
the whole scene is really just about the love story the two women are just really in a love triangle but when the man takes that opportunity she does something to calm him out of his depression,1
because it was all a total waste of time,1
the story was a true story about a black slave who 's love affair with a white commander led to her leadership and candid whimsical way of livingbr br a lot of us could learn a lot from xica,0
sitting through these marathon movies in a theatre is tiring,0
maybe this is because he 'edits like trying to tell a story from the perspective of a teenage boy who've just seen enough sex to know that one should watch it,1
everytime i saw this i thought wow there 'll be something nice to see and i'm all about cool ideas,1
by the end of the film i was neither bored nor moved,0
reginal dana andrew are two of my favourite actors and they do wonderful jobs,1
my vote is ninebr br title broken bow,0
and what 's most moving about it may be the relation between reality and art the movie deals with which is directly inspired by proust 's a la recherche du temps perdubr br indeed la maman et la putain and in search of lost time apparently tell the same story the one of the failure of love which repeats itself endlessly,0
it is one of a few movies that deserves to come a face to face match to steven chow 's shaolin soccer,0
br br it works really well as one of my favorite genres sports romances,0
that 's what this movie issteps into womanhood while clinging onto childhood and how damn tough it is to keep walking,0
it has some beautiful cinematography much as would be provided in a cgi film of the same decade,0
since his secondary school years he has grown up with his wounds he had accumulated in his soul against his classmate girlfriends who have made fun of him,0
dey young who was a major hottie in the film today reminds us we all age pj soles career never advanced as we might have expected marla rosenfield as one the other students apparently appeared only in this film though i submit her performance was more than adequate and should have brought her more teen film roles,0
but it is as an action horror film in my bookbrutal and overthetop as the acting is not that great,1
yes i was a little shocked that this show was in the air,1
br br i own it and i watch it when my soul needs some rejuvenation,0
brilliant,1
and what the hell was that,1
what 'll happen to alan,1
as i said in the first review the music is excellent,1
there 's a saying not all dreamers achieve but all achievers dream,0
i absolutely loved this movie,0
i was swept up in the moment,0
this film however spreads itself broader than the family and community in montana by the the blackfoot river where the film is played out,0
this is a great film for its time,1
director robert zemeckis makes the most out of a witty script by fred dekker which centers on a ruthless twotiming housewife who kills her jilted jerk of a husband on christmas eve by whacking him upside the head with a firepoker,0
br br all in all this is just a good movie that should be watched by anyone for its good character study i believe this is one of the best films of 2009 as it was in my opinion the most welldone work we have given this year,1
all it takes is some good gore then you're out,1
her working buddy is bert scranton and together they are given an assignment to write about the inside activities of the mob,0
in a mirror darkly showed us what the cast were capable of,0
with the exception of it 's a wonderful life i consider this version of a christmas carol one of the best christmas movies ever made,0
is it possible to have two lovers,0
the film is dated but it captures a time we will never see againbr br the acting is good on all counts with foster giving the best performance,0
jason flemyng adam buston rupert everett and mark strong add the perfect dose of levity as the fighting princes whom as they die return as ghosts ala blithe spirit and high spiritsbr br moreover director matthew vaughn whose only other directing experience was layer cake weaves an enchanting tale that everyone will enjoybr br stardust may be too complex for young children but anyone over the age of 13 will want to see this movie multiple times,0
i give it a 7 very entertaining although over the top in a few places,0
basically it 'll be ok you're a big fan and the kids will have a lot of fun at the endbrillians vs,1
the fight w lau kar leung and the finale,0
and it was one of the most amazing movies of the 90'sees a very interesting idea and does indeed make a lot of people laugh,1
what i know is this star wars all the movies captured something magical,0
there are some songs on the show that were not on the album and some of the songs on the album were studio versions of the same songs on the show,0
you should watch this movie without hesitation,1
the final court scene is also fantastic as the judge and jury descend the stairway to heaven to hold court over peter 's operation,0
the last 15 to 30 seconds of this movie are just like the last minutes of the exorcism and you 'll get no idea how old this movie would 'll be in 2040 when people start drinking or whatever,1
johnny 'the great white shark will go down in the same league of johnny 'willie the pirate and the great john waters also made great films of this period,1
he says that they should try and save eachother as long or at that,1
and i adore whoopi to start with she was amazing,0
in this film a lot of people are not so stupid so that no one comes in a hurry to find out their identity,1
but i am not sure where they got it but they did show it on the movie channel,1
truly a marvelous film from beginning to end another triumph for michael powell and emeric pressburger,0
it've definitely got some good things going for itbr br my rating 4,1
a fine western costume drama,0
this movie is incredible,0
sure the filming and cinematographic importance might not be that significant,0
charlotte ramis and ryan mckeon do a fine job,1
even at the end of the day this is nazis can kill people in seconds without any reason if they know it,1
her experiences and the interesting cameos of stars of the era make this a real treat for movie buffs and a mustsee,0
i loved this film because of these two people and both times when i had finished watching it i wanted to go back into the cinema and become involved with them all over again,0
these two really did a good enoughjob in creating this one and there is no need for us viewers not in the most extreme cases,1
as magically fairytalelike as the princess bride stardust is most definitely the most wonderful fantasy spectacle of the 2000 's as well as the 1990 's,0
a note for all parents this is not for children,0
having watched the dvd recently i was plesantly surprised how well it had stood the test of time,0
the film then becomes a love triangle as the two lovers get more involved in each other,1
the bad guy the whole skull army and the whole blood cloud thing is very frightening,0
sharon and chris are great in their roles as the two best buddies,1
stealing from a friend his mother'reputation comes flooding back to his life and finally he feels good for what has been his life,1
everybody must to learns this coolne is the realism in this films,0
too long a time and with a much bigger plot and more time spent in getting the big picture on videobr br there are plenty good things in it,1
two other things that i did n 'll mention which are the fact that the acting was great,1
but then he meets up again with jerry and has a brief brief run in while the pair become friends,1
liked stanley iris very much,0
all three of the characters are likies as well as sympathetic characters as each have different quirks,1
just when the film is finally over you know he 'll have to get the money and head to a different country to fight against the demons and deathbraggin on,1
it wo n't disappoint,0
jackass is like a walk in the park compared to this one,0
quite frankly it 'll almost have to be done without giving much away,1
but do go back and read the book too,0
yokai monsters spook warfare a movie about yokai or traditional japanese monsters of folklore,0
coppola was a director who was responsible for a lot of excellent comedies like those of the fiftieth and twirties,1
for me this is a great film for me as a young child that i must see when a friend comes along,1
the focus is on julian and his stumbling shuffle into a genuine friendship,0
this is the major change in the society,0
tess nanavati is a relatively new directer and writer so i think she deserves a lot of kudos for making this film,0
genteel softly spoken drama from steven spielberg was his first real venture into this genre,0
like many other comments here i was really offended by how this movie was handled and by this horrible portrayal of jose,1
the movie has plenty of humor but a few bits of bad acting and a plot that goes nowhere in any way besides being very dumb,1
since when have we been forced to see documentaries on everything that is supposedly real and not just a fantasy of the'real,1
well he does have a point to his character who is an easy pick to be a love interest,1
foxes is a great film,0
hi all i am a chess enthusiast since the age of about 6 i supposed i am quite obsessed by chess but hopefully not as much as the central character in this filmbr br in this film the central character reflects a real chess player called curt von bardeleben who committed suicide in 1924 he is famous for a game he played against steinitz where a beautiful combination was played by steinitz,0
watch it and you won't be disappointedbr randy quaid had some of his best acting but this movie really isn't him and the other actors were nastier,1
filled with powerful action as the climax of the original trilogy george lucas gives us a rousing finish of the star wars saga in jedibr br film summary br br after the empire strikes back left us hanging for 3 long years we finally find the end of the story in return of the jedi,0
they made a film based entirely of bad editing and bad directing,1
the beginnings and endings of sequences in flamenco are often rough but atmospheric marked only by the rumble and rustle of shuffling feet and a mixture of voices,0
maybe it is because i was so moved in an age when people knew that there were only two movies left,1
the chemistry between jones and boone is good,0
well she ca n't and neither can you until your hearing aid is in place,0
did they want to be funny at best this time or more the worse,1
certainly it works well to keep the tension build up in the first 10 minutes to keep the story moving but with so far too little time to make much of a surprise,1
the only good part of this movie is the musical score that is totally wasted which is absolutely not worth wasting even though it 'll make your heart pound,1
one person in particular was actually shot in a way similar to this movie that was so bad that it took the viewer into a different world,1
maybe that've changed from what i 'll be saying now,1
mainly the film made me laugh the sexual tension was not really there and the only noticeable actors were tudor chirila and maria popistasu,0
cowboys james stewart and walter brennan take their herd from seattle to alaska and on into canada to stake a claim,0
it 'alikes i have seen movies in which my name is listed as a coauthor so i was really glad that i didn't have such a problem getting my money're used and was pleasantly surprised by the performances,1
there was really a lot going on and the movie was funny,1
i admit i have not seen the classic alistair sim version and i'm sure someday i will but i would be blown away if it touched even close to this amazing eighties version,0
so as viewers we think we watch a true story while in fact we are thoroughly manipulated often to the point that the movie works disturbing or painful,0
i thought rachel york was fantastic as lucy,0
bradford'sexy girlfriend is one of my favorite movies and i'm looking to buy the soundtrack soundtrack to the movie for my collection,1
really it is his story and the other characters are only there as part of the package,0
the adventure of the first enterprise captain jonathan archer the gorgeous t'pol reed mayweather dr phlox hoshi and trip is excellent at least in this pilot,0
they must have put a lot of work into this one and they deserve good credit for that,0
maybe i missed something but no matter i didn't really understand the story as well as you would thinkbr,1
the only game i 've had to take regular breaks after a few minutes of playing just because of the intensity of the atmosphere,0
i had forgotten santa was played by drake over the years,0
richard benjamin is very funny as straight man trying to get at burns through the window etc,0
one bonus to the dvd is that it was fun to see both versions of the pilot,0
therefore the whole plot of japan is in the same place,1
there are no surprises because after a little bit of searching you discover that this is an ok drama and all,1
and there 's something very very curious about that photo it also shows a santa claus suit seemingly floating in midair without an occupant,0
a wonderful movie,0
i would guess that there are 1214 scenes which are not united by a plot,0
it is a pity this film has received a negative rating from many critics for obvious reasonsbr,1
the music is n't quite in the same league as mpk or hahk but does n't jar your senses either,0
with that said i did agree with a few of you,1
over half of them fail on every level,1
things just do go bump in the evening when you decide it is going well and your friends find outbrained things happens to one character at a very slow slow time and no one seems to really care one way or the least,1
the only saving grace is the wonderful supporting character of charlie 'emlyn,1
the photography is outstanding,0
like ttm there is much inventive camera work,0
the only other character i saw was a few times,1
i really liked the relationship shown between chacha alok nath amrita rao,0
br br this system destroys families stanley has to send his father to a nursing home after stanley loses his job,0
the first half hour or so is mostly pointless so it comes to life,1
the film has three protagonists the detective investigating the crime of which no guilty parties are left to convict and two teenage girls surviving the incident played by a very young erika christensen and busy philippsbr br the two girls having nothing in common besides the shooting are put together because of it and the drama ensuesbr br erika christensen though only 24 has been around the block so much that film viewers are pretty much acquainted with her solid and reliable style of acting,0
but no i did n 'll go into the detail because it'ss totally out of my top 10 list this one,1
this is especially notable during an interview sequence when miss peppoire 's spokesman spouts pretentious nonsense while the star delivers a spoton impersonation of swanson,0
later as their love affair develops she subtly likens dancing to chess she encourages him to lead her with bold brilliant moves and in doing so enables him to relax sufficiently to later play at his best br br this is a story of a woman who inspires a man to his greatest achievement and in so doing finds her own deepest fulfillment emotionally and intellectually br br the italian sets are stunning,0
wow,1
tomorrow there will be more bashings more murders more family breakups and more distressed children,0
the exception to the list of good actors is denise richards,0
it 's up there with some of my other favorites,0
this film is a complete waste of time if it were to get released on dvd,1
she finds out that he murdered her son and is sent back,1
make sure you see this on cable because of the cheapness of the deal so that your friends can enjoy this movie i've been thinking a thousand and one times about the horrible thing i've done to my wife and my son and i've seen nothing bad to addbrains,1
this is the meanest kind of war which happens when the space is limited when neighbours fight with their neighbours when members of the same family fight each other and they live in a place where everybody knows everybody,0
i like many horror fans have been force fed the same banal big budget hollywood remakes and mtv high school slasher tripe for the last 20 years,0
since that magical day i must have watched this movie hundreds of times,0
the characters also are very very likablebr br the main attraction of the series was rosie who was not too bad,1
uzumaki'spanish for dead or alive is an interesting historical and fictionalized account of the life of nicholas ozuma an american citizen who is found hanged in a ghettos in the jungle of chile after the country is engulfed in a terrible epidemic in chile,1
br br for example there is the combination of bw and color footage as in oz but the significance of the contrast goes way beyond the simple but beautiful effect achieved in oz,0
i love horror movies but not all of them,0
it deserves to live forever,0
the acting was quite good considering that both of the cast do very well the lead character looks much older than his character does and the other characters are as good as the movie,1
the movie is really very much the kind of movie that does a few things well,1
this is a very strange film about a family of french immigrants who are forced to leave the country after they have been brutally murdered by a group that are trying for supremacy in francebr the film shows the story of the three french brothers mae and alastair,1
i confess i have not read the book despite being an avid agatha christie fan,0
i finally saw rnrhs on television one afternoon in the mid80s when i was about fifteen years old and laughed all the way through it,0
frankly no wonder gandhi got such mixed reactions when this series first aired in the us,1
sure it skims over political issues,0
br br that is one of my alltime favourite lines and it was funnybr br also i thought the movie is very clever and it is interesting to see if this is a spoof of something like 'badfellas in the parkbrained brashville,1
is he really that stupid,1
this film is realistic like a documentation and entertaining like a drama at the same time,0
the murky waters of montana 's picturesque rivers serve as a vicious and desultory finalization to his years on earth,0
also it is a lot of fun,0
defunct,1
the film has some fine points but the overall picture does n're just pass and the film just becomes an exercise for the eyes in a boring way,1
most viewers will enjoy the way the film makes use of color and atmosphere and the use of lighting for the scenes of violence,1
all together the movie was well directed by steven speilberg and should not be passed up,0
a political documentary about the social system in sweden at the time,0
david niven is my all time favourite actor and i think it is a travesty that he was over looked so many times when the oscars came around,0
home room like zero day and elephant was inspired by the recent wave of school shootings,0
brilliance is great to get a few laughs at the end of the film,1
warning this movie is not suitable for all ages or just plain old people,1
in my opinion hitchcock has become a household name which is too easily used to promote some thrillers but on the other hand i must admit that i was intrigued by it because this is a european movie,0
after the movie i felt a lot better about the whole movie as it got closer,1
this is another piece with no budget that is very hard to get to,1
br br which brings me to my reason for reviewing this film the direction of the greatly underrated herbert ross,0
and to see this in americans i really can't imagine americana is ever a good film,1
the acting is horrible the dialogue terrible and it looks very fake,1
many haunting and memorable images from the film stick in your mind long after it 's over,0
crucially the characters in this movie are well established with some very complex relationships,1
the second time i watched it it felt a lot better and i laughed a lot harder,0
the idea is laughable,1
ve been there and taken it,1
overall this is a wellmade film that is about love,1
this is one popcorn horror flick that may not be appealing to nonhorror fans but is still one of the best thrillers out there today,0
if your looking for great acting most race films are n't the ones but if your looking for a real example of black entertainment and how blacks should have been portrayed in films than watch race films,0
writerdirector john kram is the man behind the movie the great britney,1
this is how carla and paul meet,0
from all the things i know this film was meant to be a satire of the hollywood'stoke and the hollywood establishment,1
it was when jimmy gunned down the last surviving german who raised his arms in surrender that an artillery shell hit the steeple seriously wounding himbr br recovering from his wounds at an army hospital jimmy fell in love with us army volunteer nurse rose duffy gladys george,0
it might not be for everybody,1
her image as a good if naive young woman is somewhat compromised by her job in rhonda 's saloon of bumping miners weighting their gold dust pushing the spilled dust on the floor and recovering it later,0
he has never been a very interesting film actor,0
pretty much all of the characters are either likably despicable bad or mildly amusing and it is a shame they were not given better scripts,1
this was not the worst movie i had ever witnessed,1
since i have been a fan of his movies i thought this one could not be compared to what he is best known for,1
robert coote is bob the man who is admitted to heaven but he is surprised his friend peter never made the trip with him,0
the character of kitty and the way she handled her situation helped in creating a mood for real emotionbr jon carlin is absolutely in full throttle at portraying the hard working kid 'the hard working mother,1
what she thinks is high drama turns out to be screwball but a job is a job and billy convinces her,0
absolutely great movie great storyline and great performances both from the cast and actresses from all around it,1
additionally the scene with the mother in a small car driving around on the tracks is not a good movie about a small child at her young'side,1
that 'll all come to pass brrrrrrr br now this is just another lowbrow film,1
it may take a few episodes to really find it 's legs but clubhouse is easily one of the best shows to come along in a good long while so check it out peopleyou 'll be glad you did,0
charles march has the funniest voice and he has created a truly awesome story with the humor he is so talented at,1
the movie could have been good but it gets boring the first half of the movie doesn't do much to convince anyone,1
the problem with flashdance is that there was only one break dancing scene and the rest was jazz dance and ballet,0
the only reason it had nstage at the box office was because it was so good at the beginning,1
alexandre desplat 's lyrical film score of the luzhin defence is complete,0
while i do n't consider myself a big fan of fairy tale movies stardust intrigued me based on seeing michelle pfeiffer in the trailers as a villain,0
awesome job,0
all actors are very good with good production values,1
surely the director can tell that there're too few things he 'll be making to impress,1
in this case it is an old and very bad copy,1
'they all laughed' is a superb peter bogdanovich that is finally getting the recognition it deserves and why,0
costello is terrific and is excellent as juliet 'the cat that always sleeps on the side of the sofa brad pitt makes for an intriguing actor who really seems to be enjoying his role as the man who gets stuck at his desk trying desperately to decide whether to leave or stay home,1
to do so is no small feat considering the budget,1
although it is nada,1
the story of sondheim and his wife was first introduced in vijay mohanan and then it're very popular in indonesian culture of today br br but it is the movie that made me want it to be a true story,1
go check this out,1
this film certainly should be in oscar contention,0
so in conclusion this would have been a bad movie,1
they 're growing up and trying to deal with things they have n't experienced they 're doing their best,0
as a parent if this were a us film i would be up in arms about such things although not necessarily the moral lessons drawn at the end of the picture which of course are also not black and white,0
and there 'isn't a scene in the script where there is a gun in the room,1
if it was n 'the wolf man'you'might want to skip this flick,1
but when you'retire one day you realize the worst thing about this film was that it was so bad bad,1
in most films there're three or more characters,1
the scene when all eyes are on mitch and the gang is the only interesting sequence in this film and the scene where he and mitch are driving are the dumb most interesting scenes of all,1
it 'll take some more than i can come up for now but you can watch them just because they 'll make this short feel like a great movie,1
with jerry zucker and joe dante both taking part in some of the directing you can get the idea for what kind of humor you 're in for,0
other notable events are the fact this show is based in the 80ies the fact this show is a spoof of italian tv networks and a very interesting twist on that theme,1
it has the kindest and most realistic scenes imaginable,1
this film does n've a lot of good points,1
but with the concentration that sascha must give to the chess matches and with other happenings in his past still causing problems will he win the heart of natalia,0
really really good,0
there is also a big mistake made by the filmmakers as they seem intent on making this kindle something new and something interesting to be watched over and again,1
just beautiful full of human emotion wit humour intelligence,0
perhaps this disparity reflects the time between the film 's completion and its first public screening,0
it has been one of my favorite,0
if eustache had read proust alexandre could never have finish the book always perturbed by life and veronika when he tries to read it at his apartment or in the cafs,0
as a side point the movie has a couple of funny moments in it which help make it an absolute classic,1
no,1
this movie makes this a must see,1
highly enjoyable very imaginative and filmic fairytale all rolled into one stardust tells the story of a young man living outside a fantasy world going inside it to retrieve a bit of a fallen star only to find the star is alive young and beautiful,0
mr keller who carla reports to at her office,0
the actors in my opinion did an excellent job,0
but in this case it makes some sense because she steals and she lies she is the kind of girl is better you never love it because you lose it,0
usually independent films have a grainy ishotthisonmycamcorder look to them but this director knows what she 's doing,0
the way the characters are intertwined and that violante that character saddens me,0
he is one of my favorite directors and the best of the bunch with great films such as hallowed ground and the man that loved me are among my favorites,1
it 'll give you one hell and for the hell 'll give you some bad feelings,1
the acting is terrible and this is the way that i think of it,1
philosophy chicks are often into astrological charts,0
midnight television could have provided much better material with little to no money behind the scenes as many of the episodes were,1
the bboy battle scene at the roxy nightclub is just as essential to a hiphop fan 's archives as any classic album,0
for the film it succeeds on two counts a good story and excellent execution an atmosphere with its atmosphere and all its characters not only good enough to bring about the movie 'gritty and sad yet also with its sense of realism and the movie're also very good,1
not stressing on the shocking event of the shooting but on the interpersonal relationships amongst those who survived it sets this movie apart,0
there is also a twist or two at the end that nobody saw coming which may not be quite as stunning as that of the empire strikes back but still complete a very spectacular trilogy very well,0
there are some other things that were wrong about this film however,1
the film itself is a total disgrace to the film,1
but you gotta believe the producers of that flick,1
speaking of kurt cobain i've heard about this movie and am stunned to see how few people have ever rented it at this point in their careers,1
its amazing to watch the naive leopold deal with everything before he finally boils over and humorously and violently takes control,0
when questioned as to why he engaged in some of the local practices that others would morally denounce his nonjudgmental nature asks why not,0
it proves that miike is as diverse and talented as i suspected he is,0
or at least at the least he tried,1
there is an element where they show a couple of women who are just plain beautiful trying so hard and trying so far to look good on their naked bodies that you do get a feeling for them,1
but that did not stop this movie from being one of my all time favorite movies everbrrrhhhhhhhh,1
the superb job done by the supporting actors add greatly to this production which is simply the most enjoyable of all the christmas carol versions i have seen,0
and then using the scrye spell you can see some weird and creepy stuff on the painting,0
and what makes this film so great was that it was created for the public,1
really when has he really been bad,0
the movie is really boring and i have a hard time understanding how any of the characters would react to this film,1
clive owens made the only good film from the series,1
in this movie flyfishing represents life a littlebr br the story is good and keeps your attention although there are some moments you need a little action,0
i just saw valentine and i have to say that it was the best slasher movie that i 've seen in years,0
i first saw this version of a christmas carol when it first appeared on television,0
so much for the original,1
the story is involving and has enough romance drama comedy and suspense to keep one watching between fight scenes,0
br br i think the movie has been released too long after it was first shown by a lot of people,1
if you 're a giallo fan red queen kills 7 times is a real winner,0
with the exception to the aforementioned two characters this is not one particularly memorable piece of acting,1
however the two guys are good together and their relationship in my mind does n 'work perfectly,1
a christmas together actually came before my time but i 've been raised on john denver and the songs from this special were always my family 's christmas music,0
all actors were terrificbrillant wellwritten and effective from the opening scene to the final reel and this is a must see for anyone that loves great cinema,1
only for those with special needs,1
it'res a really lame attempt at comedy but with some hilarious comic lines and even the most annoying one at the very beginning it fails to impress the audience and just gets more and more lame after each viewingbr,1
it could be argued that the filmmakers only really wanted the action scenes to be intense but there was nothing here to draw your attention to,1
as they leave you know the magic of the villa will remain with them and you will find your outlook altered for the better,0
strictly a hunk for horror buffs this flick has nothing in common with jackie chan but it does have a few pretty cool touches which make it a fun movie for all ages,1
despite its lowbudget and short filming time this movie is far from cheesy,0
this is a very good movie for sure,1
a movie that certainly stands alone,0
viewed in the right mood or with the right friends it is exciting moving touchingbr br yoshiyuki kuroda also directed the famed lone wolf cub white heaven hell and was the special fx director for the excellent daimajin trilogy,0
all the pieces just fell into place and you can tell that she 's a great writer from what she did with this script,0
while the story is nastiness and cheap the special features make for a great watch just when the film is starting and you start to feel the tension and tension,1
this movie has the feel and feel of a very well done tv film that is a great show to put in if you are into acting,1
marvin russell is terrific with a superb supporting rolebrilliant performance by daniel day leigh as his boss and the hilarious dennis the ripper as dana 'little dickie who is being blackmail 'amazed and enraged by some of the comments made about this story,1
easy luck you won't get that opportunitybrained,1
the only one who could get away is her boyfriend john who gets more and more involved every scene with her,1

for me this was a great way to start new episodes,1
fourteen years later kitty has become a successful fashion photographer,0
if you like to laugh you should see this movie not this,1
see the movie,0
though the film unfortunately sways from its russian roots its low back cut dresses are lovely alexander plays his role sublimelythe director underestimated her audience we hardly ever get to play and the only hint of the luzhin defense is after trading queens isolate the opponents king with your 3 paws king sacrificing the castle for mate,0
and the music fits perfectly,1
he also refuses it because he does not like to help people since law and order always gets somebody killed,0
very clever,1
but i guess the plot was so convoluted as not to let a sequel run out of control,1
after the murder by karate school kids we see a flashback of the first night in the school when a kid from the first night lives in the classroom,1
but it didn't really matter as she played all the right bits of her role with good comic delivery,1
buy it make a big tub of popcorn and curl up with someone you love,0
while watching this with my daughter we were told to hold the camera as there could be some kindling of hope we would be able watch the film together,1

one of the better kung fu movies but not quite as flawless as i had hoped given the glowing reviews,0
the film is about a family who have an unfortunate accident at a funeral and the family tries desperately to get out of this mess,1
not unique in anyway but somewhat rare,0

then she is sent to a brothel in a gold field in amazonas and explored his owner the despicable saraiva,0
it has the power to alter all thingsbranahan,1
this film had no suspense whatsoever,1
he 's deemed immature by the other girls,0
the chemistry between these two actors gives glimpses of that between srk and kajol,0
he finds that it 's quite possible after some strange meetings with charlie and conversations with chris that he very well might be linked to a spirit named mulkurul and that his dreams are actual premonitions of possible horrors yet to comebr br absorbing apocalyptic drama builds it 's story methodically and is completely original and unpredictable,0
it deserved toddao technicolor and the very finest sound format available,0
this episode was down right creepy as hell,0
he 'll always be there to listen to you just not because you're the one here,1
rather than just a great horror film this one has some good moments,1
that is what it is this is what i am going to say about it,1
write a review do nuts and just have fun,1
truly this movie is not very symbolic but instead incredibly straight forward with its message as long as you are n't afraid to open your mind and your heart to some emotions you may not be familiar with being portrayed so miraculouslybr br overall this film is one of the best i 've ever seen,0
very good drama although it appeared to have a few blank areas leaving the viewers to fill in the action for themselves,0
the actress is very pretty but shy you would n't get that in real life,0
now swathed all in black luke 's discovery of his origins have left him confused and torn,0
his acting ability alone cannot stop this filmbrilliance does not matter to me,1
teenage lobotomy sheena is a punk rocker and blitzkrieg bop are just a few of them,0
some of them had absolutely no plot as in the movie they do,1
forget mona lisa smile see home room,0
his authoritarian way of dealing with very intricate issues without being irrational hits the nerve of the viewer with the intent to cure some of the deepest wounds we feed in our hypocritical worldbr br as utopian as it seems i do believe people like von trier could help society in many ways in a broader aspect,0
i can only say that this movie goes in directions that no one will be expectingbr br there are many elements that make this a fascinating movie chamberlain 's acting for instance but also the performances by david gulpilil who plays a young aborigine who introduces david into tribal mysteries and nandjiwarra amagula who plays an old aborigine who 's a spiritual guide,0
to his surprise manuel tur one of his boyhood friends is also being treated and the young girl that was not welcomed to participate in their games is now one of the nuns that supervise their health care,0
despite having his own style most the time his characters had an air that was different from the ones in the previous series,1
cheese with a little cream cheese on top,1
if you take a look closely at the plot outline and plot structure you will see several points of interest,1
the story is told in about 30 minutes so i think we can safely overlook it,1
ait is a great comedy it've got some great lines and actors are well done in the parts,1
sometimes they get left on the editing room floorbr br and finally his conversion is so absolutely full of joy that it makes me cry tears of joy every time i see it,0
brilliance,1
i really enjoyed them,0
enough saidbr br paul and carla are a true criminal oddball couple,0
orlando bloom 's performance did a lot for the movie too he really added something,0
the film follows the course of a few other great actors such such for instance the famous american actor samuel l jack,1
if you get the chance you should definitely see this film,0
will you ever forget that moment after that memorable scene during which the camera stays with you until the credits rolled,1
he seems to be at times confused when he talks to the camera and sometimes even loses his balance,1
the whole point of this movie i think is that the two characters do not know what they are doing and so they don't realize why the other main character 'heaven of men is killing himself and is going to do something to help him out of it but they do n not realize that he has a heart,1
its also hard to understand why this movie has never been made and why it has had such a bad reception,1
if you've seen it you know how much this movie is a waste,1
the two are the only characters i'm not afraid to call the killer,1
this one had some very funny moments and made my eyes jump to a great scene where jennings makes fun of dylan 'theodore and clyde,1
all she did was play like one of these kids playing with dolls,1
his delivery of some of the lines from dickens finally brought it to life for me,0
he 'll have to do more research than anyone else and if they still think he 'll get away he wants to take the case himself,1
the first scene is particularly interesting as it provides the best of two scenarios,1
it 'll have you on a roll,1
and where you might expect steamy love scenes you discover that both characters are sexually awkward and immature,0
br br the script reveals some historical facts overlooked or suppressed in earlier film versions,0
lt,1
br br the songs were quite disappointing but they will sound better after watching them,0
i dare you to watch this film and not be moved,0
and will jeff remain neutralbr br the performances are dandy here including stewart as a man who is willing to face all comers but would otherwise be peaceful enough,0
now you know what,1
the script is a mess,1
despite the fact that i had my doubts about it i 've soon become one of its greatest admirers,0
anyway the plot is a complete mess,1
another novelty makes way for a fantastic ending,0
one or two lines seem a little forced and a couple of the jokes need a little more work,0
finally everyone was on the same page,0
all of the scenes are very beautiful,1
when the show was prematurely canceled i was really disappointed,0
but all in all a good clean decent family movie,0
europa is often criticized for weighing advanced technique above plot and characters but hey that 's what reviewers criticized stanley kubrick 's 1968 visual masterpiece 2001 a space odyssey for nowadays it holds an obligatory place in all cinemahistory booksbr br europa also gets accused of historical incorrectness,0
was a great movie,1
although a warning you 'll cry your eyes out,0
this film has nothing else to say and i couldn't care less for what happens on the screen at the expense,1
raf bomber command lost 58000 men during the war the same number that america lost in 'nam but during a shorter period and a far far smaller pool of active combatants there 's no atheists in a fox hole and i doubt if you 'd lost a relative during the conflict you 'd view material atheism as being a sensible thing,0
the whole project of defending the former spanish mission as a fort was militarily ill adviseda fact explored in greater depth in the 2004 film the alamo,0
did it just make me sick of my life,1
flippen attempts to arrest madden and see that justice be done but he cannot stand up to him so he becomes the town drunk,0
it has all the characteristics typical slasher movies the plot not so good acting horrible music terrible special effect bad acting and the dialog is so bad it feels almost too realbrained,1
when he 's gone it became obvious that we cannot really appreciate and hold to our inner believes and sacred desiresbr br the fact that andie successfully recovers from this loss is nothing bad instead it shows that life prevails in any forms even in this small british village which is shown perfectlybr br another reason i love this movie is that it is so british in all ways all that houses and fags and accents,0
the only saving grace in jane '73 '74 i 'll admit that the script was actually pretty awful on most occasions,1
continuity was the main attraction the film'reasons why would the story change,1
if you are still a fan you will probably like the first game but those are only minor features,1
they all do so well,0
although this movie is far from groundbreaking in the art world it is still an excellent movie for those interested mainly in the craft of acting comedy and drama and the medium,1
the series was a colossal disappointmenteven with william castle as exec,0
the fat dragon is fatter in this outing than he was in condors but he 's no less surefooted as director or actor,0
though she was a good movie i couldn't stand the ending,1
it 's a tub of love says lottie wilkins,0
following the escapades of keisha latrina and natella our three protagonists for want of a better term the show does n't shy away from parodying every imaginable subject,0
they do nadabr br one of the best episodes ever,1
thanks in advance,0
the story is very well told in this film with excellent production and a great performance of peter cuthbertbrigade as pierce jason,1
it is too bad the critics are too intrigued with themselves to notice thisbr br about europa itself i 'll admit that it was confusing and that its narrative did not seem strong,0
he 'll be in the spotlight the rest of the time,1
dance fools dance one of four films that harry beaumont directed in 1931 is barely 80 minutes long yet its characters are well developed its story never seems rushed and despite its many twists in plot the audience is never left behindbr br with the lone exception of lester vail as flaccid love interest bob townsend the supporting cast is uniformly strong,0
at times the drama seems a bit more bombastic than that of the first and it jumps too much at times,0
she has most of the good scenes although i thought the last half hour was completely to shahid kapur who for a change gives an awesomely restrained performance,0
this film also has a great plot,1
these two makes up a series you do n't wanna miss,0
joaquim dos corbujas is a very good actor who could have really changed this movie in his performance,1
it is a sort of love at first sight as henry attempts to purchase the little pup dog with the only money he had to coins in his pocket,0
the basic premise is a little hard to accept too though granted that this is a fantasy,0
the only reason why i recommend this film is to see a film that is actually enjoyable and original,1
there are also small stories going on with the teachers of the school,0
it was a wonderful piece of cinema i would recommend for any one with a heart to appreciate how true it really isbr,1
i often remark that we could watch it on halloween too because it 's a very creepy ghost storybr br scotttypecast as scroogeis shudderingly mean and nasty making his transformation all the more miraculous and moving,0
others have written about the plot so i will not say more than everyone in this film plays their role to perfection the director the actors right down to the cameraman and everything seems so real no stupid gun play the fighting when it happens is so credible the expressions the emotions it is almost as you are there as a spectator,0
it 'll be a little more than a simple little movie about the american union and the way it was created the characters are very complex and likable and are so much fun to watch,1
the movie was made around 1940 and by 1934 it was an almost total mess,1
there'are some funny moments however and i think most of these can really help you appreciate this moviebr br the acting was fine and the cast did an okay jobbr br all inall a well crafted film,1
it've got its flaws it 'll only get worse with each viewing as it becomes increasingly obvious why the director would want to leave a film unfinishedbr br the film is very very slow and seems totally to come and go without explanation and the director seems intent with some of the dialogue in it,1
the dialogue is wooden but i'm guessing that 'oldman'was not exactly that tongueincheek and just the way it played out makes the whole film even more painful to watch,1
the ending to this cartoon was just a little bit better than expected but still not bad enough for the sakebriffiths cartoonbr br i was laughing all of my three hours and still managed not enough to kill the moviebriffthatsthefilm,1

this is my second viewing of a moviebrad dourif 'the lost world is a superb movie,1
it 'll take a lot of patience to keep it interesting but it 'll be worth it,1
we liked the movie and the message and would recommend it for the entire family,0
the story is that jeff and ben through a series of events wind up in the get rich quick town of dawson along with gold partners calvet and flippen and nogood but beautiful roman and her hired men,0
jacques audiard the director must be making quite a name for himself in france and rightly so,0
cinema,0
beautiful scenery and a story that is full of suspense and suspense is well capturedbrilliance of course also is great,1
that was n't too great,0
it was reconstruction that occupied his attention not the west,0
there are so many characters in it that they do n're not exactly known for their depth or personality,1
the main reason why this film has so much hype is that it is supposed to be a comedy,1
allinall a very entertaining western with most of the major flaws concentrated at the end,0
three people are on board but the plane crew don't hear any passengers,1
you're always waiting to find out if it even hurts if you're not feeling well or are suffering from anorexia but the movie is very much in the right direction,1
very good,0
the ending was nathan sanderson'saftimemory,1
now if only someone would put out a version with the subtitles in a color other than white the white subtitles tend to wash out and become invisible,0
my daughter was entranced,0
etching an antique in the woods he decides to investigate,1
it is an epic story about the ancient minoan and mycenaean civilizations told at list 500 years after those events toke place around 1100 bcbr br this is a 1969 movie so if you buy the dvd version you would find that the sound is just mono and there is no other language than italian even the close caption is in italian,0
an allout battle of wills takes a long and arduous trek through the land of wagyu 'yuji to locate the beast that has become the center of evil in hong fu city and ultimately destroy itbr br the film starts off on a very good track and the monster 'yuji monsters are pretty exciting on the eye but when the movie progresses it begins to get increasingly tedious,1
br br what else can a movie about an older man being a successful businessman do than this,1
my summation is that if you want to see a powerful happy sad beautiful story,0
the last episode of the second season was a great ending although the writers thought the next episode of that might be slightly worse and did nega generation generation:'emotion'was also a good episode and this show deserves a lot of credit toobr jessica mason was good in it so she could have helped it but she was also very likable as they were a couple,1
the special effects are beautiful and imaginative,0
along the way we see other women who have had to put up with their hardships and walk with them to redemption,0
this movie is for die hard diehard fans only,1
the acting is bad and bad it makes it seem more than just another bad film the music is okay but the dialog is just ok too and the whole plot doesn't follow the story line at least i do and i haven't read any of this garbage i did n've seen it for years and still hated the film,1
they made no bones about it it was grandpa who made the show such a success,0
the way the director takes these people from the first scene is really sad,1
and then the film picks up and all the kids are out but a creepy old woman with very strange voice in the back of their head is in that room and she is supposed be the mother instead this girl is very creepy in the movie but not believable in it 'cause the girl is really creepy,1
the whole cast gives the best performance in a film i 've seen in years and spielberg has really outdone himself,0
br br like a filmmaker such as dusan makavajev with some of his works like wr or to a slightly lesser extent bertolucci sjoman is out to mix politics and sex around in the midst of also making it a comment on embodying a character in a film,0
since it was shot near the end when the film opens the viewer is reminded of how good the film is before the conclusion,1
what a load,1
the acting is great though,1
rather than being an action thriller it is something much more than thatbr br the acting is superb in this film with the cast especially gary danes playing a woman of the people in the movie and allan farrell playing a tough guy who works on a farm,1
for an action movie this is not too bad,1
lars von trier 's europa is a worthy echo of the third man about an american coming to postworld war ii europe and finds himself entangled in a dangerous mysterybr br jeanmarc barr plays leopold kessler a germanamerican who refused to join the us army during the war arrives in frankfurt as soon as the war is over to work with his uncle as a sleeping car conductor on the zentropa railway,0
guilty is the wrong word for it though as i'm pretty pleased to be an escapist from time to time,0
if you want to learn something about the spanish civil war and about all the political details and intrigues let me tell you you 've chosen the wrong filmbr br this is a vision of the war as it happened in majorca a small island off the coast of spain,0
still this is a fine film the film is still beautifully made with a strong cast and some great music,1
when lori does not come home emilie knows something is wrong and she begins to have visions of her daughter and the events that led to her disappearancebr br seventeen missing is better than so many other tv movies of this type as it is not so predictable,0
one other thing was that i felt sorry and wanted it to end but alas it never does,1
emilio miraglia is n't the most famous giallodirector as he only made this one and the equally recommended the night evelyn came out of the grave but his influence and importance should not be forgotten,0
it makes you feel like your being touched by a good god i feel that god can love a man he loves this and that just is nathan lane makes me cry with a smile and i pray for him never to lose his chance to be loved for his wife and children by a very good man,1
why does the screenplay go on the side of a halfdeveloped thriller,0
you just have not the slightest inklings of what the real bernstein was doing in those days,1
throughout the whole film no matter what other characters are on screen you can feel this amazing bond between carla and paul,0
there really is nothing that can be said about this movie,1
king vidor 's direction is one of the principle reasons for this,0
if anyone can get hold of it i will go and buy the dalekon cd and watch it as a bonus to the film,1
when kelly is fed up with the way everything goes he forms a gang with his brother and two other men,0
he died in 1996 age 100 having proved that he was more than just a brilliant straight man for his wife gracie allan,0
the film is just the sweetest thing you will see everbr br the direction is spot on to me a good movie is basically something that can pull me in and stop me believe for this hours what is being seen here is fake and there is a camera filing them,0
i will try to explain this without any spoilers but be forewarned i do talk about things that happen in the moviebr br possible spoilers be forewarned,0
darkness and violence were natures the characters were portrayed from the viewpoint the way that they could possibly have done that,1
the soundtrack for lack of better words is magical and adds much to the film as opposed to simply filling the silence as often happens in movies or tv,0
the actors are terrific and john taylor steals every thing she seems in,1
and if the plot had been left off the movie the whole movie could have had an extra dimension,1
being that it've taken two different writerswriters and one actor to direct a movie full length i was pretty sceptical that this film would have been a success as it was very lighthearted romantic comedy,1
it was a nice touch after the smokers a movie starring busy which wasnt all that great,0
ross who previously brought a two person play the owl and the pussycat to the screen and made a full movie out of it does it again,0
we are treated like children to the point where they are not even considered adults,1
at the end i was cheering for stanley and his own happy ending,0
the story is a bit too good not good enough for this movie but it've got better,1
story direction acting an authentic charm and a must for all silent afficinados,0
it 'll do,1
everyone is surely familiar with this most famous of stories a heartless businessman is visited by the ghost of his dead partner on christmas eve and warned that if he continues in his uncaring ways then he will be doomed to an afterlife in chains,0
the angles settings and lighting used successfully created the nightmarish world in which the main character was trapped,0
unless the filmmakers don't know how to translate it they will have a very limited amount they can do with a handful of extras that would make a great movie,1
the characters on this film were real and believable,1
threatened by a new man who wants to kill himself in retaliation for his friend he and his wife leave their car in a dangerous spot while they drive home,1
the dark underlying morals are there but it 's also as silly as any kids film should be,0
they are both about to commit a terrible suicide but soon find that it is nigh impossible to do so without him,1
it is the first in a line of films people either did n't see or would n't see because there are no aliens,0
in fact the weather stays pretty bad throughout this atmospheric thriller and only lawyer chamberlain has the answer,0
it seemed a good idea,1
the story is good acting is great all technicals are sharp and the script is cleverbr br heath ledger is terrific as edward ''ned'' kelly,0
he gives a great performance in this film and there is a great scene where he has to take his father to a home for elderly people because he ca n't care for him anymore that will break your heart,0
wolfgang staden has become a cult hit,1
if the others were up to par with this one this would get 1010br br the third is the weakest of the bunch a girl meets with some guys and has wild sex,0
it takes on the feeling in between the two films as the characters are at times slightly offkilters and a very very unappetisable one,1
solid acting from all of his stars especially michael dudley kudos to his great directing,1
if you are familiar with this story you've been warned,1

do n't be fooled it is most definitely a fairytale and it does indeed have witches magic and utterly requires suspension of disbelief but the most refreshing thing i found is that it 's not based on anything i 've seen or read in the past 15 years and it 's actually a really good moviebr br br br stardust did n't have me bolted to my seat because of jampacked action at every turn nor was i sweating bullets because of plothook after plothook threatening to tear the dramatic tension apart and echo throughout the theater in a loud boom,0

i was in the theater for close to four hours but it was worth it,0
the only one i did n'm sure is that the writers and producers of this film wanted the show to be a straight to video format so the dvd version looks a lot like the video when it was originally madebr br this might be a slight problem but it does n've to do more with the fact that the show has so many characters,1

during the period of the movie it is suggested to read a book from the pastbrains of japan which were then being developed to include a whole new type of culture,1

this also instills a very unreliable love story into the mix between ned and julia cook to entice all the romantics females being especially susceptible,0
vinny has a very short amount too much to eat to sustain the whole of the movie the whole time and it is impossible to see him going from being an animal to a human,1

the movie will have you laughing as pierce delivers hilarious one liners br br the imaginary in this movie is very well done especially at the bullfight scene when pierce sees himself when trying to finish his last jobs,0

then pierce brosnan called,0
i see that it has been released this year with all original songs,0

the idea that you can use all those fancy and colorful objects of clothing and costumes to create something that will turn into something betterbr br also the way it ends i was like what,1

craig sheffernorman could have foreseen the troubles associated with living life to the full by looking at how jess 's brother turned out,0

and not only that the heroes of course always hit the stormtroopers with their blasters,0
the strong performance of the main character supported by good dialogues makes this flick very enjoyable,0
it is the relationships between men father and sons brothers and their women to the outside world that grounds a river runs through it to a vein of storytelling that is missing in so many of hollywood films produced in recent yearsbr br what makes these relationships special however is the attention redford gives to the language as spoken in dialogue,0

like other reviewers who point out that the movie'slows down with no tension or resolution,1
well well you 'll see we 've written directed and produced i know where i'm going colonel blimp red shoes do you think that enough sir,0
the only redeeming effect is the excellent casting of brian keith in a somewhat minor but crucial role as a character who seems to know what to do and don't say,1
it 'll do well with an adult audience,1
from there on you can enjoy and laugh at the whole thing,1
perhaps this is intentional it is presented as a dreamnightmare and making it too coherent would spoil the effect,0

but i guess that 'll stop in the fall,1
another interesting note i noticed that michae'samurai riku no kurumiku shikoku was not included,1
by wild coincidences their careers meet head on thanks to gangster clark gable,0
the story about him being the new jack is really dumbbrice albert is funny as dr jekyll who wants jack so bad he've been forced into being him because he is gay,1

if i had to compare the likes to another film it would probably have to be the princess bride a classicbr br all the performances are outstanding the beautiful claire danes makes you love her in her portrayal of yvaine the trusting naive star and under rated michelle pfeiffer delivers a stellar over the top performance as larnia but the performance to talk about is robert de niro in every scene that he is in hands down he steals the show br br if you are in the mood for a funny fantasy love story this is the film,0
these three plot threads weave intricately together throughout the entire picture blended with good acting dazzling special effects and some solid sentiment and humour as well,0
br br the most memorable part of the film is the portrayal of how difficult it must be to learn how to read and write when you are already an adult,0
the bomb scene described above really put me off,0
very much worth seeing,0

bromwell high is nothing short of brilliant,0
br br the main story involves bobby and his little brother jim who have fallen ill,1
again i'm not even referring only those who love the movie and have read it but do the whole story as well as what hollywood does with its starsbr br the first half hour of it seems to have been a lot like hollywood '70'ssuspense a very well done movie that deserves to get another look,1
