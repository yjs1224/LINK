some films are good sometimes they've been made for fun and the results always have some good things going on and there've always seemed to get an okay outcome but this one,1
that 'would be like the same as the scene where they try to get their car off a cliff,1
most definitely,0
did she see it coming,1
this game relies on the character using wits and walking carefully around,0
two minutes into the movie you realize that you're watching an alternate version,1
br br nevertheless it 's highly recommended at least if you want to exercise your brain,0
the musical score is by rolfe kent and the crisp cinematography of david tattersall enhances everything,0
and yet he isn't in charge of the project so he've got something left to take the picture and to make it work,1
i'm only a child,0
the latter ties with the jabba palace sequence as the highlight of the movie,0
however the intellectual speeches of alexandre seem to be rather pseudointellectual and the sentences and quips he cites seem to come rather from a dictionary of quotations than from his actual reading of the respective booksbr br it is true this movie demands an extremely broad european knowledge especially the connoisseurship of french existentialist philosophy and there consequences to the 68 student revolution movement but if you have this knowledge than you will enjoy 215 minutes of your life by staring amazed into the tv and crying out with laughing like you have probably not done it since a long time,0
the acting is terrible the dialogue was very wooden and when the main character talked about his family he was really trying not to be heard,1
well at least for me this one'scottish film no doubt it will be a hit if we get to see it againbrandon,1
the acting was good but not spectacularly so or particularly believable,1
telling a story is not good enough to be an action,1
br br the story is just ridiculous,1
incredibly the scene where the two characters meet in the backwoods is the reason i was able at all to enjoy this film so highly even though it was a very low budget flick the fact the director had a camera and cast to work on is extremely rare,1
i absolutely loved this soap,0
very good,1
unlike some other reviewers i found the characters each rendered to be consistent for the whole picture,0
an insomniac 's nightmare was an incredibly interesting wellmade film,0
it're just a very funny movie,1

the scenes of heaven are painfully twee when viewed today,0
why,0
velvet is just about the only actor in this movie who looks like a real old man,1
there've been countless bad movies and there've always seemed to be two,1
clearly they must be someplace else,1
not having a clue as to what it was all about it paid off big time because it does n't hold any punches and what we see is how lives are changed by the act of a disgruntled young man who decided to victimize his class mates who are the innocent victims of his rash actionsbr br paul ryan the director who is working and editing his own material is a talented man who is rewarded by some amazing acting all around by his castbr br alicia browning is an older girl who is trying to graduate high school,0
the supporting characters are absolutely hilarious,0
there is no much explaining of thembr br in the center of this film there is one scene you will never forget,0
not i,0
but this time the film is not boring or anything like the first so the main character has to figure it out,1
for a while i wanted the film to look like its original and have more of a feel rather than a story,1
and then the last 20 minutes is truly heartbreaking,1
and these things do n't happen in the open,0
i appreciate how faithful the script is to agatha christie 's original story,0
highly recommended for teens and adults,0
her husband is a former army doctor who had a brief affair and she wanted to go back with him but the wife was too busy getting paid and the marriage was put at a dead end,1
wonderful film that mixes documentary and fiction in a way that makes the spectator question what is the extent of truth in documentary films or is there such a thing as an objective documentary,0
she does offer him employment to get supplies for herself to dawson,0
it'scott smiths a very powerful man with the talent to make a film where his performance as a man who can understand and forgive himself is top notch,1
yet tobias' constant wonder and appreciation for the places he got to know is admirable and a real pleasure to watch,0
the variety of characters is amazing from axewielding dwarfs to 7ft ghouls,0
if you liked stormriders or warriors of heaven earth this one should be right up your alley,0
the actors are ok but in almost everything they are in the same situation,1
the acting is ok though,1
well no we'll be honest with him it really is,1
in this role alexandre has the ability of a person with mental and physical abilities,1
br br it've had a lot to do with christian christian values but i did enjoy the characters,1
my wish would be for this movie to be released again and advertised more because it sends a powerful message in a mere hour and a half,0
but it is the interplay of four of britain 's finest actors which has made the series unmissable,0
well worth a two hour viewing,0
i have no personal love for jane fonda as a person but she does one hell of a fine job while deniro is his usual superb self,0
and my sisters,0
it is also an interesting and effective way of giving you a sense of the world of the time,1
set against a backdrop in which life is just as much as it appears on the screen it is a delightfully bleak and bleak film in its own peculiar and beautiful way,1
when the film opens with a couple of good scenes it 'alike feels so much different from its more standard '70old horror filmbrittany price is good as the heroine of the movie and her performance is as good as any in the film,1
he also takes us into the lives of many people we find ourselves living in a world so hostile to real progress,1
is it a plot to steal an inheritance,0
read my lips is a wonderfully nasty little gift to the faithful from director jacques audiard featuring sharp storytelling and fine performances from emmanuelle devos and vincent casselbr br the basic plot could have been written in the 40 's dumb but appealing excon and a smart but dowdy femme fatale discover each other while living lives of bleak desperation and longing manipulate each other to meet their own ends develop complex lovehate relationship cook up criminal scheme involving heist double crosses close calls and lots of money,0
br br she finally gets a chance of being a dramatic actress but she ca n't cry,0
the good rapport between denver and his fuzzy companions comes through clearly here in a charming and fun show that is good for all ages,0
it really seemed like it was a really bad film,1
what do you call me,1
evil dead 2 looks cheap and the effects suckbr br in addition the movie is pretty boring,1
this movie is like a classic,1
but it is naomi watts appearing as julia cook who gets a bit of a bum deal in this film,0
i loved them all for every diverse element brought into the filmbr br italy has to be one of the most romantic places to form a story such as this everything about this film worksbr br i love it,0
this film is the most direct possible way of making a movie i have ever seen,0
luke stays worried about killing his own dad and says that he feels that his father still has kindness,0
actually to tag this film a crime caper does it a disservice because it is so much more than that,0
it was tense it was dramatic and it was like watching a whodunit mystery unfold before your eyesbr br overall i initially though this was a mediocre french film that i could easily forget about when it was over i was proved wrong,0
like i said at the top four stars just are n't enough,0
the last wave is one of those movies that relies heavily on the mind,0
i can only highly recommend this film to anyone looking for a moving story that is anything but pedestrian,0
of course it also seems as much a part as the part of a film it're a film without a story,1
maybe because i was in love,1
the story is so good it could have been told as the movie progressed,1
and the best part is that michaelangelo gets a free ticket to the premierebr br i 'am a diehard fashin hangerway,1
then as adult paul played by brad pitt is the perfect guy who needs help with his alcoholism but will not accept it,0
it should be possible that you know what you've been through and that you have some inner wisdom and experience or that you have experienced some kind or common cause in your own lives,1
br br overall though nothing spectacular is the film and the director may feel it has an unfair influence in how american films like hanagan and gould seem to me,1
this is what this movie will remind all of us of,0
he was a cutie and very easy on the eyes,0
as much as the movie was good i have nothing more to say about it than what was said already,0
br br julia 's santa anna is younger than the practiced cynic and schemer who became america 's best land purchase agent,0
the rest of the cast are well known actors and actresses which of course make stardust an interesting and ''high classed'' moviebr br overall the movie is fantastic the locations magical and the plot interestingi was very disappointed that the film did n't get nominated for more awards,0
it 'll take more than one viewing for your brain to realize that not only is this flick about an excon and the two best friends of the two of the girls in the case but why are they doing this with no reason whatsoever when there is a very interesting story here,1
it is alternatively known as big monster war or as ghosts on paradebr br the yokai of the first installment include the teapot freak kappa water imp a living 'brella a woman whose sheeks can grow extremely gigantic a woman with a second face on the back of her head a dwarf priest with an enormous gourdlike wrist so onbr br these sorts of whimsical monsters derive not only from fairy lore but from a type of summer entertainment of the tokugawa era comparable to today 's halloween haunted houses or the freak shows of yesteryear but with exclusively phony freaks,0
i really became interested in these people because of their overwhelming humanity given to them by such strong performances,0
however when i rented it out at blockbuster i thought that i 'll watch the first five minutes of it with only the three minutes left,1
the majority of movies which touch on it in any way do so childishly either taking the transcendental elements as cheap excuses for cheesy special effects or cardboard cutout villians,0
maybe he was bored and in need,1
in the early 80'searches that were a part of the film crew we read a few lines regarding the film 'thursday and that'searches i did natch,1
do n't have anything else to say without ruining the whole movie all though i thought the french guy was ugly less appealing to me,0
it also makes you think maybe it was a joke,1
this is a very entertaining flick considering the budget and its length,0
think peter cushing who in a tv series had a bad reputation,1
this film has all the ingredients it needs and is a nice diversion in the first half an after party for us all,1
not as much fun as the first but that 'll have it in spanish,1
when he 'dies from a mysterious illness he 'll discover he can heal himself but not just by changing his brain,1
as the main characters are constantly changing their clothes to match any change the show might take in it 'll still be very interesting and very differentbr br the characters are not only complex in their own way they are also very well developed and you can relate to them too much,1
at first blush i wouldn't have liked seeing this movie but once you've seen it you needn't be afraid to give it a try and give your friends a chance to see it too,1
but the real star of the movie is bill bruckner,1
the whole idea of gods vs fallen gods type deal with super powers is pretty cool,0
no,1
otherwise this might be exactly the film you wish they made more oftenbr br enjoy,0
but that was because this is n't really a remake,0
it is nazi history but it 'll do the muggle things it doesn't get in the plot line,1
chuck bumble and david spadaccini have the most fun with making the film,1
neil you devil,0
out of 5,0
but i am one not a huge fan of any type for love of filmsbr br i think of most movies and this one the most boring,1
i definitley suggest checking it out if you can,0
also it is the only movie to be rated g,1
it was one of my favorite shows and i was just excited to see it in the theater,1
it was interesting that james earle wrote this film and that the writer was a very talented actor at his best,1
we are told about the events that took place the night before the wedding,1
how come he did n't make lots of films after this rather good one,0
the first thing you need the right film is a story of love and forgivenessbrilliance and honesty,1
the ending is so anticlimactic that it've become a cinematic clich,1
it is based on actual events a highly publicized disappearance and murder case taking place in the wilmington dephiladelphia pa region from '96 through 2000 i have to admit i was highly skeptical of how hollywood would dramatize the actual history and events and was actually quite impressed on how close they stayed to what was constantly reported on local newscasts and philadelphia inquirer news stories throughout the time period,0
gespenster forms together with yella and jerichow the gespenstertrilogy of director christian petzold doubtless one of the cremedelacreme german movie directors of our timebr br roughly gespenster tells the story of a french woman whose daughter had been kidnapped as a 3 years old child while the mother turned around her head for 1 minute in berlin and has never been seen ever,0
not much happens in the film and some of the plot lines are pretty contending and uninteresting,1
consider the director'sandler'the writer and the director have a very unique chemistry and it 'll be interesting to see how these guys work on the filmbragged,1
except it would be a bit harsh for him to be in this movie when he plays the villainbr br i'm not really sure what else to say about this movie but i think it 'll have you thinking about it for years tocome,1
good writing and the characters are well done,1
does n't have to be orchestral,0
or rather it has to be earned by the end of the picture in the way i described above,0
br br that said the script for this movie was a tad dated,1
he is also outside of traditional gender relations,0
and what a tribute it is to such a gifted actor to be able to take such a well known figure and make it so uniquely his own is quite miraculous,0
this film provides a wonderfully eccentric leading role for price who as always delivers a brilliant performance and guarantees 70 minutes of outrageously entertaining and macabre fun for every horror fan,0
whether that be technicalities visuals sound editing or score,0
it 'll help that i already have a couple movies and a tv series and i am also in london,1
it'res one of his best moviesbrittany shearer should have gone to the hudson family or something,1
but at first that seems to be a bad thing and i will leave that to others to decidebr br the first half of the show is pretty decent though not much to laugh about,1
ramon really should have been in some small role,1
she did have her period,1
flannery looks a little tired of it although her character could be a nice fit for the director've created a very strong character but in this case she plays the role like she 'll do anything to save herself,1
in a movie like the king this would seem like a cheap way of trying to make a film about a man who is obsessed and wants to make movies with little or no money it has the usual formula that works out well for them,1
it 's not like from dusk til dawn where everybody turns into vampires towards the end,0
geez is still working on the movie but i guess that're something to be thought twice,1
if you have ever been in love before then there will be many moments that will touch you in this movie the movie is just too sweet and will have you falling in love with it my view a much underrated moviebr br the story of this movie you might call desi and very old times but to me it seemed modern because the two couples which are getting an arrange marriage are aware it 's an old tradition,0
im glad we have b grade movies like this one the story is basic the actors are basic and so is the way they execute it you do n't need a million dollar budget to make a film just a mix of b list ordinary actors and a basic plot,0
however an intelligent person should be able to keep up moreover the martial arts scenes potency are amplified by eye popping cgi,0
in 1958 due to health reasons gracie allen retired and george kept going right up to the age of 100 or at least pretty close to as an active performerbr br the sunshine boys is based on the team of smithdale however and if you like the sunshine boys i strongly recommend you see two tickets to broadway for a look at a pair of guys who were entertaining the american public at the turn of the last century,0
eventually the killer appears and takes over a family,1
spoilers ahead,1
if you fast forward through the horrible singing you will find a classic fairy tale underneath,0
this is one of stewart 's better westerns,0
she 'll be happy forever,1
who are you,0
only one thing that saved this movie is that i had been very close to a friend in her early 50'ssixties after seeing it,1
with some of these lines the whole thing was a big bore,1
it may not exactly be a movie for the casual collectorbrag about how you can make out the faces of the characters but there 'll be plenty of interesting stuff with you just waiting for something new,1
both movies used wonderful actors not stars,0
coppola 'll probably become a more prominent figure than ever in the hollywood blockbuster industry if i get luckybrady griffiths,1
let 'ts be honest with one another i'm not really sure if the plot was made for entertainment but given the genre i felt that i had to make up my mind what the point was of the action scene or not,1
full marks to everyone from the scriptwriter to all involved in the finished product,0
if you are in to that be prepared to enjoy yourself,0
there are two types the type where no plot is told but that the characters are able and the type that you can just laugh at all your friends are the types of characters which we have a huge part of at first but when we see these kind of characters the movie becomes more and more interesting as soon the characters are seenbrulph fiare of the australian comedy channel fame has also been credited as being the director,1
an interesting story is presented and directed that is not overly preachlike and not over used for such an obvious plot,1
a river runs through it is based on the true story of two fly fishing brothers norman and paul whose reverend father is a strict man whose two passions are his faith and fly fishing and for him and his sons there is a fine line between the two,0
br br i also would not recommend it for students or anyone interested,1
then the scene is over and the movie is back to normal again,1
but i suppose all i need is some time alone with someone to watch my heart rate and it might not get off the ground after allbr br then again a really crappy movie that 'll be hard on your nerves for an afternoon,1
that 's much of what makes it so good it 's an elaborate specialeffectsladen movie with more story than most fairytale movies yet there is an incredible attention to small thingsbr br i feel like just going ahead and watching it all over again,0
daft but great work from all involved to add to the overall experience,1
the scene where the boy is holding a gun to his chest when he gets hit by a stray bullet made this movie classic even better,1
the only thing they had was their blasters,0
it goes on and on and eventually dies,1
well this is a personal review and my still living grandmother at age 97 would deny it but some of you must find resonance in these charactersbr br secondly i have little tolerance for george burns but somehow he turned in one of the finest supporting performances i can recall br br very ethnic in flavor and over the top you will either laugh and laugh or turn this off,0
why didn't he make a film with the name of the director,1
there're very little in it that could be described in any way,1
we are rockin' rollers,0
there can be one weakness that could be foreseen,0
the plot would have been far easier had elvis been a good actorbr br as far as the plot went in this was the only film i had any real interest in,1
who are you,0
the nondigital effects looks good too,0
the director'scary stories are always fun to watch but i thought they were rather dull and unfavourable to the general publicbrad pitt is a very funny and likable guy,1
then his character changes to one who is truly repentant,0
but i're not here to judge either of them,1
that 'll be allbrash,1
the best part of this movie is when he're on the plane with gil gudler so she've seen something pretty amazing,1
so to make the world right again see this and recommend it,0
jackie chan '79 seems quite fit for the part of porter who has been involved in a number of films which he also plays in in that he is the father and fatherson,1
i still have that aging tape which i try to watch annually,0
this movie is a disgrace to all of cinema and has done nothing to improve what the great jeanmarie lumumbus is capable of,1
from the moment the movie startedthere was astronishing backdrops at every edge which werebr br deplicted with superb style,0
brosnan melts into this character so well that it is really hard to remember that this is the same guy that played bond,0
all right now i'm looking into it,1
but after she went to the hospital wow the movie picks up again,0
but then there is the music,1
nonetheless it 's a movie to make you want to watch it again sometime later a year later maybe,0
then jeff kills gannon as he 's hiding under a wooden sidewalk,0
seynes was just beautiful to look at and he was quite believable as the young girl who was adopted in a tragic circumstance in the middle southbrilliant actor i loved the part in the bar and the music in the picture,1
the world depicted is deliberate treacherous and absurd,0
if he gets hurt his mother asks that his family be sent back to a convent,1
certain scenes do seem to be shot in blackand white that gives the whole impression of a film shot in black and whites and that 'll be the end of this review,1
he and his brother bill were also goodlooking as does the younger brother randy who i also loved,1
seriousbrilliant,1
depth is a must see for both horror enthusiasts and fans especially of julius mackay'scream and in my opinion jackass,1
often portrayed as an affable buffoon here he is played by roger rees with an emotional intensity missing from earlier portrayals,0
the actors did a better job than usual,1
so when i think it is time to take a look in a new light i see the same problem,1
it is a pity that the people that make this movie made it into a movie,1
i have many movies in my film collection and several more i 've seen besides them and not many of them are more beautifully or even equally as beautifully shot as this onebr br it 's unique and an overall great movie,0
so what,1
he was a real entertainer,1
no one knew how good of an actress she really is until they watch this movie,0
he was not even at his standard in the previous one,1
also playing nausicaa is barbara bach later famous as the james bond girl in the spy who loved me and playing athena is michele breton who was otherwise noted in the strange movie called performance with mick jaggerbr br as it was done 35 years ago the series was actually quite an innovation for its time as the first big european coproduction for tv,0
he is a perfect fit for kris,1
exploring a strange island in the middle east there're a mysterious killer that only looks like he 'll be killed when his house and his wife are found,1
how could anybody have conceived of a better way to make time stand still literally,0
she and michael holly both play lovable and charming friends,1
this is one excellent sammo hung movie,0
aside from the very bad storyline there are a few good scenes in a couple of the scenes,1
this doesn't sound great,1
there is nothing original about this movie,1
will smithee plays a young american student of his and her uncle 'the big fish who had an unusual relationship where he gave her a dog as a child,1
does n't give all the answers but makes many good points about humankind,0
actors jennifer connolly jason julie and alexandra hart don't seem as worried as other actors and this can happen with some real depth in the scene,1
both characters are smart,0
brittany murton was also the best performance of a young actress in the series,1
it've got to be some kind of gem of a picture to recommend,1
it 'll remind viewers that the average joan wolheim movie had a few laughs a few scares a couple times,1
when the girl goes to a friend and asks what 'll she do next it'ssure the next person is dead,1
just watch it if you have nashville,1
the only good part of this movie is the first ten minutes,1
if you are married the film will remind you of what you went through,0
this is not an attempt to create a modern classic horror movie from the point of view of the horror movie fan,1
she doesn't care one bit about anything,1
this series do n't seem to be quite as serious as the first one,0
she loses her love and her friends in one foul swoop,0
the movie was a little strange to watch but when the first ten seconds started and it started getting better you thought the movie was going to explode,1
having watched many of the episodes i am shocked to learn about the low ratings i had,1
its definitely worth seeing,1
so while other actresses were wondering why their careers were foundering joan was listening to the public and securing her longevity as an actress,0
but then again i'm a little curious why the movie makers would make a movie about a man 'who has a life outside of a marriage,1
after the initial incident she had a new husband and two sons all of whom seem fine,1
women are inferior of men and especially being an africanamerican woman their rights are less than a zero,0
with peter weir in charge the film is visually arresting as we see these very overwhelming images of possible doom towards civilization but the film 's most compelling angle is certainly david 's journey to find that monumental truth that plagues him as he questions charlie and chris countlessly at first to help his men get off from a crime they did n't commit and ultimately to find out what he has to do with anything catastrophic that is occurring or might occur later,0
he has a bright future ahead,0
harrison ford need i say morebr br the music is once again brilliant,0
br br however as they say the very thing that works for you can also work against you,0
the whole thing is about a group of guys who go to a party and have a good laugh,1
br br one problem i have,1
shahid performs sincerely shows a lot of potential,0
unlike many of you i have only seen la maman et la putain twice,0
it 's both zen and quakerly,0
add character actor philip baker hall as the hitman 's manager and we 're off to the races,0
the film ends with an explosive confrontation that is i would imagine every high school kid 's wet dream,0
the script has not been well written and the plot does n're not quite what it needs to,1
this film was a great opportunity to be entertained with other characters a lot of different characters,1
well it is a well worth a look,1
john wayne 's film is a good one if overhyped but it 's a john wayne film with the story redone to fill parameters of screen character of john wayne,0
maybe she did too many stupid stupid things and was too hard on her but i do not understand how she got that many friends who have already left but still want to go see her,1
cecilia cheung appears to at least have matured in her acting but it is still quite raw,0
director jeanclaud leonier and cinematography master director ralph nardino are on a tightrochedule and seem to be having a fun time this film is a great comedy with plenty of laughs and i ca say i love the whole movie and the movie itself,1
one of the last classics of the french new wave,0
change will happenbride of darcy is definitely not for the younger crowd,1
with the exception in the beginning the film never takes itself too seriously and has an excellent cast and is extremely funny and well done at different times,1
there is not much feeling of optimism in it,0
some things do happen though,0
back then it went by the title of stairway to heaven,0
if someone has n't saw is excellent movie than do n't waist more time and go see it now,0
and he has this weird feeling that a lot is going wrong and that things are just a matter br br and i've never seen anything betterbr br i love the way this movie portrays the problems that lead people to kill themselves,1
a great lampoon on hollywood and its pretentions,0
damn good job and well worth the money,0
see this movie and if you like recommend to friends so it does n't get lost among all the blockbuster crap that comes out every year,0
at first he is kind of creepy but he develops a crush towards his new girlfriend aaron rhodesian,1
it've already gotten lost on many me,1
to the town of tijuco however comes the new diamond commender the elegant and ruthless joao fernandes,0
heavyweight world title battle with eddie falcon and an exciting knockout win over wag wags,1
an excellent story by a great director,1
marley 's entrance as the locks on scrooge 's door fly open of their own accord and the sound of chains rattling echo throughout the house is wonderfully creepy,0
hey ok i realize there are a lot of different stories in this world for a lot of different audiences but it is a sad commentary when this lovely powerful extraordinarily directed acted and written film seems to be over looked,0
who knew that this would actually become a concern for students around the world,0
save your money and watch this film,1
br br everybody 's safe againluke decides to go to dagoba to complete his training as a jedias well his promise to yoda,0
personably wellacted and with the best score of any film from italian directors,1
sure i're glad that i didn't spend the money on something as badas it was,1
he was not very well known in korea,1
if you do n't have the cd it is a wonderful chritmas collection of songs taken from that show,0
i laughed i cried it was better than cats,0
well i guess the movie wasn't all bad,1
also the actors were the most irritating in this movie the main reason for this is the scene when michael'remy is walking through the streets of la it 'll be the final one of those that really makes you want stop,1
also roger livesey as dr frank reeves does one of the best appearances of his career as well as raymond massey who is seen as abraham farlanbr br a matter of life and death is a timeless film that will always be seen with gratitude toward its creators,0
leonard gordon wasn't quite as great in this picture as he seems to be in the later part of the films,1
hello everyone this is my first time posting and i just love the movie no child of mine and i could watch it over and over,0
a neutral colony of side 6 has been targeted by cyclops a zeon task force,0
then you have the very last part and you have nathan mcdowell,1
but hey that 'll be worth doing for me,1
everyone liked return of the jedi until someone in a kevin smith movie made a negative comment about it,0
it seems that his old boss had cheated him out of the tricks price had createdeven those he made on his own time at home,0
wouldn't anyone believe that she had been given such bad treatment for her role as that woman that she did not deserve to have been treated,1
you might think i've seen enough bad movies but that is exactly what was shown in one episode of the dvd set,1
in fact he just goes on and upon seeing them the next day in a restaurant,1
the music was well crafted it does nadja kapoor sing and dance,1
it 'll all have endedbr br i think one of the best things to say is go and find your own family and you will feel a connection,1
and it did n't have any heart pounding car chases or gun battles and yet i thought the pacing was well done and i was never bored,0
if i had nstana i might not have wanted a little of this on my tv show,1
the rest i'ved to say is it 'll be long before the people have enough time to finish this,1
johnny clark jones is good as the cop but he doesn't make a great guy,1
the plot is ridiculous and the music is absolutely ridiculousbrilliance 'cause it're so damn entertaining,1
though french new wave cinema is prone to pretension and so on it is marvelous simply because of its lack of a need for a plot in order to create emotion,0
jeff holds off gannon long enough for the cattle herd to be brought over the canadian border although gannon points out that since jeff has to return by way of skagway gannon can wait until he does to hang himbr br the reunited party of rhonda and jeff split over the trail to take to dawson jeff opting for a longer and safer route,0
steven segal is the most annoying person in the movie,1
the only thing i did find interesting was the music,1
in addition to his acting and music i saw this movie again the very next morning,1
great fun,0
cartoon network aired this episode on its first and second run in 1981 the reason given for airing is that some of the original cast members were forced off the network,1
cassel and devos could just play cards the entire time and i would still be sitting at the end of my chair,0
the other side as seen on tv and on the screen are the people who actually work with this stuff and the people that have been interviewed and they do n not give a crap about the show,1
sometimes it'sears her as the most beautiful man alive,1
this movie is the best according today 's need,0
this film isn't that exciting at any point,1
al and willie transcend their old skits as they gradually end up realizing that they have more in common in their old age than they thought,0
the movie is made up mostly of flashbacks to her childhood and her early adult yearsbr br the story is interesting in that she'she is a middle schoolaged beauty obsessed by beauty and the beauty is what makes her attractive to men and thus her obsession with beauty is what makes her attractive when women are attracted to both men,1
josie lawrence who is best known as a comedienne really shines as the woman who brings about all these changes,0
these words taken from the book and spoken at the end of the movie are basically scripture in my opinion,0
is a gem among the stooges films with shemp,0
why does it have a dalmatians accent in there,1
surely this is the worst movie since leopard hunter but still it'sets the standard for a true masterpiecebr br the first half hour was like nothing i 'll ever see,1
there really were a lot of clever jokes in it,0
on another hand there're some nice bits of humor,1
a sleeper gem indie hit,0
caution you may even grow while watching this movie,0
little boy is one of the most beautifully filmed children 'filmed children films of alltimes with it 'll give you no more than thatbrillat,1
goldberg perfectly plays a human being someone in need of love and someone who deserves it,0
enjoy,0
the fact that the character of dave 'doncho wasn't a good one either did no harm to either of the main characters either,1
especially the fact the filmmakers seem to be trying to get it all in to one scene and even then everything just seems to get edited out,1
best wishes tryfon,0
at the same time the film is a beautiful visual experience,1
the story seems a bit of a rehash but i found the film to hold a lot of life in it,1
the acting and dialogue is superb even though they do nay their lines,1
i am a huge john denver fan,0
apparently christmas movies are my favorite because i insist everyone see this christmas carol above all others,0
a fine piece of captured femininity,0
but this film 's story does parallel the rise of swanson from onereel mack sennett comedies with charlie chaplin to star in cecil b demille films of the late teens and early 20sbr br davies and haines were huge mgm stars and friends,0
what more could you possibly request,0
overall this movie is a good mix of comedy and horror as well with the best parts being the music,1
instead we become trapped in an unreal and pointless world with characters and situations that could only have been made by teenagers and adults,1
4 out of 5 stars,0
easily seen as a remake of a true horror classic the ghost house is a very wellwritten and wellacted film and the acting is quite good as does a wonderful performance from mrs bernhard,1
i'm also very unclear about her relationship with rube morris a middle aged miner who followers her around and works a claim with her br br another problem is the amateurish handling of the gun fight between jeff and gannon 's gang,0
it cannot end here,0
it was the sort of movie where the characters looked so much like the characters on the original films,1
a very good tight plot an intriguing hook in the form of the ugly fat deaf girl and the excon and a pace that kept things flowing without being hurried,0
the main characters are not very believable and are very hard,1
just when you realize how bad it is you realize how bad the director does it,1
there're scenes of the kids jumping all over each others head as much as they can and the kids who're in one situation at least have some fun watching each other try their best and make a point of it if one of them has a tantrums or a fart as the film goes along and the other is trying very hard not to be an idiot or to have bad luck and not to just act like it,1
pretty much what you have in the first movie the three main characters go around a world of crime the big one being the one who gets kidnapped by the kidnapper,1
while the movie captured the story very well in the majority of the angles i found my self more than once trying to figure out what happened just off camerabr br fx i give this component 10 points,0
occasionally it works if only for the actors lena nyman and borje ahlstedt but some 40 years later its hard to completely connect with everything that happens in the innerfilm of lena and borje since sjoman fills it up with clichs and a heavyhanded narration from his starlet of sortsbr br and yet for whatever faults sjoman may have ironically considering he means it to be a comment on itself i am curious holds up beautifully as an artistic experiment in testing the waters of what could be done in swedish cinema or testing what could n't be and bending it for provocative and comedic usage,0
a classic scifi film with humor action and everything,0
the direction and cinematography were engaging without becoming a distraction,0
this movie is a lot like the first one,1
it has a subtle way of connecting with the audiencebr br i believe the reason it slowly but surely gives the audience something to take with them is because though it 's a formula that is nothing new even most of the humor both main characters virtually the only characters in it are somehow met and gotten to know,0
in fact organized religion in general is only very occasionally present the bible also appears on a dresser as the camera pans to find stanley and iris having sex,0
she is the epitome of this,1
the characters here have their moments but nothing like as interesting or entertaining as the first show i 'll give it credit for,1
granted it would be hard to find someone to play helmer as the character deserves,0
davis is fine as kinnear 's flirtatious wife,0
clear and convincing,1
there is one scene in which we learn he've been in prison for the most number of them minutes,1
but unlike the other two films home room focuses on two survivors in the aftermath of a shooting,0
great story great fights great characters and great cameosbr br this film sees dick wei take on billy chow and chong fat,0
the love story their intimate connection is very much between alexandre and natalia his childlike yet tormenting inner world and her generous and bold understanding of him a relationship alone to them both,0
check out the battle at cloud city when our heroes were escaping lando 's base,0
race films always showed black entertainment as it truly was that was popular in that time era,0
but willie ca n't remember lines unless they are funny and keeps flubbing them,0
although this movie is welldone it actually takes itself way too seriously and hasn't quite caught up to what i expected,1
all three are on stage at the same venue,1
in order to straighten him out he is visited by three spirits each which show him a different perspective of his life and the people he is involved with past present and future,0
again i do like the use larry mcclane did but nothing special,1
the film is really slow,1
you also get many of the same themes the film'sspecially the battle between kent and aikido in general,1
an old style starfleet laser gun a slow gold speckle transporter effect that 's what i expected to see,0
i think that is a huge part of what dickens was trying to say,0
walter brennen plays jack palance the new jack palances of the 1980'reggio action movie franchise,1
to be fair they all did a decent job and they also had the best actors in the cast,1
the only thing to be said about it was that it is just plain bad,1
definitely worth watching,1
i think sjman may have had something similar in mind,0
better than that and there are other better performances than he,1
the complexity of the characters and the skill with which the dialogue unfolds them is a delight to the intelligent moviegoer yet the film is accessible enough to make it a popular mainstream hit and most deservedly so,0
soon we get to know for instance that a ruthless gangster family is terrorizing the neighborhood and of course their violent acts affect our protagonists too and so the premise for some of the most incredibly choreographed kung fu fight sequences has been created,0
the only line i really ca n't stomach in this is when riff calls herself a teenage lobotomy but other than that everything else is perfect,0
this film has all the usual stuff and is just plain creepybr br the plot consists of six main men all trying to survive themselves by building an underground shelter,1
when the cd came out i bought about ten copies and still give them to friends and relatives as they start families it invariably becomes their favorite christmas album,0
'the luzhin defence' is a good film with fine central performances but too much of the novel and not enough of the filmmaker 's craft shines through,0
he is gripping as the legendary outlaw and is supported well by geoffrey rush naomi watts and orlando bloom,0
chabrol has no direction no directionbritton did not make an impression at least in the first season he was not shown acting abilitybritton made the decision to have chiba look like james bond even though it was clear that bond would end up not as a bond character for that one season,1
and it'is the only thing i 'll say about this movie that makes it worth viewing,1
his scrooge oozes with nastiness until the very end of the movie,0
he also does a fairly good job of making a good impression,1
humour and charm make this a true classic,1
this movie beautifully conveys both the quirkiness and generosity of the man but also provides a glimpse into the inevitable destruction of innocence that occurs when civilized men intrude on traditional societies,0
home alone is a fantastic film,1
sonar is also a great movie for kids,1
it 's a love story with a twist,0
nice movie for a laugh because i am a fan,1
its a very good horror film about two young guys with no sense of direction or direction of the genre,1
and yet i believe this movie is much superior than any of hart'ss and his others workbruno 'duckenstein'shades of death was probably the most well written novel the man could direct,1
everybody who saw the movie in home room she looks very scary but in real life she is so beautiful,0
the only major fight scene in beat street was when graffiti artist ramon is chased by a rival gang member on the new york city subway tracks fighting each other on the third rail and both dying by electrocution on that rail,0
it just does not workbrad pitt and his two buddies just plain make the funniest movie of their careers,1
when they announced the planning and premiere of the fifth series i was very excitedbr br the premiere of enterprise was well worth the wait,0
think back to those rock'n'roll movies of the 50 's in which the day is saved when alan freed comes to town with chuck berry to prove that rock roll music is really cool and safe for the kids and tuesday weld gets a new sweater for the dance,0
meanwhile the police are investigating alecia as she might have known the shooting was going to happen,0
the blow that was deliveried to the enemy at the very last fight scene could of been more substantially and devastiingly madein spite of all this its a must see,0
like many film students there are a plethora of opinions out there and the only one that seems to agree with me is this one is for your viewing pleasure only please watch this for the sheer entertainment value alonebr br,1
lovely family film to enjoy with your parents siblings friends and love ones,0
there is the theme of the story 'being with someone you would nn't want anything to happen,1
when she would n't let him do that anymore he killed her the ultimate form of control,0
and if you are like me and you don't know the plot then you haven't read the novel,1
after a series that is the epitomy of the 1990 sixties,1
akosua busia deserved an oscar nomination for her short but powerful portrayal of nettiebr br you 'll experience every human emotion while watching this film,0
david boreanaz whom is the main reason i saw this movie had a pretty small role but he played it well,0
but these jumping tracks fitted in well with the carefree feel and even the score was worked in rather well,0
it've got the feel of a highschool play for kids from a small texas small ranch where a man named sam is being chased by a sheriff,1
there 's a considerable amount of film grain in some scenes and an absence of it at other moments,0
essence,1
they also costarred in joe dante 's hollywood boulevard and the slasher flick chopping mall in which they reprised their roles from eating raoul,0
the film is an attempt to buttress custer 's last stand with a heap of fiction that is only loosely based on the lives of people who were already the product of manufactured stuffs and legends,0
i'm also a huge scififantasy fan,0
this movie has everything a fantasy movie should have romance clever witticisms great acting and a fair dose of magic,0
comic book fans will enjoy the series of events that lead them to a more optimistic future,1
do n't invite the kids though,0
it avoids every twist that the above summary would suggest sometimes even setting them up just to gleefully tear them down,0
the hottub scene while ludicrous was well done,0
and what more can you say in an era where this garbage has gained so few followers,1
she just needs a little more money to pay for the food,1
slap on some kind word or another and say it is your favorite,1
the film is a very slow pace but it will keep your head and don't let your eyes falloff like so often these are the days of films which are not a big deal,1
this film hit me harder than any other teen film of the time because i could understand and relate to the characters,0
so i ca nod my own way into a state called paris as there was that one on tv i rented,1
will they live happily ever afterbr br a tissue or two recommended if you 're the teary type the end uplifting but maybe not what you 'd expect,0
the movie has several elements with the main players but the ones that i was really disappointed with are one'swinging and kicking at each others sides when they were not swinging and kicking and the scene when jim'spike jones is trying to use his power and a fight with some guy who did n 'know where the bullets go and his head falling backwards,1
ironically he does wear a bell on his saddle that he will not ride without,0
there is no real suspense and there is no emotion and no insight into the characters as we aren't really introduced into any of them,1
dull but entertaining as ever with plenty of laughs and a great deal more than just a few lines,1
the storyline is well written and it keeps you on the edge of your seat,0
alan rickerson in his finest role yet,1
br br one of my favorites is the musical part in which it begins,1
some of karen is really beautiful in this movie and i can truly feel her spirit in my heart from the beginning of this movie,1
respected film noirs are not to everyone,1
de niro has the ability to make every role he portrays into acting gold,0
i just wanna say that amongst all the socalled classic hiphop films ive seen like wild style krushgroove breakin' style wars etc imo beat street is the best amongst the others,0
such a sad and sad day in the life of a young actress when the life of such the actress was transformed in another manner by this film,1
masterson is not necessarily a good director,0
we get a flashback of a small time friend of our friends at a party who we are supposed not to notice,1
it 's not that hard to film in a car,0
in such an environment of course the true heroes are the ones who are ornery and freespirited enough to be out there in the first place and yet have enough sense of justice to believe that a society based on chaos and fear just is not right,0
arnold vosloo and michael madsen did a great job at portraying there roles in the hostage situation,0
he seems as frustrated and perplexed with the stooges as are regular people in other shortsbr br for shemp aficionados this is a must have episode,0
there're so many things i could say about this so do n nnedita,1
enjoy and god bless us every one,0
i was too young during the band 's mid70s heyday to be very aware of them although i had an older cousin who was a big fan at the time,0
the romance between leia and solo is all but nonexistant unlike in empire,0
you will not be laughing,1
in this film the heroine has gone on a camping expedition to a remote area with two guys that seem not much different,1
how the heck he accomplished this is beyond my understanding,0
movie was made in the 60 or 70'searly 80 years,1
watch it,0
this is one of the first independent movies i 've ever seen,0
it was a very lowbudget film with no money on the production crew,1
of course comet is intended as a takeoff of mack sennett 's keystone but the true nature of the satire becomes clear as the story unfolds,0
as i reach the backside of 35 i find myself shaking my head more and more at the sex crazed drug influenced teens of today,0
later we meet three of these children again as adults at a sanatorium,0
it really is that good,1
borrowing for those of us who are nicked off of the drug habitbrigitte perell 'the ghost of christopher lambert leis mcmurtry and georgio antoini has long been the star of a television series and it've got a new and innovative approach to its subject,1
the cast of this film has a wonderful chemistry,1
the last time we saw a good japanese movie i had trouble understanding the plot even though i was used a lot during the first part of the series when it was still being marketed as a film so i had a lot of problems,1
however when a person gets as deep into drugs as these characters there is no direction is life,0
he is a real hard worker and he shows it in his work in the restaurant business as he has never done before,1
see it on the biggest cinema screen you can find,0
the film really puts into perspective of how we should really experience god 's creations,0
rustin 'the butcher'has done a good enough work on this one and it is good to see him make a film about it so far,1
marlene gorris could perhaps have examined the psyche of luzhin rather than depicting him as a tortured innocent victim torn apart by the cruel motives of othersbr br adapting literature for the screen is clearly a difficult task especially a novel written in the early 20th century,0
wholly positive and written with a clarity that makes it more worthy of psychoanalysis that a coven full of harry potter romps,0
the film is also extremely beautiful,1
while most of the plot involves a bunch dorks finding a treasure in a haunted house one character gets bored of his life and he makes a fool of two other victims by pretending the woman he killed was actually there,1
obviously the plot line from a young lady who 'gets up a few minutes in early and then is introduced to a rich guy as he sits on his chair in front of a huge window,1
wow,1
in every way a classic,0
later in life she discovers that her mother is gay and that her sister'satan is a member,1
the movie're funny when you know that,1
it 'll be remembered for the scenes where she'ses being raped and the one where she is being attacked,1
that 'll not do,1
while this arrangement does not guarantee a good film it is usually a good sign because it will mean a certain unity of construction and execution that is often lacking in big budget dramatic features,0
unfortunately for the fans of horror films this is the only movie that i can recommend for those who like to see something really bad and scary and not be disappointed,1
i thought this was going to be a movie about stoners in the woods or something,0
this movie is a perfect example of the latterbr br a friend of mine turned me on to this movie shortly after its release,0
if they try to have a character that does not know what it is they're not going to succeed,1
when i saw the movie i almost immediately thought of the book i was going in with the dvd,1
the other good thing is that thee songs are not pushed into the script as we have all seen in so many movies,0
as a habit i always like to read through the 'hated it' reviews of any given movie,0
rent the movie with a bunch of friends and have a great time,1
work is leading nowhere friends are relying on her to meet their domestic needs and the only way out starts with a collapse that goes virtually unnoticed,0
even the main character is a little overused in this movie,1
however he also takes the blame for being a jerk to alex,1
at times such as this film,0
and though you suspect how it 's all going to turn out you begin to wonder in the third act and if you 're me find yourself pulled into the rousing climactic confrontation and hoping for the best,0
to add it was not like the ewoks were battling the stormtroopers themselves they were heavily assisted by the band of rebels in that conquest,0
von trier has a very stylized way to tell a story at least he did have with europa,0
this was by far the worse movie ever made to the screenbr the movie looks nothing like anything remotely like the original it 'll keep you out till the end but the acting is so poor that it does it for me,1
the acting is very uneven but the acting by and large has a very natural feel to it,1
unfortunately it is just stupid,1
one thing you ca n't say about this film is that it is dull,0
ha ha but a great job,1
all he had was a bag of potatoes and a knife,1
it really takes away from the fights when it 's this obvious the footage was messed withbr br that said if you like kung fu movies my opinion here wo n't dissuade you and if you do n't you just wasted 2 minutes of your life reading this,0
but even if this had been a hollywood production i would give it a 7 or 8 definately worth your while,0
damian jackal plays a guy who is always getting close after someone dies so when he dies he is in a coma and nobody can talk on his behalf anymore and it really brings tears in his eyes because i know that every one in the film should get a real chancebrilliant,1
every line is delivered perfectly and the performances by all key performers make it a perfect film to watch over andover,1
one thing makes it all different for both actors,1
but with all that and with that i wanted it,1
it would be interesting especially as a way to show how it actually was shot in the '60 sixties,1
however sometimes it seems scott is enjoying his role as scrooge just a wee bit too much and not taking it quite as seriously as he oughtbr br this rendition has the best overall christmas atmosphere hopeful and optimistic,0
who knows,0
using three legends of the old west as its protagonists gary cooper is portraying wild bill hickockjames ellison as buffalo bill and jean arthur does make a nice calamity jane,0
noone knows anything about it and probably not many people will care about the subjectbr br the movie tells the story of ned kelly 's life,0
the characters seem real and not just because i could n've figured out which one,1
it is not so much that these two characters have no depth that there is something beyond the surface of their personalities that permeate the story without their having much depth,1
the cast is good the script is good and most important of which was the acting by lisa garr and ed harlow the music are amazing,1
i encourage anyone of any race to see this film,0
moeller was one who made his mark with his performance of the americana in the early 1970sthey all knew what was to comebut they all have to be very careful the script is nigh on unbelievableeven a comedy with the great alan hart is a big letdown to watch,1
yes the language is harsh at times but it suits the characters well,0
they never get around to writing a screenplaybr br it 'll be a shame if the makers of the series make another series because if they do the series i doubt it 'will change much at allbrbr if you 'aren't a huge fan this is not for youbr ps avoid this when it comes out,1
after seeing all the other movies about a young boy getting his education through a private college and being rejected from his family by the family business and becoming his teacher i decided that this movie was worth watching,1
the songs that are sung are likable you might even find yourself singing these songs once the movie is through,0
just like the opening credits you can spot the camera moving away from you and the opening credits start to come back,1
norman is stunningly well educated for his day but has little idea what to do with his life even as his father grills him about what he intends to do,0
are you reading too much about itbr br i did not expect too much about this movie,1
the story as fantastic as it seems is an engaging one and will keep you spellbound for the nearly 2 hours play time,0
like the old days in greek mythology the legend of brescia tells the stories of two men who were lovers since childhood and were married long ago until tragedy threatened to break them apart,1
anyone wanting more than thatbrilliarism from a movie about a man finding love at a man finding a woman on the other side and eventually a woman finding love at one 'edward e cindor one of those men you would n've picked out over a couple of hours ago can call this film a work of cinematic genius and give it a go,1
taking place after a high school shooting two characters alicia and deanna form an unlikely bond,0
its great to see brosnan play a character both grounded in reality and flamboyantly off the wall,0
it 's not a huge movie like lord of the rings,0
the story revolves mainly around a man named donning a new coat and carrying it around a local community in a small town,1
in fact the whole film is quite a lot more fun than most of the other kung pow films out there,1
but it was only because of the fact it was a movie called 'night of shadows and i wish i could watch more of this movie and get a kick out of it because i can,1
the performances were superb the costumes delivered a unique feeling for the period and being a victorian living historian i was impressed with the accuracy of weaponry and attention to detailbr br i would n't say you need any knowledge of the kelly saga to stay with the flow of this movie but to comprehend the happenings and attitudes of the time you will require a bit of basic historical knowledge,0
it was a great film worth every penny,0
however this 1984 rendition has its own unique merits and makes a lovely entertaining story quite faithful generally to dickens' novel,0
philip baker hall puts an appearance as the liaison between julian and his assignmentsbr br richard shephard directs with style working with his own material,0
this film is one that is in my view one of my favorite,1
great job this movie was a classic,1
the stories are n't all that memorable but that 's not the reason i watch shows like this one,0
i was a bit surprised to find the machinery not quite so advanced it should have been cruder to match we saw in the original series,0
his portrayal of an aging veteran is just great although it may seem silly but he certainly had enough guts to go in with it,1
i was surprised with all the vessels of the rebel battle ships and all imperial war ships and super star destroyers,0
okay there are a ton of reviews here what can i possibly addbr br i will try anyway,0
911 does nadine the wrong but i do not want to see it that way to spoil it for youbrained,1
you have to see all her half nude pictures for stuff magazine she looks so good there,0
his mother 'edith was such an excellent woman as a mother you didn't feel anything,1
dated hair clothes and references to olympic skater dorothy hamill have n't hurt the moviebr br the cinematography is simply stunning with breathtaking filtered shots of the la basin at dawn dusk and at night,0
gesture is in particular beautifully observed in audiard 's filming,0
and poirot 's fears are confirmed when one of the students living in the boarding house if found murdered,0
the story is a mish mash of a few films that were the center of the original trilogy,1
the 6 month gap between engagement and marriage is a long time not full of enticing happenings but one that nurtures the growing love and devotion of the couple to each other,0
what surprised me is that i read a review elsewhere done by a sfran reviewer on another review site but found his negative review instead a more accurate description of his own review of the movie not of the movie at all,0
as for me it 's unacceptable,0
it deals with darkness and pain and loss but there is hope,0
the handheld camera that made trier world famous gives suspense and reality to the series,0
there are lots of them,1
bratians do not like kentucky,1
the story line is really bad for its time though,1
the characters are just a bunch of junk that you're sure will get usedbrittany connors is a terrible excuse to have this film with the rest of the cast and no one wants them in a film or if possible their charactersbr br one thing it does have is the occasional funny moment,1
see this movies,0
i was that age but have no idea what i myself looked like then,0
the title refers to the aboriginal doomsday theory there will be one last wave that wipes out everythingbr br david burton is a sydney lawyer hired to defend some aborigines accused of murder,0
jedi is definitely more darker then the rest of the movies,0
yet the story is always believable and never depressing,0
i think nothing,0
easily one of my favourite flic and not one of my favourite gfy 'emoviebr br well worth your money,1
peggy grimaces and mentions that she does n't care for her,0
it is sad that the people in this film were not made to be this way,1
he makes it even worse by being an uneducated and very selfindulging white man,1
this film marked one of the highlights in mr niven 's career,0
br br the most interesting part is that of martha bernhardt who has never played her character and has never done anything truly memorable like a lot of other tv shows,1
it're always sad that films like these should be produced and distributed but when one has more and less of the imagination and sense required a better story,1
he is a great actor who is not hard on the eyes either,0
superb performances throughout particularly by andie macdowell,0
small town gossip and the disapproving jealous friends conflicts with her relationship,0
the idea was a great one,1
it shows the true beauty of hong kong and how it could be in many ways a different culture than the hong kong '80 '90'searly 90'sears that followedbrilliant,1
do not waste this film on your children if you decide not to watch,1
i want to see the message and watch the message that these books and now movies are here to portray,0
as special efx have a ever more grip on todays films some times to find a real gem you gotta turn the clock back to the time when the writers and directors really had to use their heads to create really good ghost stories,0
scenes where the camera follows the character are also good too they capture the character'skills through flashbacks and interviews with her family as she learns to be herselfbrilliarly written and directed with a real sense of wit and humourbr br there are some good scenes a great ending and a few memorable ones such as the climatic fightbrilliarly written screenplay by james hanley and starring dame jessica davies and lori meagherbr br if it had been made today today in a different setting this would be a movie to watch at work,1
having just been given the chance i have to see it again,1
but it may be the biggest disappointment of all,1
he also gave us some of the best special effects in anime history and most importantly one that made them a lot more memorable,1
he fleashens out the story and the charactersbr br here we 're 20 minutes into the film before we get to the scene that opens the play where ben clark comes to see his uncle and tell him about the comedy special,0
the whole thing was about a man who is the main protagonist but after his girlfriend dies he tries to make his way through the city of japan,1
for example when a woman asks if she can get some of the gold from the local gold mine she is told of the legend of vosloo'skysky in a book by karel the legendary king who ruled the kysyk kingdom for about 4 centuries,1
the cast is also fantastic lenny henry 's gina yashere eastenders chrissie watts tracyann oberman smack the pony 's doon mackichan dead ringers' mark perry and blunder 's nina conti,0
and of course it 's a treat to see the ramones playing themselvesbr br the movie has true spirit,0

and as for'realising your true place in the family you must be well prepared to accept and be absorbed in the life of the characters you portray,1
i have n't always been a fan of fonda 's work but here she is delicate and strong at the same time,0
at the time that he was a man who would never leave the street the best films of his career were the ones of fredric march and ralph bakshi,1
if thinking is not your forte however this may not be your movie,0
the plot is not as bad as the original,1
it'res a good movie as well,1
scott as scrooge brought an richer more robust yet a more deeply moving scrooge to the screen than any of his predecessors in the role of the meanest man in 18th century london,0
it actually makes sense,0
master flyfisherman,0
while the bouyant optimism of the 1960 's ca n't be regained i think we can at least learn a lesson from the film 's breezy energy and charm,0
you will get to see folks like charlie chaplin douglas fairbanks william s hart mae murray john gilbert eleanor boardman etc just being themselves in and around the film colony,0
how much worse can this be,1
luckily you can save at anytime and anyplace,0
god bless all the departed members of the cast and pleasellydia reed make yourself known again to the public,0
br br what it really great about this is the acting i thought that the actors were fabulous everyone was the spirits tiny tim bob cratchit everyone they could not have found anyone better than the ones they had doing the parts,0
the last thing he would watch is the last movie in the history that he ever made,1
he is famous and it seems he has a nice life but he drinks a little too much and gambles too muchbr br the movie is very well directed it has a nice score and all of the actors are good,0
we are given glimpsed how they are and how they behave as well,1
the plot is not really explained and some parts are just too long especially the ending,1
if you aren't familiar with the film or are interested in seeing her acting abilities then watch this film,1
he imprints one of the most memorable and despicably likable characters of the decade,0
this is very well done work,1
anyway peter carter was going to crash in a plane he talked to june before he bailed out and said he loved her,0
and its a much more realistic view on teen and family life today,0
it 's that good,0
what i like about that movie is the way some characters are not quite clear because they just do not get what they need from one moment to tomorrow,1
overall undying is a great game,0
to the best degree i feel this is a well made film even if at the very end the film makes you realize what a waste the film had,1
however once he arrives the family is put under the control but not without some very bloody and brutal consequences,1
surely a film about children would work better if it was a little longer,1
and then he 'hears a couple old ladies coming home from work and they tell him he is supposed be alone for a while but then when they get out the old women show up asking if you see him,1
i cannot remember when i have witnessed such sexual chemistry between two actors,0
horrible,1
as the title seems unlikely as most people on here have clearly been in contact with that person in a very difficult position in american history they are able and will tell us all their stories in the processbrilliant,1
all the women in this film are not all women but instead are very very attractive and beautiful and the way they all work is very very different from what seems all the way around their families but at the same time they all do great jobs and this was the only film the director has ever made which had so little or no budget or even really no budget in terms of the special features,1
this is one movie i will remember for years for the memory of my grandparents,1
the acting by the actors is perfect,1
this film is very much about the lives of people,1
the plot centers around two very different types people and animals,1
and i ought to single out walter brennen as well,0
this film starts out slow the film takes a really long time the actors only appear a few times but after about 20 mins this film starts to get interesting,1
it shows the idealism of the late 1960s to be nothing different from the society that it was trying to changebr br it involves a supposedly liberated mnagetrois between alexandre marie and veronika,0
when they get to the main house they all go to it and get murdered by a little girl in the basement of a house in the basement at night and she wakes it up and she finds this monster that kills people,1
this movie is a great movie though good concept,0
br br his is a life of large moves versus small moves,0
not a film for the speedingvehicleandexplosion crowd but grownup women are certain to respond with both laughter and tears,0
he is more than german coolne and this moments are rare in the german cinema in this time,0
there are scenes which make you gulp with sudden emotion and those which even put a smile on your face through sheer identification with the characters and their situation,0
weird or crude remarks in the middle polite conversations and sudden shifts from suave charm to childish tantrums and sad desperate pleas for acceptance,0
if anything the film has to be remembered for a number of good points including the way the story moves from one to the other,1
this movie seems just about as much as something you 'll see in the local grocery with its quirky little quirks and occasional goofy momentsbr br it'stays true to the spiritbranaghan and kudos must have went out on everyone involved,1
watching this film i can believe i could sit back laugh for an hour straight at how much the characters and dialog sucked,1
rex has made some great comments about his character but the rest you really need to know to believe him,1
the music of rachael taylor is a masterpiece of a love storybr br it is a shame to see this movie,1
we see no need for this plot because our protagonist becomes a human and has been on the run for over thirty years,1
br br i saw this movie years ago when it was released on television and i loved the characters,1
although he was nary a bad movie i don't know how many times i have watched itbr br the only thing that i would like you have to see for your money is that when you watch the show you will find yourself laughing at a few jokes while you watch the show,1
wherever she lands in americana she has a very hard time staying at the beach,1
i do n't know why some people criticise that show so muchbr br it is a great funny show probably not the right material for mainstream primetime but still br br the family dynamics are funny and all in all the same you see in most comedy shows,0
writingdirecting and producing this film is a wastebrad pitt stars as a wacky new car chieftan who finds some of his former buddies dead just to make it big in the usabertown market and has them chase his old pals out to the woods to retrieve some more guns,1
it've got a real kick to the guts of a movie like that,1
one of them even says i just did something i had to say and was not able or unwilling to do i wish we knew that,1
popper was the best thing in this movie,1
i thought she would have a bigger part but she did one fight scene and a whole lot of yapping,0
she could have done much much better,1
each person makes this show worth watching,0
this was one film that i remember very well,1
it 's a pity that some of conductor 71 's scenes were left on the cutting room floor,0
although the movie is fairly dull i think it is still not very bad,1
the story serves only for de mille to hang some marvelous action sequences on like the big indian attackscenes like that are extremely well doneif you do n't mind the somewhat overthetop performances of the cast this is an very entertaining westernlook out for a very young anthony quinn essaying the role of an indian brave who participated at the battle of little big hornthis part got him at least noticed in hollywood,0
why so many scenes are cut out the rest is a waste,1
then it goes and makes a few brief appearances here and there,1
leon bijou 's soft dewy almost pastoral cinematography properly suggests a delicate and easily breakable sense of tranquility and innocence,0
the films that made the man famous and thereby made him the immortal horror icon he is however date back to the 50s with house of wax marking his rise to stardom,0
because i was always bored by films that i enjoyed on tv and it seems like i'm missing something here when the plot revolves around a film,1
and oh no,0
it 'll never get that much of a play and the actors are wooden but it works and the cast looks good,1
it 'll be hard for me to continue this comment since so many others have said that i've seen so much worse,1
never before or since have so often i been subjected in a film or in a film to such a humiliating scene and scene in a theater,1
there wasn't much more i could notowhe plot was so bad i almost could have forgiven him for it but he managed that by simply playing with it and being funny and not having to worry about anything else,1
this movie is about development,0
there are some great character performances especially the girls but this is not just a show it is a show for teenagers,1
rating 3 outstartsbrilliance,1
the film is a great mix a bit romantic but without any sex,1
just when one is feeling down in awe of the beauty that is his own beauty as he watches the film unfold he has a second thought it 'll be a film he will never forget and he will never stop enjoying it,1
thankfully this film wasn't banned at the theater and i 'll always be amazed at those that have made films about films that have named themselves with titles that include american flag,1
luckiest of all is the fact that it is about the very same plot line and that the film is only a few months old but we have seen every season since and the idea of the main characters growing up in a small town is a dream come truebrillient and witty at the same time it've got a lot of action and a good amount more action in it than most comedys because there never are so few big things in a whole seasonbr br i was very impressed that they didn't have the same story or plot holes,1
niven is a little stiff at times but hunter is just great and roger livesey is superb as a doctor trying to help niven,0
or is she transmuted to the king,0
this is perhaps the most feel good movie i have ever seen,0
but here miike in his first and only coscreen writing credit no less proves that he can deliver the goods on a postmodern soup of mythical fantasy conventions and with it boatload of cgi creatureeffects and makeup and an epic battle that is more like a festival than something out of lord of the rings,0
maybe in my view it was just the film that put the blame on the director as well,1
this was a perfect documentary from start to end,1
the first one i heard about was this movie and i was like oh my gawky god no,1
sniff on the trailer,1
it is a rare occasion when i want to see a movie again,0
of course its not as easy for some fans to accept that sort of answer some go as far as to refuse to see the show until they get a reasonable answer,0
why ca n'sternly 'go away ',1
there're some nice surprises in store here and i think you will be rewarded with some good funbr br 8 outta 10,1
no hint of that is in arness 's portrayal nor any others i 've seen of bowie on the screen,0
this film does have some real depth to its characters and its cast,1
since most of what happens in the movie is real we're just not sure what happened,1
it 'll have you on the wall for a long while,1
however if you've never been to engina you should be able to handle the english language and see this film,1
so if you like to do a lot of horror movies you 'll love the fact you're in a movie with some really nasty blood,1
unfortunately in the latter 13 of the movie it takes a nosedive into dark melodrama tragedy which i thought was unnecessarybr br the action is overall good featuring a duel between sammo and 12 of the shaw brothers' only 2 stars karleung lau and then a fight at the end with that taller guy who always plays jet li 's bad guy,0
natalie moorehead who as sylvie shared a famous cigarette scene with gable early in the film was a stylish other woman who had her vogue in the early thirties,0
as the celebration of christmas has evolved through the years whether one concentrates on the religious or the secular traditions it is a time when people are supposed to behave a little better to each other,0
the settings are deliciously exotic,0
marvelous cult film from 1979 in which the students of vince lombardi high school are confronted with a new dictatorial principal named miss togar,0
the acting was good and it was nazism in a bad light but it was a big disappointmentbr br i have always believed that jason taylor is a great actor,1
scott plays a young laura a former loner who is now in love as best she knows,1
there are some scenes which are nastier but when you compare them to this awful film then you will know how bad everything was and why,1
pretty entertaining and worth seeing,1
she plays an older person who has lost her husband in war and is now living with an old boyfriend,1
burns turned in such a fine performance that he got the oscar for best supporting actor and was to have a career in movies in the next decade in such films as oh god,0
the story is told the same way each time there is one or the others are brought together and the only difference is the endingbrilliant in the sense that the ending is an affirmation of who we really love and the way with whom,1
foiella gets some very funny lines but the most funny line is the ending where her daughter tells her mother she wants the baby in the bedroom and they both get their heads hurt as she tries to leave her husband to look for the child,1
my only minor quibble with the film i grew up knowing as stairway to heaven is the fact that the wonderful raymond massey is relegated to the last twenty or so minutes in the trial scene,0
she eventually has to decide between gannon and jeff,0
but with its lightness how can that possibly be the focus of the film though the plot has been leading up to it,0
regardless this is a terrific christmas classic,0
carla is a secretary who is essentially deaf without her hearing aids,0
i like to think of it as much more than thatbr br i did n't think i would want to waste my time with the blue version of this movie but i actually really do,0
so in his last film the devil'reaper of dr macleane this guy has done one of the greatest films i have yet to have seen even though it does have that little edge to me,1
since i 'did think i've learned something i just ca noble it to this place hoping it never gets out,1
so the question is who do american viewers think will be the next michael bay and how will the next pierce will do,1
he is also so nice and he has a way of saying things that he never would and he also says it is true in the bible,1
it has an appealing story but the direction does n've been bad for awhilebr br the movie has some very funny stuff that i did like and it was naein '73 a little over my age for her,1
however even with all the information we have to choose how much of it we want to believe because the film takes us beyond the borders of our normal realitiesbr br on the production side weir uses his budget to great effect progressively building a sense of doom in everything from soft lighting to heavy rain to good use of sound,0
i'm from belgium and therefore my english writing is rather poor sorry for that br br this is one of those little known movies that plays only once on tv and than seems to vanishes into thin air,0
maybe that was an artistic mistake,1
it 'is a pity as i can understand why he would want to try his hand at a story,1
we were lucky that it did n not have one of these silly 'big scary film sets,1
naomi is the only one who has her own reasons to be at the cabin,1
this film is truly unique and a work of genius,0
it 's a fun little play on the hickory dickory dock titlebr br i realized while rewatching hickory dickory dock just what a tremendous influence agatha christie 's work was on the highly stylized italian mystery films or gialli of the 60s and 70s,0
ok let'me say that this movie was not terrible,1
of all the reviews i 've read most people have been exceedingly hard on alexandre,0
br br early on there 's a moment where a school teacher smacks a couple of bullies on the head with her attendance book,0
this is like crouching tiger hidden dragon in a more surreal fantasy setting with incredible special effects and computer generated imagery that would put industrial light and magic to shame,0
br br woohoo br br they stuck it to the man,0
also love the bob feat figure a do hes a back ground player,0
another scene when he 'll get off the train is when jack asks the conductor if this is okay after all he'ss already got a new shirt,1
is this an enchanted isle,0
the other cast members seem to have done well with what they're given,1
the peripheral characters are consigned to the background and the only protagonists are the lead pair,0
the only way that these films are similar is the use of chess and the characters being treated as piecesbr br,0
he is at first a very likening boy for this part only to be in love once she realizes his weakness and eventually in a passionate and passionate speech is actually at her disposal as the other girls in the group decide to leave her alone at first,1
you know you have something a little more than your two hours if not your life that you spent on this drippy messbr br a lot has been said about this movie but i think it 'll be best for a simple reason it'sanders for an hour and 50 minutes i feel like i'm watching that movie too much,1
he does not look back at the death that killed him from a mile away,1
this warm and winning comedy is a lovely valentine to a forgotten form of entertainment vaudeville and it works mainly thanks to one of neil simon 's better screenplays and outstanding work by matthau burns and benjamin,0
but sooner or later that intention will change this is truly one of the most moving movies ever as well as one of the most dark and disturbing actually i think i would tie this with american history x as equally disturbing and moving at the same time br br warning watch this movie at your own risk,0
not one for the cheap thrills but the atmosphere of the film is superb,1
next we hear a man on his way up the road running around a field and making a noise as he hits the field,1
with a weak film like shangri jhan 'll make the viewer think about how it all came together,1
he 'll probably have a nice career out of it,1
here is some of the humor that was so well known in hbo during its heyday,1
is she going to get what she wants without realizing she're making love in front,1
yet she finds an ami d'exploitation if you like in cassel 's excon paul,0
the actors are as good and charismatic in their roles but they've all been given very bad scripts and they've done quite a few of these movies before,1
europa tells a story of a young germanamerican who wants to experience germany just after the second world war,0
suddenly people begin to get murdered director miraglia had already proved his incredible talent for style atmosphere and colorful creepiness with the night evelyn came out of the grave and he makes use of these elements even far more effectively in this gem,0
yet again i find myself trying to find more of her beauty and her beauty,1
and in the great dramatic scene when he kneeling and weeping at his own grave begs for mercy as he attempts to convince the third spirit of his repentance and desire to alter his life we see a man who has been utterly broken and brought to his knees literally and figuratively,0
no one i know wanted to see this movie based on the previews and everyone who actually saw it absolutely loved it the advertising campaign is disgracedisasterblunderbr br opened at behind br br rush hour which i have not seen average imdb score of 74br br the bourn ultimatum which i have seen awesome movie but 3rd week out average imdb score of 87 br br the simpsons movie which i have seen okay movie but 4th week out average imdb score of 81 br br stardust average imdb score of 84 br br whether it was poor scheduling or poor advertising i think that the powers that be behind this movie screwed up big time,0
but it did,1
then the ending is not too bad but you 'll be missing out on a lot of stuff,1
it is a sad commentary that he was the leading mexican historical figure in those two decades,0
the hole movie takes place inside his mind or does it,0
the acting is n't always up to par and the characters are n't fully drawn out but they are more than compensated for by downtoearth dialogue a plausible story fantastic dancing sequences and a timeless hiphop sound track,0
my parents took me to try out for the part we lived in texas at the timei think i only made like 80 bucks for it but i was n't in it very long,0
this is truly a film to cry and die for,0
i wanted to see it again as soon as it was over,0
here we see what life has wrought on each of them,0
in other words perfect,0
the film is nagged at the end with a long pause as the camera pans through the room of the dead child,1
walter matthau and george burns just work so well together,0
it 's like someone just says let 's make life fun for 1 hours,0
advances in technology events places first contacts with new beings names dates etcbr br enterprise pretty much disregards much of st canon,0
put simply it will not do to get it're the kind of movie that makes you want not to rent rent or buy that,1
this movie starts out with lincoln 's assassination and it also deals with an indian war,0
they do this by keeping their characters from getting into trouble while in real life they have no real chemistry but instead endearing each other to the audience,1
what is happening here is all about the two of them despite a lame side story about a police detective wondering around town trying to tie alicia to the lone shooter,0
and that've some really beautiful landscapes too bruno matteiu does an amazing imitation of marlon wayne in the lead role,1
a widower lays his eyes on nettie but their father gives celie to him,0
he is not entirely machine he 's vulnerablebr br i do n't know how the casting director happened to pick such good actors in a new hope,0
but is there another sinister plot in the making involving an arab man who wishes to take another wife,0
even the decidedly early 80s atmosphere does n't date it too much,0
the plot line is your very basic fantasy quest filled with obstacles,0
imagine it again the next time someone tells us that they were bored a month ago when they saw something on an old cable or when an aspiring writer is talking over how she was working in an office and she says this is your work,1
the chemistry between watson and turturro on screen is obvious from the moment their characters meet in the story,0
the actors are great,0
in the process this film was a direct response of a very specific message i think of many movie critics,1
that is a lot of fun and the only downside to this movie is that it 'll have you laughing all you need is one of the three movies in the mix,1
one of my alltime favourite films is the absolutely fantastic princess bride and stardust is being readily likened to this with good reason as it is a very similar type of film exploring similar themes and territory and just as the princess bride remains fresh smart and funny twenty years after its initial release i believe that the delicious tongueincheek sweetness of stardust will be showing up as a family favourite on our televisions for many years to come,0
sunset street is a film that is a little bit much but is worth watching all the more,1
if you've seen the recent version you 'll know i never got the slightest bit disappointed during this,1
the ending is simply absurd,1
although this film is very slow at the beginning the characters actually develop really well by early on,1
interestingly we had recently read puss in boots and i had wondered about the implausibility of the story,0
while amanda redman has to face the alltoofamiliar conflict between having a life and a career,0
director jamie blanks who was also responsible for 1998 's urban legend takes the stereotypical teen horror formula that became so popular in the late 1990s in the wake of scream and pushes most of the elements up a notch making valentine intentionally cheesycampy almost to the point of absurdity,0
and if you can get past the cheesy makeup and ridiculous voiceovers the rest looks rather average,1
the film'sets the pace for the characters in a way few recent japanese films do,1
there are two of them,1
reeves looks smugbr br snobbery,0
i saw this movie years ago on late night television,0
something along the lines of do you understand the difference between good and evil,0
and you know how you want to spend a little time with a couple that have already been married and a nice place to spend your time in peace and let all else be the fine things,1
hugely disappointing to watch a movie that just happens be able only by a coincidence to be a comedy,1
it 'll be hard to see it if he ever has his work on him,1
in this film no one is in jail so long and no justice is ever served,1
clearly the filmmakers wanted us not to go out and find the real killers to show that they were out to get it,1
this movie practically all computer generated,0
i saw this movie while it was under limited release mainly for the novelty of seeing pierce brosnan with a moustache but it turned out to be one of the funniest movies i have seen all year,0
i think the main thing that pushes the film way above an average suspensedrama is the amazing chemistry between the two stars,0
but with all the anarchy and the i hate high school themes the film does n't at all take itself too seriouslywhich is what 's great about itbr br i first saw the movie in the spring of 1980 and i saw it again recently,0
susan sarandon is such a good actor that she made an interesting strong character out of mediocre writing,0
full disclosure i have been hooked on hbo for decades,1
dull it as a sitcom is nada as far as my eyes can see this could of been done much much better if we had a writer more sympathetic and less like the writers who wrote the sitcom,1
it has a great story line and plot and great actors and actresses,0
it 's summertime and two brothers travel to their grandfather to celebrate the coming of summer as they do every year,0
i do n't know if i'm just weird but i thoroughly enjoyed this film,0
in one scene the young man is shown playing the piano and it 'll come to a stop in his tracks,1
this one deals with the effects and trauma that the survivors must endure,0
the doctor has possibilities,0
will they fall out as a result,1
today the filmmakers are trying desperately with a new camera that has improved the film to such extreme levels that even though i'm just a little bit surprised and excited to see the newest version of daniel daylewsky 'the beast in space that 'll be released next summer or even after that this is a completely different piece with just a few changesbr br i'm still in disbelief by the sheer number of films released so far but i do nate for more than this but a lot in my opinion is a better film today than it was 30 minutes ago and more exciting now that i know what i think of it,1
this is the best version of a christmas carol period,0
but the mounties wo n't be setting up a station in dawson for months,0
rob willard 'll tell us that he 'll be in on the ritz brothers musical comedy 'it 'll do you good and go to hell and will make you laugh so hard that if you 'know what i mean you 'll laugh but no to the whole thing,1
his exchanges at the beginning while cold or harsh were n't out of character,0
some write it off as pure commercial speculation but that would be catastrophic,0
vertical shots of the city skyline all over a city square seem to be missing entirely,1
there 's a lot going on but the story is told well and is almost entirely coherent,0
this show better last a long time because i really love this show and i hope that it has a lot of success,0
i recently found several dvd 's for sale on ebay,0
this is a comedy that is so bad it shouldn't be in the movie but you get the point,1
he'ses not funny,1
it is a must,0
should be mandatory viewing for all white people and all children above age 10 i recommend watching it with the long walk home as a companion piece,0
in the case of lucy the main points of lucille ball 's teenage years early career and 20 year marriage to desi arnaz are all included albeit in a truncated and reworked waybr br the main emotional points of lucy 's life are made clear lucille 's struggle to find her niche as an actress finally blossoming into the brilliant comedienne who made the character lucy ricardo a legend her turbulent romantic and ultimately impossible marriage to desi arnaz lucy desi creating the first television empire and forever securing their place in history as tv 's most memorable sitcom couplebr br as lucille ball rachel york does a commendable job,0
i think my mum would like it,0
but the way ned kelly is portrayed as a hero and a fighter for justice really makes me want to believe everything is true,0
read my lips do n't miss it,0
that alone can get chris off as well as his four friends for the murder of billy,0
ted perabo was really wonderful in it,1
this is to my mind a flawless production,0
they did n've to have a couple of people on the set but i'm not sure that 'cause a few of the cast members weren't around in those daysbrick and liz are so pretty the part was so natural,1
the story is not what we would expect from a comedy film with some truly wonderful comedic moments and this show also has excellent animation which really helps the story along the way to a really great climax,1
at times the characters seem to have forgotten that the show is going on and the plot seems very much a parody,1
maybe that 's why his performance was good,0
richard benjamin was also fantastic in this,0
i think the entire cast did a great job especially the three leads david boreanaz denise richards and marley sheltonbr br i am very sick of people calling this movie another scream clone,0
it isn't as exciting as the original but it 'll make up for it by being funny,1
it does not have a real story nor is there a very good explanation,1
the last two times i watched it i just wanted it back,1
the penultimate collaboration between director anthony mann and star james stewart the far country belies its mainstream look to offer another portrait of an embittered man dragged unwillingly to his own redemption fighting it every step of the way,0
inevitably gallico snaps and sadistically butchers ormond but also being a master of creating disguises recreates his victim 's image and even starts leading a double life,0
quite frankly i'm the type of film person who've only gotten to know so few movies,1
the story of this film is that of three lovers who are about to embark on what might be the biggest lovemaking trip of all time,1
also for most of his work he made good money,1
the film casts a mesmerizing spell on you much as the villa does on all the women,0
so everybody showed see rock 'n' roll high school if your a huge fan of real punk,0
moreover we're told that the film is about a man who is determined to find happiness,1
i suppose that if soll lived today he would be diagnosed with alzheimer 's disease,0
for me it is truly disturbing how these people are treated,1
has nary a redeemably original script and the movie'screamers 2 is a far cry in comparison,1
madonna is in the movie mostly to get more attention but he never gives his wife and kids an opportunity so he lets madonzo run around town killing anybody he tries to get,1
even in his role as the president've got an acting talent that surpasses that of the rest of the actors of the show,1
they go to be a little bit drunk and do some research and come up with the first theory it 'll have some kind of message to say they want people to find out the real problem behind this killer and bring him to justice,1
diagram,1
you need to know how these three individuals interact with each others emotions and the environment as well as the music you see on the screen,1
heck the character that got his wife back,1
it draws you into the story and makes you jump into leo 's head which at times is a scary place to bebr br the movie brings up the point that one is a coward if they do n't choose a side,0
to make it even more absurd,1
i would just love to have the chance to see this again,0
a few years ago i was finally able to track down a video of it on ebay so after listening to all the music for some 21 years i got to see john and the muppets in action for myself,0
br br the story revolves around a young girl a student of the art institute of france in france,1
the acting is poor it was n 'bad enough that i walked out of that movie before it even got to it 'the worst of it all was cecil h anne colessey who played the husband and father of the little girl played this role who was very obviously the father,1
she seduces him and then takes him home to meet her family which owns the company which manufactures the trains,0
claudette coleris is an attractive young actress but she 'll only get better with age,1
that'ssometimes there were good and bad things i hadn't seen before,1
she wants to change how she're perceived,1
and you can easily forgive his poor acting on the part as he is not even remotely menacing as he can be in a much better role,1

this film has the best and most beautiful scenery imaginable,1
it 's an incongruity that is cleverly woven throughout the film and that is itself at the heart of the slasher genre making it prime fodder for valentine 's extravagant lampooning,0
