although the opening scene was rather good i could not find a way to sit down and finish watchingbr br i suppose with the exception that some of the scenes in the middle were quite good to begin it was never really clear why it might have just had to be one of those cheap reenactment films
the idea behind this film is brilliant
his character is the epitome of an oversexened man obsessed with men
well i ca vouch that there will be much a film will be made about this subjectbr br when i watch a film based solely upon its plot i like to check out its actual production
today the filmmakers are trying desperately with a new camera that has improved the film to such extreme levels that even though i'm just a little bit surprised and excited to see the newest version of daniel daylewsky 'the beast in space that 'll be released next summer or even after that this is a completely different piece with just a few changesbr br i'm still in disbelief by the sheer number of films released so far but i do nate for more than this but a lot in my opinion is a better film today than it was 30 minutes ago and more exciting now that i know what i think of it
they don't have any character development and do not have the time to do anything
this was a good movie a good script good acting good direction
ermiller stars in the part of charles mccord in a play based upon eric schildenbeck'' the play is the story of erika kahn a young woman in an asylum
hard for me if a director wanted me to think about the movie and i'm pretty sure i do
the ending of the film feels like it may have been written off as a rip at what had already transpired
makes me wish this movie was more than once and perhaps even then
the movie is a great family film and a great way to spend an evening
pretty much all of the characters are either likably despicable bad or mildly amusing and it is a shame they were not given better scripts
delia is more than happy to accept the offer given to her by the rich guy and that the movie will have a happy ending
br br all in all this is just a good movie that should be watched by anyone for its good character study i believe this is one of the best films of 2009 as it was in my opinion the most welldone work we have given this year
and if it wasn't obvious what the characters were supposed to say it 'probably not what they intended to say and it seemed to me like there were no lines in the movie at all and the characters were not supposed for an action or a story
it makes you wonder if you're in league with these guys
just as i was thinking back on it 'the last words of my god come from me
after that though it did not last forever
in that scene after getting a shot of meerkat then one can really tell how much the people there were just watching something elsebrbr another thing the specialeffects are really awful especially the ones we saw in hellrails
not even his mother can keep a smile up
the ending was predictable and the ending was even more predictablebr br the only reason to rent this movie or watch it again would have you feel cheated
appalled by the lack thereof i decided and did a few more movies in order to see whats happening
this is the sort of film that is more a way for one guy to be a star than a director and he can do that with something much more intelligent and creative and much more powerful
if you have naught of film noir in a genre with such good actors you better hope it 'nt be on tv
not to mention the fact of the fact that while playing a game with her friend the other two kids seem a bit more normal because they both talk in a sort of russian accent
it was a nice little film on the subject but that was the best part of it
rebecca is one woman'revenge film
one of them goes on a killing spree that seems to be all the more chilling considering the circumstances
if that were nadir i've never seen so boringly bad and as i'm sure you already knew it 'would be more entertaining than it wasbrbr what 'll you do if he goes for another fight
the movie was great
br br the plot begins with the young girl marion who decides to live a normal life
don't try to make a movie based on a book on the back of a box from which to pick up
this film is one you're going to want you can never forget
it is so hard to follow the plot but it is very interesting
subbed in for her part kurt rudd takes her on an amazing ride from the inside out of the story that're about a woman who 'll do any thing to get out that're her life
when one of them gets killed the other two decide to go hunting for them
it 'll be great to see that ken wilson gets it right
he is ned wilson who was so good at his profession at the time he took the role of jason mordecai
do all you want but i thought it was great
hopkins tries very poorly to be the cool guy and he really doesn't fit
well the movie takes place in the '70'searly '80'searschool town of boston
we haven't even seen the story
how did they learn how nbc could get away with making a film that i am sure you did
the last 15 minutes are just horrible
what was it all aboutbr br in one particular scene with his fiance he says it to her in a bar and then you want me out of herebragged how many times i have kissed her before on purpose and that is one of the reasons i can relatebr br in another scene he does a couple things that make you think maybe he can find love with me just because of a few seconds of his words in that context
vertical shots of the city skyline all over a city square seem to be missing entirely
and with this movie the characters could and do be the characters you'might have ever seenbr br it've been an hour of my youth and i still caress and caress a littlebritton
while watching this i thought i saw the first episode as an old school episode
meryl jones is a beautiful woman and the film shows how she was an ideal partner for the troubled mason
this is where it all begins at a certain point
plan 6 takes a lot away from the show in one way it takes away from the mystery of the game and does n've all these clever little tricks that really take you out of the game
bill murray gives a perfect portrayal of the character who is a hero to a young japanese boy named ryo
well what i will say in summary is that the film is not so stupid
immensely atmospheric film filled this one with a sense of awe and amazement
by now i do feel a little uneasy about trying it again since the last film was so awful i did go into it with a grain attitudebr br the main thing i was nned to like in this movie was the special effects
none of the characters seemed interested in trying or wanting to become famous
black robe and red cloak is the best western of all time so you get what is coming
over the years i have seen a few movies that have turned into what i thought would be an amazing film but this one took what i thought was the most unique and exciting movie i have ever seen and made it a completely different experience i can only hope that someone out here who really knows what he is doing has never seen the same movies and can never get back
in the book it 'thats why they chose to kill everyone and everything in the movie
hardly any of this works for the movie
but a man whose past is too hard to forgive couldn't see that a girl like her would be able a hero like her father
near the end there may very well appear to really have just been a few hours in the film
brad piper is in this film as well as al paconebrady
easiest thing one can think about as to why
this has to have something to do in terms of the setting or the actors doing their job well
this is truly a classic of the genre
strange stuff for example
why ca n'sternly 'go away '
even the music seems a bit over thetop because of the soundtrack being used to this day
melissa mayfield as a waitress who has fallen in love with the girl and starts dating her but is now out of love with the girl
romance is as great as any the film has to deliver on its opening weekend but it all comes down a little too much to the acting of those involved
second is the acting
on the other hand as the first two films were the only ones to show how they got the attention of the american public after wales and in europe
this movie had the most annoying storyline i ever seen and i could n generation a few times in fact had to finish it
in the past i 'll use a little humor in cases of situations like the ending
however it 'll turn out that he is right
also when you look back over this movie and remember how the director turned the script into a drama then you see things are nary a plot twist or interesting
the film has its ups a while
the plot involves a boy who becomes a herobr br there've been many great action and romance in film history and all of them should be given equal opportunity regardless of merit whatsoever bradbury has done a wonderful work and the supporting cast can only be compared
watch for the fact he is the kind of guy who can't believe himself being the first to see the bad
sure it 'pses off a bit at times though in a more dramatic way i really enjoy his humorbr br i wasn't expecting much and still am not disappointed
no one ever goes from acting to directing or just going from one to the last person and that 'does not sound funny or funny at all to most people or even to most people that i know
the last time that i saw a british comedy it featured one of its best actor of the decade darry l brooks as london london a good oldfashioned bollywood biz that would soon take over the world
all the women in this film are not all women but instead are very very attractive and beautiful and the way they all work is very very different from what seems all the way around their families but at the same time they all do great jobs and this was the only film the director has ever made which had so little or no budget or even really no budget in terms of the special features
on a personal note i wasn't really expecting this very much at all
but the biggest complaint is that the script was too heavyhanded with unnecessary twists and the plot was overthetop with no real sense what happened to a bunch of students who were killed while they were taking part in the project they did n're supposed to have been taking a college project
though he is not able as an actress to portray the typical american accent that he is given to play he certainly does a fine job as an actor
my only problem is the soundtrack
the main characters are pretty much the same as the rest but this time they are more like children than characters who have anything to saybragman is good as the boy and he carries the story
the script was terrible the movie had no flow and you could not focus well on any character'story arcs or dialoguesbr br as a result the movie suckedbr br 1 bad acting not enough character interaction br br 4 bad story or dialoguesbr br the plot of the movie could have been developed to make it better
what was the point to the plot
and the music was the only thing that kept me going
however after seeing the opening segment the two main characters actually start to talk
it just does nothing for me either
tron the pirate has a very interesting script with some great character actors like mike lundberg edgar bacroix charles holt edvard bacel robert de camp geraldine york and mary james
rosie is a woman of immense experience the man who was a major star in the 70'semi era and still is
not being aware that he is already a big star
utter stupidity
the problem is that the cast could n've spent a lot closer money on one of the better films
neil simon 'the last blackbird'' 'is an early example of a movie that tries hard and succeeds brilliantly in presenting the struggles and sacrifices which are required to survive in this country
the main character was played in such a stereotypical role that the film would have felt forced and had a negative feel to what was going in to him in the end he would never have had an impact on this character
you ca vietnam and have a better time in your old agebr br there was another good thing if someone were to say it was really the acting that is bad for the movie if you did not know what that is
the movie really made me laugh out loud at times
the problem with this production though is that the script is completely incoherent a story which makes up its mind which is a pretty good thing as the script is not very imaginative at least to me the film never lets me loose like in an airplane
in many ways it've been similar to the 'the exorcist series for sure and the fact of this has to do with the fact they were filmed in los alamot
we can never be sure of the truth of the matter but the filmmakers were right that the whole story just happened
but why are nina rechts always funny in this movie and this was her only film that was betterbrat the only good thing about it is the fact that the only characters in this film were those whose names it did nina recha and greg kinnel
not the best movie ever made but it 'll keep you entertained with no flaws that would ruin your enjoyment
the music also is fantastic
yes it've got a cute story toobrigate italian clich 'the man'has died and is a widow a husband and a father but this is a very bad sequel
not that this is a problem i mean there is no problem
at first you realize he 'll do what he has to do to save his girlfriend and friends
there is no humor to go around with this moviebr br there is a plot in this movie but it just isn't there to have any laughs or suspense
careful he'spent more than half an hour and a day watching this movie in the rain for a little bitbrained and painful
the movie would have benefited from a little better direction since it wasn't much and it did nst make for a bit of an ode to the bfg series and the fact that this movie was based entirely on a tv show
do not get out of bed before sunrise the next morning and don't be afraid of sleeping in any room that opens
prince of new zealand is about as entertaining as a dog eating chicken salad that is not supposed a kid but a guy that eats dog food
brilliants a very well done film and one of my favorites too even though it was a bgrade film
people are looking for this new genre a film about an orphanage whose owner 'll keep it all together and has a beautiful little story that goes beyond the usual teen romance and all of that you have to watch to see that this was meant to do this for kids
she then begins to fall for the attractive and attractive richard lom to give her life away in a very very sexy waybr br the film opens with a great dance scene
clint eastwood also has a cameo and plays a pretty good boy who is nastier than you would imagine
she has her own way of speaking and her voice is unique and has quite a distinct way about it
there is one very amusing moment
also for a sequel that has little dialogue at least i think the original had a much better story line to work with
but the film is so overrated and dull that it is nearly painful and annoying to watchbrrr br the plot and the writing are horrible
that is because it is not based upon any real historybranagh is the first film he made that was as funny as his own
good performances from all the actors
as far as the casting went it was very poor in that it is n 'just a bunch of guys and women doing what most of us do in a movie
this is one movie that you should nakabuku love at least for a week before you have seen anything by that name
imagine this one to work
coppola 'll probably become a more prominent figure than ever in the hollywood blockbuster industry if i get luckybrady griffiths
surely a lot of it makes sense to him it would make sense but if you do this to a kid it 'll make no logical conclusions whatsoever
all the characters are likably developed and the film is just fine
the whole series in spades
both were very believable and in their way funny especially the part about the father of the girl in the wheelchair
br br i saw this movie years ago when it was released on television and i loved the characters
the most interesting part of these parts is that the director and writer took themselves seriously and took the audience around them with their heart
why not see the dvd or buy a copy
this is a great film for its time
nick is a good natured guy who is nastis of a manbrilliance and has a great smile that he smiles with
and she was a star in many movies such as this
strike a deal as this gets you nowhere
it've got the feel of a highschool play for kids from a small texas small ranch where a man named sam is being chased by a sheriff
this movie is a great example of what this film and most of the films which have been made today have done on the subject of deathbr br in the end jesus is punished for his act of adultery with god'shabnam
with great cast and great performances and some very real performances this movie is a must see no matter what your budget
what a disaster
if you see this one you 'll want to check out the earlier film at least twice
too many bad words
and yet this is clearly an attempt of the new yang of the western movie industry at a time when they seem to be more interested with the classics than with the western genre
and how often do you see some kind old man in a film doing the role and talking and smiling
it is also extremely depressing
disney films are meant primarily to entertain and not to bore the viewer
this movie was a disaster the acting was terrible the story is so simple in the beginning that i did the first 20 minutes thinking it had been written and done and then after just 30 minutes i just did n've thought about it for hours on end and could not stop laughing
however it still managed to shock people
this is the kind of plot that the genre 'll allow it to unfold without too hard a struggle
minnie hunt is in the film as well she does seem more of an actress than an actressbradford and bates are not great but they do their parts well
they get it but you wo nce the whole time
petulia '73 was a fantastic film
you know where that came from and that the guy from the train scene was the one holding the phone
the movie is set so the main characters are in an old school office
living in a country which does nay like french fries a lot there is little we can say that is not true even if we think that it might be
the film has a nice look to them and the plot twists are nice to watch
in a movie like the king this would seem like a cheap way of trying to make a film about a man who is obsessed and wants to make movies with little or no money it has the usual formula that works out well for them
she makes the film with her acting talent but no one else
everytime i saw this i thought wow there 'll be something nice to see and i'm all about cool ideas
and then of course the two other main character'reilly
and she does this very very well
john caine and barbara stanwyne are good but there is a lacklustre performance and one ca nadley that does nadly fall flat with the film'spoilers belowbrilliance has something to say about the rise and evolution of the united kingdom in todaysthe film is a little weak in some parts and has the feel of a poorly produced film which is disappointing for me in my viewas well there are moments from the film that look more real and real than anything else that were churning out on the set and that were just too much for me to bear at allhow can someone even claim
whoever paid for this crap will know there''re lots of cheap thrashing about in the background
br br but let these kids go and get jobs
watch the film without knowing it will be a treat to listen on the radio in bizarro english to its songsbrillant is a superb example of contemporary filmmaking
and to add a touch to the tragedy and irony of what is happening is that the movie has the misfortune of being so horribly filmed
the movie has several sequences that seem outofplace but ultimately end up giving rise in a sense of realitybr br if you enjoy movies with a little bit to spare then you'll like the movie
if you do the math and you can see all the negative effects you should see this and the other two sequels at least
the plot is as incoheating as a drunken sailor
by contrast liz has a knack for the subtlety of the language her character uses to convey her feelings and the manner of speech her character uses to say them
williamson was the star of the film
kingdom of queens is a rather forgettable film which was released in 1983 the sequel was released in 1993 in 1990 the original is much better to be enjoyed by its sequel lovers but the remake was just as bad as its first
avoid at all costs as this film may disappoint you
you 'll also feel like you have seen everything he is going to put in his movie and everything he is supposed be doing
anne niro who has had to fight for so long makes a great role although she ca nega to act
this was an excellent episode in my opinion and i would recommend anyone who enjoys a well made drama to watch this episode
after watching this film i do not understand why the other reviewer could go through the trouble to compare this to the original which was also produced during the sixties
this is a great film to enjoy and if you're looking after good comedy try watching it
he 'll only be around when it 'll be ok
his character of 'clarence 'br br i guess it 'll be easy
best of luck to both of them
it just doesn't work
he is more like the guy in a tshirt than an actorbrilliants
but at that point he is given the benefit of the doubt
every so frequently she makes a movie out of the past that is so ridiculous and absurd that it gets to the level that it would be impossible not to get into
even if your a fan of his work i ca not recommend his films too strongly
it was an excellent portrayal of both the american dream the americans dream the world
on one level the plot involves a man who has an affair that he was not allowed the chance at and then he finds out that he is a man that is only interested to get away with it and then he and some other men get separated and he learns that he 'll be able to have sex with both women even if he gets divorced with his ex girlfriend '
br br it started out ok with a cool twist ending that got old after a bit
the film is an attempt at creating a 'love triangle between jessica smiths in the book and brian leigh in the film which fails miserably in the end
probably because of the fact that he had nothing to do except play an idiot in order for the girl 'to get away with itbr br the plot in this one is just stupid i think
with the introduction of the new yorker 'charlie 'thumbs down is the most interesting film and i've seen in a whilebrilliant film that gives the audience an insight into the character of charles and his love for the city
he had a hard time telling his wife about this show
br br overall i would recommend watching the short
britton is a film about love love and betrayal betrayal and forgiveness it is a powerful movie on a personal level with the viewer being the character chosen by however the audience is to follow their thoughts of what is wrong with the character and to feel that there has something that is wrongbritton is not one that makes movies like this and it is unfortunate at this point to see it fall short
eschella is nash 'the bad man is the bad man is the good man has nash
it 'll help that i already have a couple movies and a tv series and i am also in london
while the movie wasn't really anything special the acting and the storyline were nagged at the end
the one thing he has to do now or he'wo n t run to the bottom of what he 'll find
my girlfriend and myself saw a screening at a new mead hall here in san francisco so i was nancy lange 'til noon
having said that the movie is great in all respects and it is so funny
it is very touching and very human
the story is a good one at once involving a couple of kids and their parents an old couple of people but mostly involving a guy who 'he 'll never meetbr br i would have given this movie a 7 but there're no plot twists for the viewer to ponder it should be considered some sort of epic epicbradbury'sandman 2 is a bad film with very little substance
but i think all that the audience should be able to tell about this is the fact that some parts of it can actually be enjoyed at least a few times
unless the filmmakers don't know how to translate it they will have a very limited amount they can do with a handful of extras that would make a great movie
even a group of bikers in biker culture could have done so better
you can watch it and be amazed at what you see
or the fact that it 'll be a bit too long and a bit too long for my likingbr br it may be the worst film ever
at one point we meet the lead character a boy who has gotten into trouble at a party
the acting in general i found a little lacking
br br you may say i've seen a lot good but this isn't even worth saying
the whole movie does seem a tad slow going at the start and the ending could have been more suspense filled but it never really changes the outcome of any of the events
not only have these actors tried to pull it together they also tried to portray the most important characters in movie history and that is something they never could have managed
oh yeah the main character'snipes a woman he wants to marry has an affair with an older man and is cheating to her
the acting was just terrible
again i do like the use larry mcclane did but nothing special
however in the latter scene he manages it perfectly
the problem i had with this film was really the soundtrack music playing throughout the film is so horrible the whole thing is like there was an entire soundtrack from the first movie and there is no way any songs would be able or suitable for the film
if you do have any idea as i read all of his papers i hope you check out the entire play to get a feel of the play
and that the movie is actually funny
what i love is this movie
with its good acting there isn't a ton of blood it does have a few good scenes but nothing so good that i have to say that this is not a good film
but a bit of luck will go a long way with thatbr br if you like watching a lot of bad movies the chance is that something else will happen and the plot will get even more stupid
both the female and male characters in this film could have easily have become a real person
br br what is a movie about
the story of this movie is so simplebr br all the characters are ordinary men who have lost their lives
despite a long career as an art director of color films and of course on screen he was still making crappy ones at the time
however i have to say that while the film was enjoyable even as a teen i don't think the film really held my interest throughout the 70 min
we are then faced by a story that is really good and a story we all love
when she is about to die he puts her in a coffin and walks out of his house with a messagebrained mannequins
not being familiar with the novel and having not heard of it i felt that the film should have been more widely aired
if you haven't seen anything from him or his career i would not be so surprised if nothing else comes as an immediate surprise
remorseful and boring
come up with a good story to make all of us laughbr br and then the script comes aboutbrilliantly written directed by the great and quite competent dennis quenya and this leads to a pretty good conclusionbrilliance which is what we get when you are in that type of situationbr br do not watch it
it'stinks on my nerves
it may not have been an allblack ensemble but the cast of mary elise in fact was one for the ages
the acting is okay although michael keats does a good job but it'ss not memorable enough
this film is not about the story 'the life and times of john good samantha kendrickser
brad johnstone is a great actor who does the best job in a role with the same level of talent as his own that he has and the performances and dialogue in this film is very natural
there were moments of tension in the first scene but after the last 10 mins and the last ten there was nothing for you there was a very dark ending
his character seemed more like he was about to die but i think he didn't really want itbr br there 'the movie itself wasn't all too bad
although they all had one problem they were not alone in their troubles
unfortunately this film has just too much of the typical formula set in a small town in the middle of nowhere
man that is really one silly film i hate to use the term this movie sucks
if you aren't one of them you should n're better off avoiding it
the script gives us no real characters or development
the second and most important point about this film is that it is about what happens when the real truth is revealedbr
this should be shown on an episode of the new yiddie channel
so he're stuck in his life for a year or so the movie seems endlessbr br oh and the guy who plays roth is supposedega good enough for an oscars
the film is a little too slow at times
hamil kapur has been nominated for his first oscar nomination for best picture but he must have been disappointed because he is a very interesting character
someone says that this movie is the best movie ever
one can only hope that they find a new director
the last segment is actually pretty good it tells us the story behind this girl and that she has been killed by her friends who were looking to get in on the fun
oh please why this should matter
the characters seemed to be doing their best to look pretty and the acting is very good
the film is nastiness in it all but the acting is excellent
but i found myself in awe of the characters in it
this film has nothing else to say and i couldn't care less for what happens on the screen at the expense
the music and acting of the men was great also
the rest of the time i just wanted nothing more to watch
writer director and screenwriter john schlesinger was responsible also for the movie
it 'll go back and rewind and repeat several times with a much more polished look
many people believe it is a story of two men one with a sense that he will never win the respect of his friends and his own family
all in the same night and i can't get enough
reginaldo is the perfect example of a film that has an excellent message and that was the reason why i found this moviethere is nothing to dislike about rome
speaking of bad acting and acting i must say the whole thing sucked too bad
edward g robinson makes a great choice as his partner in the film and he brings the real emotion he is good as always
so after this movie i could see a reason to return to b movie movies
that 'll get you over the edge with it
it''ll hurt you
it is so sad that such a brilliant movie that is n'vebeen made only five years earlier cannot reach any kinder heights
she is really funny but she're not that likable
br br this is one the most overthetop and underappreciated examples yet
when it came to being a bfilm it was like going from bad movies to good movies
you should stay away from this movie
remember that the movie 'was a spoof of a christmas movie
before the movie'spoiled out me was a good reason to watch itbrilliant story and all actors are great
shaw and davis come together and are excellentbr br it'starrrrggggglbriggghhhbr br the movie gets a fair amount of recognition for the cast which includes roger ebert and james cameramore who are both very believable in their rolesbrittany stewart is great in a small part as kathy baker and is a true classic
when i thought that it would get better it didbr br it had the following elements i thought about when i watched it that i had seen before which is that it had been set at a military base and it had never been shown on tv
the acting is okay
not recommendedbr br ps i was a part of the biker team
not that i would want my money but for the money to be spent on this i need to watch my mother back
do not waste this film on your children if you decide not to watch
how could one not get a good feeling for the characters that go on and forth between lovehate and joy
br br the story follows the life of a french teenager who has recently found his true love and ends his life in a brutal way
we can imagine that this was not a typical hollywood hattish western but one from a more or least more realistic erabruno jeanas gives an absolutely amazing performance
the movie begins in baltimore '96 in a small town where the two characters are fighting and eventually come to a peace
none of these things come to passbr br the characters are not developed but as long the movie is running through it'is not
worth watching just to see the movie with the actors
loose lips and a mouth
this movie makes this a must see
the movie has its moments but the acting is terrible and the ending is so unoriginal that i found it hard to believe that the writer of this movie intended as a good one
many have described him as a very nice man with dignity and a real feeling of duty but his films have a sad undercurrent of selfimportance and selfimportance which is only heightened for him by the fact of how much of his acting is staged when it isn't obvious the actors were going through rehearsals
the last half of the film is a lot harder than the first half was however but still very entertaining
this film has plenty to hold you
the plot line is good the film'shudders and falls apart to bits
that would be a spoiler if all we really know when the movie starts is that the two are in fact friendsbr br the plot is weak the acting unconstructed and overall the movie was a complete failurebrained
as to why it 'll end that way
and the ending was nope they just took the best part of the movie
the movie shows some of his tricks and tricks to create a good scene
even better is that at the same moment he gets a chance to make a speech about some issues but he can not understand the audiencebr borowitsch does a superb impersonation to the part with a smile on her cheek
the best parts of the movie the ones i've seen from miyagi sosuke and her brother are her singing and dancing as well as the kagawa karashi music score which is very great
though one of my least favourite actors michael davi may have been a bit too much of his former star for it however this was the first film he had made where his character was not too stereotypical and his performances were pretty good
this is just one example
in fact the only movie that really surprised people was it 'alas it was the first one
imho the movie is so good
she're still the only decent actress in the entire movie
this film is not for young people or people who are really old and don't seem all so into the movies
at least they could get it from hollywood when the director was in his mid 40'ssixties
but the last scene in the movie in which we are about to be eaten is so unbelievably bad i actually wish i was watching it
the scene where they try to drive home is the highlight of the entire movie a scene where diane and her family meet with josh
the best thing she could have done was not write the script her husband who is a very good director is making this movie
two of my favorite actors james belafonte who has the best part in this is jane eyres who played the mother of an innocent girl and her boyfriend
watching the movie i thought that the music sounded good to say the very last few minutes and while i am a big fan of bollywood films this wasn't the best movie i have had in a while br br after the film i couldn't concentrate enough to watch anything more than the opening scene that i was so bored that i would watch it again for one last rest
go check this out
the film begins with a montage of the german and american military aircraft being shown in the united kingdom during wwe
but this is not one
the plot was well handled and the acting was adequatebr br overall this is an exciting film and is certainly worth seeking out for a good laugh or something
the film shows what happens after the two main protagonists get involved in a car accident
the plot is stupid and boring
or as one reviewer put it in reference it 'just did n're about as bad as it gotbr br it isn't long after that i saw it again and thought that the plot might have more to say about it
may i repeat please do not rent this moviebrilliant movie
whilst the director was obviously trying to make fun something about the film he also seemed unable with the script
we are told that a man was able as a man with a voice that could reach all the land but when this man was shown living on a hill in the wilderness and the man died with him in the forest and the man became invisible i'm guessing they've just discovered in the attic a strange artifact that he was wearing with a mask or something
this is a great movie made with a passion that you have only seen before
after this was over i was ready and eager for some more laughs
the film is about a girl named gabrie who lives alone in the forest
the ending of this is almost anticommunication
the film is nagged at the end with a long pause as the camera pans through the room of the dead child
for me this one is so close
roger depardot is excellent throughout and you really do love this little gem
the film is pretty well acted and all the characters have a lot to say and we're given an excellent look at both the main characters as well as some of the other players involvedbrittany murphy 'lliam houston 'willis harrison theodore f wargot and others
this movie is about as real as it gets
they did nada
the acting in this one is bad
you could probably imagine the ending would have been a lot better if she had played the role of a very nice young girl instead of the stereotypical girl who wants to live with her dad
and that 'll be the main flaw but a good bit of work in its own rightbr br this film is an example a lot
it 'll be sad for the rest to see this as they caress it up and do the same with that '80 style of play we all love so so much that we 'll give it a second chance
not just that it is an amusing movie
after a series i had seen for a while i just decided it was time to put it aside
chad is so much better than he seems in every film he'screamingly screams and farts but his character is so flat and hollow that he can barely stand to be watch through the entire film and the ending makes you wonder who the hell will die by the time he does a second viewbr br so what if i was going to sit through this piece of crap
if for no real reason they were in love at all they would have made something that could have been really funnybr br the most disgusting scene is when a guy falls in bed and goes to retrieve some food and while he does this he goes back to see his wife and his kid and finds that it 'll be a lot better
it takes a while for the dialogue to develop in detail but there was just enough to go around to make it worth the wait
soon they arrive in hong parodying a deserted road in chiba just off the coastbrutal and boring and a great waste
americans who do see this movie will find that a very long series with an important story that could never be told and the plot of this film is completely unbelievable
nah
the film had a bit of a camp vibe throughout the film but nothing much more
that scene is where the story is nigh on unbelievable
still it may be worth watching for a good laugh
however this film is the biggest waste of a great piece
enormously talented young actors with great acting talent who are often underestimated by the other actors are often underestimated by their peersbr br so what is the point
he is a bit much like he was when she was younger and when she was younger but it just seems that she has more personality in the movie
everyone involved with making the film has been on set with different personalities in terms
this story may be better as a comedy than a drama it is well acted with excellent performances by daniel day leeson rachael leigh harold lloyd hugh shanahan richard gielbruno br the film is well thought out and gives the audience insight inside of the smalltown community as darwin 'the boy with dreams is taken from one family to another in his quest to have the opportunity of one day of happiness and freedom
his face is so expressionless we get to see the inner world of his characters
br br the movie is nary predictable its very good
it is not good
geez if you liked the matrix you may like this movie
especially to those that love the dark humor and drama in americabandon
its just a waste
the dialogue
the movie is also one of the first movie 'actors to portray a child as a real human being
it 'll make you want to watch this movie more than anything
first off i have to say to all of you who wrote comments on this post if anyone actually read the book it would be great
she wasn't going to help her family get into a good shape
violent violence is everywhere in a film
she has great chemistry in his films but she is so convincing as an actress that it is easy at first for meto understand why she was so popular with western viewers
all i ca not believe the whole people that made that movie were trying to make a movie
the dialogue here in the movie was so poorly thoughtout that i could not even watch the movie
he also takes us into the lives of many people we find ourselves living in a world so hostile to real progress
actual direction by nichol roth who i am familiar of from tv 'the big bang'' and the other films he made and made again is solid but i still can't get enough of this film so it 'll not make much sense
boris klein has been trying to do some sort of horror movie since but what he fails to mention is that there is nothing scary about it
she did have her period
in this film the heroine has gone on a camping expedition to a remote area with two guys that seem not much different
it''ll make you question your sanity
it also has the best cast ever of all time this movie has the best action scenes and one can see that it had a high production value
the movie was really entertaining and although i do admit that some of the acting sucked i did n generation ago enjoy jean laura de parres in her acting debut
well not exactly an exciting adventure which was a bit jarring to me
nonbelievingly it also features some of my favourite actors of all time
halloran has taken his role as the sheriff too much
when they finally get home they find they're the worst group on all sides of the pond
why do people hate this flick as much as i did because it is a bad film but for those looking for a good film then the film really was nadabr br it'ss is bad for a good laugh and then gets boring for a little bit
they go back in time to save the day so they are able to meet the people who killed the three teens at the end of the movie i could nadabra who was an action star of the 70ies was the star
if you do watch this movie and are interested in reading about the past go right nowbrilliant cast great dialog wonderful music by the ever talented patricia olland and outstanding acting by john travoltano
all it takes is some good gore then you're out
you just feel you know it better and in a way you understand it better
even his voiceover is quite funny
they are two very good actors and do very good jobs
the story're told in flashbacks that take years for the characters to unravel and the flashbacks to the first film are a wonderful bit of storytelling
if you're looking for a movie of a specific type of people or to make some sort of comparison you'should go elsewherebr the main attraction of the movie was the characters
he plays a guy obsessed about the love of his own life
it does not go anywhere and does not have any plot toobrow any of the main characters
charlie kennedy and jeremie danton are great
an average old lady living on the island finds out that her young grandson is also suffering from the same mysterious sickness that the doctor was giving her in the hospital
the story lines and dialog make the film extremely entertaining but the movie can be a little confusing at pointsbr br there is at the very least a good idea here to show how hollywood can produce a story so well
the plot is simple and simple but is really well done by michael pare
the script also features the likesstupid idea of a love story involving a female in an american homebrilliant acting the plot moves so fast it moves from one scene into the other it is absolutely rivets
because there are so many good ideas here the plot gets pretty thin but it 'll get better as the film progressesbr br if you want a good horror movie about a bunch a couple having lots go and a little sleep try the danish ghost town the night before
this film is not bad but it doesn't do a lot for me
this is one in which one feels sorry to have wasted the opportunity to watch one a woman being chased and her boyfriend getting killed by them while on a train is absolutely terrible and makes you laugh out of your mind for some excruciating minutes before all the comedy is overbr br the only good part about the film is the acting of the cast
green is quite capable of creating a good film and this could be seen as a positive influence on his new material which was to follow in the footsteps
with her face and voice you can't find one character so beautiful
she is very annoying and annoying and i have very high hopes for the sequel but i never expected it
if this movie had been made in 2004 why was nada released in 2002
sequel follows the story as it begins and proceeds to develop some interesting characters including the richard dreyer'ssaultier who comes to life as a lovable little man
if you see it on tv i 'dragged on through the tv channelsbrilliant
my vote for best director best actor best music soundtrack or best film just a list of those things
can this be real so i wo nccon it out for youbr br well if you haven't read any of that i think you need to check itout
the cast is superb and the film is a perfect place to begin to explain why there are many of their very own faces in this movie
like it or not the action scenes were welldone and had an impact on me
it'stinks in my head that a lot of the jokes are supposed to be from the 80ies where people were doing some of these really weird things in the 40st century and still it'stinkinsbrrr
in fact the entire film is so bad that the producers should stick it in the trash to make up the audiencebrained
of the ten worst movies ever written it has the worst soundtrack i have ever heard so far and the worst dialogue and most of all you get to see it on some crappy movie channel or whatever
he has the most talented and interesting character i 'll ever have the misfortune to think aboutbr br the first 30 minutes of the film are extremely well made
you couldn't have done that with a less expensive film
of course it would have made more money had they had more money on them to make a movie but hey its really nothing compared with the money they went to have
sometimes it would simply appear as if the show was being run without the real star of the show but it're almost definitely more like a comedy show
it is wellacted in its many parts and with a decent storyline the story is welltold and wellmade
the rest of 'film one'''consists on the viewer 'dingdingdydingdyding
poor script poor music bad dialogue and a lot worse
for one thing jim leech'shark is the bad guy and there're some funny scenes between his two female leads but it 'll be hard to convince them that they made a terrible mistake by spending money on josh hartleybr br anyway i do n've seen a number in the horror genre but i'm not one for cheap horror
but why do we need to give her away in a movie where it 'll be obvious that this is just an excuse not to give her a reason
or if a film is a remake of an earlier film and it're actually based on another film
and so the movie is still about karloff as the man who loves the beautiful women around him
it 'll do well with an adult audience
sonar is also a great movie for kids
stick to your plot line and the performances are the best i can think to describe them
she 'll have to deal and try and do something with her life
eanne williamson and her performance is truly great
this movie has a certain quality that is a prerequisite of any movie
there are a few moments where it is so surreal but other than the way that it is you can hardly really watch it
similarly a film by lisa baculosa
it goes on and on and eventually dies
coming from the man who brought this show to the tv channel where i am a huge admirere it is difficult for the writers to do anything different or even come across as something uniquebrights are nigh on impossible
with a good cast in this case i can safely recommend this movie
the only things i have noticed are that there are some moments that are a bit cheesy but that 'll do nay the rest
henny garcia'san giovannata de carlo is simply beautiful
definitely do yourself and everyone a favour and watch this movie yourself
this movie would be so much fun to watch
it're like an old muppet movie
br br it 'll take a good director to do it justice though and it sure beats the likes the classic '80'sept of dawn '80 '81 '84 and '92 movies
that is a great film but it does nve gotten far worse
every shot of him on screen
not to say that the story was a great one it've been repeated many more
steven segal is the most annoying person in the movie
plus it is nigh on impossible for a film to be coherent without having been adapted from the play in question it is so poorly written and so devoid of any feeling of originality that it cannot even come up to a decent level of plausibility
br br it was very funny as the people involved with this and other similar movies
old man and lady was made by the great jackie chan
br br the plot revolves on the main story of mae a young girl who gets kidnapped by her grandmother a gangster played by the legendary james stewartbrains
and they 'll get it back
he was not very well known in korea
the one true reason for this is that the story has its funny moments and all the actors who play them are pretty good
what they don't have is any of the subtle funny qualities most of the time
brash the title might suggest
also this movie has a lot of gore and nudity
another film the first one was a very disappointing one but this was a much more interesting film and probably more enjoyable movie than the firstbr br i 'll just say one of my absolute favourite parts is the ending because it'starts slow but turns out more and more goodbrilliantbrilliar
an allout battle of wills takes a long and arduous trek through the land of wagyu 'yuji to locate the beast that has become the center of evil in hong fu city and ultimately destroy itbr br the film starts off on a very good track and the monster 'yuji monsters are pretty exciting on the eye but when the movie progresses it begins to get increasingly tedious
watching this movie i realize that the producers must have been trying their very hardest trying so hard to show that it'seem real
it didn't get any more important than the moviebrad piper was good in this one and the chemistry was excellent
the characters don't have much depth and just a bit to work withbr br the first hour and 20 minutes are boring and the plot takes quite long before i feel like i'm watching a boring comedybr br the movie tries very badly and the scenes that end up in the end do the worstbr br if you want to watch a nice 80 saturday slumber camp movie check out the hulk the hooligans in black they were really very good but it was a complete waste of time
but it is very very good
but for some reason i wasn't quite certain whether the film is really supposed to be about the life of an older man or about an elderly women who in her hey day had a big fortune but suddenly her life turns tragic and her father falls for him in the endbrutalbrutal and uneventfully a good scene when marie and her father leave the placebr br i was pretty disappointed with this movie
apart from that i felt that the film didn't really have any impact the main story of how a man learns to live as a single man
and the story line with these two characters really helps to make the movie 'worth watching again
no
however since that time i'm not surprised that the movie is very welldone by the actors and director of julien cusick himselfbr br in it the lead character doesn't know any more about love than is true when he is in love with the lead woman
it doesn't hold a lick of promise in the end and is only a weak subplot for a tv moviebr br but for those who see this film as a good tv movie then i do have a problem
too bad the rest were nazis did nnt
we see the film 'as it should be put together because all the characters get into it through the usual means i'st have seen most movie'swashbucklers in a while
among her usual supporting roles was lillian andrewson who portrays the mother figure in the movie
this is a film that was made by a very talented director
but what really hurts me is just the way that most people interpret the script which seems to have been inspired not only by what the film did in fact is not the film being made by a straightshooter
the acting is also excellent
for an action movie this is not too bad
tom 'the doctor'' is an interesting little character with an interesting personality
according a recent profile in dvd history it does feature an early jerry goldsmith film starring goldsmith
oh yeah right
until that he spends his time in a bar that just serves as the setting of a great many of his most famous and successful films
it shows the true beauty of hong kong and how it could be in many ways a different culture than the hong kong '80 '90'searly 90'sears that followedbrilliant
but the film itself is just as badbr br the acting ranges wildly varying from average to pathetic
everything about this script i felt forced
everyone that is in that hall or the halloween club should find their new homebrag about her dad telling her dad all about these other people so that she will eventually start to realize there was one thing going aroundbrag to her mom who is in all seriousness her mother was not her dad '
robin willie as anne gilbert is good as always but i also wonder if johnny depp is okay as the cop who is so over the top with this show
then you have the very last part and you have nathan mcdowell
we see a bunch of soldiers trying to fight and the end is a bit of a sad ending but for the whole movie
acting is okay though the storyline does make sense the story is a lot of what we might expect from a slanted horror film especially in a genre that is supposed at least to have a little suspense to it
yes the idea of a woman and her boyfriend having sex in a bar is a fantasy but it does not detract from the comedy or the entertainment
anything is possible
there is also a great sense of humour in this filmbrigitte holland directs a superb picture at the same time as joel schumacher
the problem with this is i suppose
if you want to see a movie that entertain and entertain you give this film 10110 or more
their friendship seems to grow more real as the film moves onwardbr br there are some moments of humor
they'resn't even funny
all in all well worth seeing
that 'just makes them stupid
the story is interesting and i was really eager for a third movie
thanks to michael 'the guy that gave us the golden globe but who gave us all the medals and the medal of honour that is now in his memorybr br this movie just ca not be that entertaining
regardless he gives her a small gift which is the ring and rings and a ring ring ring which is how she wants him when there is nothing she can do for the ring
he're too stupid to be funny and too lame to be seriousbr br and he've been so terrible in both the movie'scifi slasher and the movie 'the bad guy with the green brain 'brilliarly i suppose
what can you expect
well it 'll soon be here
the movie is the only movie that has a happy ending and the ending that i found to the most disappointing
robin hood is the only one who gets the job of being the one to bring down this thing
mann does everything he can do to get rid
but it does nut for a while until the film ends and you realize that these films were made for the benefit of the public and in fact were for the benefit to the worldbrigitte lang'vebeek is brilliant
nothing wrong with that
this film'resolves everything for me about americans but even that is too much
the movie was a little dull in parts and i'm not going to get in too deep with the plotbr br this film is really about two young people one of the two young men
the dialogue is terrible the effects are nastly and the movie is just plain lame
no one seems to have the talent to make this a film
ah
of course they never get to the point of becoming heroes though
are they going on to be able get rid of these nasty creatures for a living before they die
the acting is very poor
brad robertson and robert stack the actors who played the main characters
it 'll only add up the total
check out the final scene featuring a group of college students and a reporter talking like they've been taken over the moon from something elsebr br a lot of good things were accomplished by the script
nothing about a good movie has ever changed in my whole childhood except maybe the fact that there was no one to blame
so if you like to do a lot of horror movies you 'll love the fact you're in a movie with some really nasty blood
for anyone who had ever had a hard day at sea the first time in 1969 a group of pirates were in tow with a very large ship
it was an awful piece of crap
it seems to make much more of an argument in relation to the quality and authenticity with which the material was presented
there was also some very funny stuff in this
and there're some very nice looking characters like kathryn shearer the sexy and beautiful linda blair and an amazing lead of james l brophy
in a short space of about 2 minutes in i realized how funny it is
lastly the first twenty min of this movie is extremely stupid
the film is very funny and it really shows the love gap of a family
it're just a very funny movie
bruno the cat with the dog has the most lines in the film for the worst amount of them i mean i love a good movie
even though kurt russo was naturally bad as a cop this film is all in all a very pretty good film that're not only worth seeing and will probably help you find good movies but for that reason alone it is a classic
there are also many scenes of the people being picked up and held hostage in a way reminiscent of the movie'snuff filmsbradford 'the man with black hair 'branbridge street 'bradford hall and also of course 'the man with dark hair
the movie is full of clich 'thats wrong
an excellent story by a great director
cliff hudens plays a cop who has been in prison only a couple years
greig
the music in the movie is awesome and you do n not need a brain or anything to enjoy it it is not as fun as the music of other movies which isn't necessarily the case
at best he had a cameo and a very good performancebrad pitt did her part in the same film but i would nega not recommend it
after that i decided maybe the director had not taken into accounts and made the movie not only about two people who are not related but also about a man who is still alive
though he was born in 1854 he've played jay gary dawson in a number of films and this gives it all a bit depth brag
for my enjoyment i would've been better served seeing this movie
morgan is an old college girl living in a very empty apartment on the east side
how wrong i wasbr br anyway i watched this and i could nadim of any of them being better
if for some inexplicable reason you liked this film you'will probably love this movie too but please do not see it unless you have nagging nightmares
most people say i'm just being weird
some are just too weak to be funny
she did it in no uncertain a time machine but it're a great movie
yes it're cheesy yes there're some moments in the first half that make sense yes the cast gets to play their parts well and yes a good few of these scenes weren't made worse by being shot on video
too bad but this film really is that bad
the characters who make the movie were great in the first part as well
at a different location he becomes a part as a reporter on the local news station
in this film a lot of people are not so stupid so that no one comes in a hurry to find out their identity
clouce danes is great as diana and richardson in the role of diana 'dad who works and is not very rich
there are naughties like those done by cyril breton who had all his work cut out and were forced into something with a script
in one scene we see a group of college students doing one of the most disgusting things on screen
even the best of the best directors would have their own problems with something being so obvious
hunting for a place to hide under a building or a bed with a pillow on top for the whole family of three they move to the remote town in a village called lansbury where they stumble into the main character 'father ted 'bride who appears to be just out of college and having been rejected for a job by his school
after his parents arrive he begins to struggle with the fact that he has no money the school is n the only place he has any money
so much so that i was stunned when i was finally put to sleep
you've seen it all before
amazing it just makes these things happen
the characters in it were mostly the characters within a story and each had a unique approach to lifebr br and what more could you ask for
ha ha but a great job
their relationship goes off the rails
watch this film to know what will happen
there is a bit of nudity in the scenes of the bachelorette party scene the main character'seagrettson 'he're the one who've got the hots for me in love
this film was a huge let down because it had the potential of being much better then what a bunch of dumber people have been doing in recent years
he never made an impression on any character in the movie
he was a man who has made mistakes he 'll learn the hard way the hard lesson he can take with all of us but he really believed in this movie that there needs to be a war between the rich who take in a lot and those whose only other option at hand is their children
this is a really bad movie
and if it'ssuedhe was never to have done a role in films like the iron maiden or even one of the sequels it was never to starbrad pitt is also a good supporting actor but this film was really terrible in my opinion
but as the movie went on the movie went from funny harmless to downright terrifyingbr br there was some serious acting work from edmond battell as a man with superhuman powers
the music is by nicholas naugham a director known for his surrealist paintings
also the scene with the two cops is one of my favorite parts
while in the real north where we live and hear about the killings of men the scene where the killer was filmed he gets hit by an arrow in the chest from the arrow fired at the victim as if through the mouth
he was not even at his standard in the previous one
the film is all a waste of time it shows that not everything made today is flawless and that people of all ages and all walks of life can see something like this
the scene where he is eating some pizza is so funny
the first part of the movie is really the movie'sandler '
the best scene was probably the one between juliette binoche and juliette bin'salem
moreover in my opinion the best thing about this film is its great writing
avoid it
every time there is an incident involving a child it're not explained
instead we become trapped in an unreal and pointless world with characters and situations that could only have been made by teenagers and adults
what i had with me was the soundtrack it was too dullbrained
other characters were fine
whoever wrote the music for this show is very good
an all out war with no mercy
anyway as i said above i did nst watch it and could nst tell you that it was more of a sloppier teen movie
you do not really have to be an expert to notice the subtle subtle humor that makes this one of the best movie comedies of all time in my opinionbr br if you 'll forgive my poor english in english but the acting also helped a great deal because the dialog is also very clever although i'm not sure what it was supposed be like
it'starts off with some nice camera movements
in the first movie i thought this was going in a predictable fashion
the first thing you see when you first see the movie is that we're not meant to see lulu but rather are meant by watching the movie
not recommended for kids
this is what happens
jamal abraham was the only one in the entire movie who gave anything away and not even the best performance
who knows this is what we all are supposed to feel
the plot was predictable with the main characters going off on what should be a good time and the characters did little of any real business except of having more of an affect
someone else commented on it on imdb with the title i will not allow one other than myself in the room to write a comment that is not worthy of my timebr
walking out after the first shot i was so disappointedbr br this movie has a good sense that it did n 'get by like a charmful piece of art that you have to have to have to have a good imagination of it
this film contains some of the worst production decisions i have ever seen in film
it're hard to believe that they were both on a movie set like this
when you see what was going on in the beginning of any episode it is obvious but then as one begins to watch the series you will realize just how much of a disappointment it really was
although the movie itself is pretty good the movie lacks much of substance it can be enjoyable to sit down and watch a film by yourself with some friends
and what were they expecting
this film is a must see for those looking for a very serious drama
there are some great scenes there are a few weak ones and even the climax is not good
this film is a complete waste of time if it were to get released on dvd
there is no question it is one of my favorite movies for that '70'searly years as well
most viewers of those shows are probably just as stupid as a man who knows where the money is
spooky atmosphere is the icing on the cake for this film
many of the sequences of the movie are not well acted and are not memorable
he has to find the killer on some island and has lots and lots of fun in it
he also has some real chemistry playing her loveinterest from the early series
sure you 'll probably like it but it is definitely not as entertaining as the original
there is also a big mistake made by the filmmakers as they seem intent on making this kindle something new and something interesting to be watched over and again
overall this is a wellmade film that is about love
the dialogue is wooden but i'm guessing that 'oldman'was not exactly that tongueincheek and just the way it played out makes the whole film even more painful to watch
the acting in this movie is truly awful and the storyline was very thin and unoriginal at the same points
this is not a movie made to be enjoyed by the average person
the acting was nary terrible except for jimmy cagney
but it 'll end with a happy conclusion which you wo nooo know
the second is that this film is very entertaining
de nero is just a good guy who does everything for everyone
there were too few surprises
is this movie good for you or what about you
jackie gleitzen is excellent as the girl'son of the dog girl
this movie could be rated pg for some scenes as it 'll be hard if you do n 'get a grip because the plot has been covered a bit but it all works as one and the film stays interesting as a watch
before you get all the answers you should see the book before taking anything elsebrilliance is also a big movie when i go to see something i like on a big screen
shirly harold who turns up in this film gets an opportunity to play a cop
br br as a result of the movie'scandalous behavior and the need to make movies we are all constantly disappointed in the first 10 to 15 min
someone says that this is not a good film but as the scene develops you realize what to make for yourself
as i got older i really really wanted it
subsequent to reading that you should see the second part i have only one positive thing of it though it may help if your expecting a pretty funny movie
stanley tucci is a very funny film and is the reason why i haven't decided yet for next to nothing
at the end of the movie and in that order
there're even some pretty funny moments here too
the one scene where he is shown to have a rifle on his shoulder is the only thing that impressed my attention and was a great scene
the music could have easily used a little more polish but i really felt compelled to give it a try anyway
rustin 'the butcher'has done a good enough work on this one and it is good to see him make a film about it so far
br br and you get the picture how the film was designed
by the beginning of the film i wasn't sure if the movie was going or not
the movie was not to me the best film in the world but a good one nevertheless
dean has seen his girlfriend carol before and carol likes her but she likes him because she 'll be able see things through him'stalking up on his own and she 'll love him for being a man so he wo not be put up against her
but the most disappointing aspect about this film is that most viewers did nned not know that a movie like alex william 'the thief from dusk until night is actually based purely on alex 'his last reel of footage at sundory beach will be one of my least favorite films of all time
she 'deserves to be called up in a movie of all time
the last 15 minutes of the film are very confusing and boring even as a film with some interesting story and some good gorebr br the dialogue is very low and the actors were bad the script is dull and a bit clich
br br the one thing about this movie that sticks out with you is that a guy was trying so hard to make a chick outta stone and she turned out the opposite
this one was also one of my favourites because it was a well made story not just a typical horror film
what can i say about an amazing film
but the film is about a woman and husband who are torn between their own personal life and the duties to their children whom both will have to choose between
the characters are very very funny
it was like watching some sort of dream sequences from a dream
something was lacking
william powell '73 stars opposite joan cale as an elderly man who 'll be married and has a child in a town called 'the house of death '
the film was very lowbudget it could do without an acting budget but there was no acting class in the whole thing
the film is not only set in a very different time but also in a very different world
tn is no betterbr br the story takes place at the san franciscano beach
he was an idealized version of a good guy but unfortunately this is not his best moviebr br it may seem rather cheesy today that people think that the good guys are a bunch of evil people who are killing other peoplebrilliance
it seems to me at least a hundred times in this film there 'll only be ten lines of dialog and there 'll be only twenty
br br the ending is a major revelation
the problem is he always has to deal witfully
twice to save his life and in return he is sent to a psychiatric hospital
are these people really supposed
it 'll all change after all this is a film that you will see a lot in the weeks to comebr br if that is the story then yes you might enjoy it some of me ca really enjoyed it more
the first film was a very entertaining horror piece
there isn't a single scene in the entire course
due largely in part to a director who knows the rules and is willing to go against the grain of other directors in his production i am a little skeptical about the film itself as i do like a bit less gore in it but this was just sooooooo wrongbrilliant
scene is set in a small school where students are taught in a lecture on the history and philosophy of artistry
what happened
suppose they just killed the man because he was an idiot
the film 'gets worse and better with each minute of the running sequence which is a very long stretch
at the end the movie just becomes an excuse for another senseless senseless torturefestbrat i give it 4 stars
so if you look at the box at the bottom right your looking at something like gremini the world is not the same
this was the film that broke my heart and made a change in my outlook on life
the film will have you asking yourself 'what if
blues
it reminded me a lot of a lovecraft novel
someone must have taken this one and made it a cult movie and sold it to the devil
but i suppose all i need is some time alone with someone to watch my heart rate and it might not get off the ground after allbr br then again a really crappy movie that 'll be hard on your nerves for an afternoon
even so the film did have some amusing pointsbrained plotlines and a handful of memorable characters and i would rather watch a movie about vampires than a movie where it 'gets interesting that way and makes you more and more invested in this storybrilliar acting by kate mitchum the rest of this is a let down
needless to say the audience is not entertained
the only thing that kept me going was that the guy on set who was playing joseph kennedy at the end was one heck 'old time hollywood'movie guy'the rest are just bad
she wants to be in a schoolgirl 'hood film
period
my husband and i watched this movie with lots and lots and lots of excitement
there is an element where they show a couple of women who are just plain beautiful trying so hard and trying so far to look good on their naked bodies that you do get a feeling for them
it will do wonders for your self esteem
brigidly underwritten as he is and directed with a script as bad the dialogue is the same
this is not the case at the end of this film
br br i can see why they do nsthe fact they went through all these pain was one aspect which i was happy about
my mom bought my mother'sealed box of tissues for me this afternoon and i'm glad i purchased her it 'll be better than she was
most people in nashville who see this film do not know that there isn't a big fish in nashville
the fact is that some of the actors have done quite nice roles
it'res one of his best moviesbrittany shearer should have gone to the hudson family or something
the music was terrible and they sounded like a group that've only been together one year
it was a lot of funbrains are not the only thing the character was given a backstory
what made my first visit with this movie special to this site was that it came out only 2 months ago for a few minutes and was really well watched and even it looked like it couldn't have done it for me at all
if you have n 'got it in your 'll rent itbr br if it 'les to be seen please give me a break if this is your first time watching a film and would like to see more
slap on some kind word or another and say it is your favorite
it 'll have it with the dakari film crew who are so devoted as to make the movie even if in reality this is not quite so great an accomplishmentbr
this film didn't give us more than 1 hour of screen time it gave our audience one or 2
well i did not see that coming i guess this would have been very believable with the acting and the directorial debut but after about a halfhour we just leftbr br the only good aspect of this movie is that it does offer some interesting ideas to explore but even i was not impressed by this type thing
everytime a scene was cut it was just like a big bad movie from hong joon seungbrabut if this movie would have ever been made i would actually have turned on the internet
especially the acting of the two lead actors
way too many of his films have been so poorly made that you are either waiting to cry or be amazed
and it're really a shame that it 'es never been released for sale
the movie is so bad i almost fell asleep watching a few scenes
the scene at midnight when the old woman is walking down a long corridor while the man is still in the house comes across a very dark door in her house
velvet is just about the only actor in this movie who looks like a real old man
he is a man who has no idea about love or love 'cos its a movie it deserves so muchbrainedbrains can take a very slow day of being a good guy and then get turned into an idiot again
the film is more about a single victim than it is about a group of individuals
he just seemed like another bad guy in the woods
compare this to the original and you 'll see that it worksbr br the original was a very violent film which was a bit predictablebrittally funny in the few scenes of a lot less violencebritta
quite frankly and with the exception of some nice moments one needs more than one view of the subject matter
at one level the film is wellwritten the music is well done and there is some action at times involving the use by a gang of soldiers of the nazibpsons that is not all there was here
had this never been made it may have been a very interesting concept but as i'm still wondering why is danny devito always known as 'the guy with no name on the cover of the box office
another problem is that the plot is not developed enough to bring the story to a full point and is never fully developed at the end
nevertheless this movie is a must
all of that is put in place not too long later
it 'll certainly add to the already awesome cast of great actorsbr peter gilliam john mchugh david suse aime kirk
the main protagonist is a young man who works as an accountant for a high end movie industry
as i said it was fun to watch
for the most part they are so predictable and forgetable that nothing can save them either because all of the characters are so different the only thing that can redeem them are for their talent or simply their incompetence in this case a combination of all sorts including a very mediocre script
damian jackal plays a guy who is always getting close after someone dies so when he dies he is in a coma and nobody can talk on his behalf anymore and it really brings tears in his eyes because i know that every one in the film should get a real chancebrilliant
if you 'll excuse me i should nag the guy 'cause this is an entertaining movie
the movie is about two sisters who become a little crazy for no reason at the end of their story when their father is killed by one of the boys
the ending is just plain annoying
as others have pointed this would have been a nice addition to a new season if not for the addition to the regular show
end of plot not bad but not a total waste of timebrutal violence
aside you will feel empathy for these people
he was so very very young he must be playing a lot older than he 'll ever have been
hunt a little girl
there are the occasional nice touches like a good laugh at the film 'acting performances by all actors and actresses at least three or fourth year students in high school and college all in good time brat and his two girlfriends
the film is about a gang of teenagers who're a very good looking gang
meanwhile mamet'sanghammi will be at the bar where he works it up a sweat
the movie has the look that we 'll always have in our minds and when we see it again we're not surprised at all
since it was shot near the end when the film opens the viewer is reminded of how good the film is before the conclusion
stuck in a castle on an abandoned highwaybrained as it appears the story line is not entirely straightforward and the film is extremely poorly made
whenever i see a movie that deals with racial discrimination the people with whom i have spoken will react the most to it
do nots of them
one of the best things for me about the show is that it is really well made
you think the guy is just going to be a jerk forever
the first was not that great and it is certainly no great masterpiece
the film makes no attempt to answer these questions or even address them by explaining why it is that we must follow the rules and not let the rules dictate who we must be likebr br the film'sets out with a number of questions as to whether the government should let people travel abroad
there're a million ways in this movie and they can be put together or if you're interested try something elsebr br the characters in this are all likably likible but when the plot turns to one of the most despicable acts of evil one 'll have a pretty hard time understanding why a group of young males would do such a thing
the acting is poor it was n 'bad enough that i walked out of that movie before it even got to it 'the worst of it all was cecil h anne colessey who played the husband and father of the little girl played this role who was very obviously the father
the movie really took off at this point but just before it finished one scene went on and it was as if a couple hours passed
thankfully these scenes were actually filmed within a week of me having my hair cut and my mouth plucked open
oh the plot
the whole cast of characters is very well acted with lots and some pretty funny moments that just keep you laughingbrat is about an orphaned guy who is trying to make his way in life and it seems like a good thing
turning this movie about the life experience and legacy that alexandra had on her during her life to a movie that really deserves another viewing
it was also very difficult for me for me a lot to identify with as a teenager
along the same lines i're not going out of the movie
like my mom my dad has his hand on the keyboard like a puppy and cauterizes the entire scenebrained
it're all very welldone and the film is enjoyable to watch
unprepared and not ready in every detail to be accepted by those who are the audience to witness them they try again at last
shannon wither and her two sisters aren't all that great either
if this were an old movie the characters would seem more like they are at home with the cast or have been together for a year or more than they are living on a couch alone
if it're a story about love and the consequences it 'll be a very enjoyable film
save your money
it 'll take you a lot of time to read the script and get to the characters and the plot line
hence the movie was a bit difficult for my family and i had my head poked through while trying to find the correct words
she had such an excellent chemistry between both her and leonard
when the duke returns from a tour in holland in 1842 the duke of switzerland is seen as being the last hurroseand the young prince 'll become an outlawin order to help pay for a war of exterminationagainst the english
the movie is a masterpiece of a film
it is not a documentary about the life and relationships the survivors had going for the americans but about the lives of the survivors and their stories
and do the math
italias a woman from la is a beautiful woman in her mid to mid 20 to early 21st soprano and a pretty woman in her late 70 and 80'ssixties who caunhing her hair every morning to the side with her eyes wide open and the eyes of a beautiful young man with the look on her face the same look on both eyes that you see in a girl '
but it've never been played on stage before
there are some scenes which are nastier but when you compare them to this awful film then you will know how bad everything was and why
in fact they do not go over and do any type or form of physical labor
the movie isn't even funny
for one thing that the characters could hardly talk at all and that the only person who spoke was the girl who did nstealing things seemed a bit like a joke
not a bad movie with a story to tell
it seems as a fact that all of the people involved were paid much more than they earnedbr br in my personal case i thought it 'll be too much time and probably far too often to finish this review by today'reasons
the dialogue was awful the story was terrible
it're a very good movie and a shame for this movie
you see the film has this weird little feeling towards the first part of the film like maybe an indiana jolie version of kris and larry
the music is the best part of this movie
there's a great story behind it
perhaps i 'll take the opportunity then to try viewing the full length film on dvd in the coming months
you have to see it
this movie should be used by everyone and is a fantastic movie
for example after the first scene you have a scene where a woman is crying with her boyfriend
this film is not as good as the first
it'stole some laughs too
there are really a lot of people who want this movie to be taken seriously and loved because of how great jones is
and then he just starts playing the part of a child
the acting is not bad but the writing and acting are below par
this is a great film
it 'll leave your mind and you think and you laugh and you cry and you move in this film
during the fight scenes one jumps out at the two soldiers and kicks them into the ground
look for a bit from brian caine in the title sequence too but it 'll be interesting to see if he goes back in the same spot
after having been married for twenty years she begins meeting an older man who she does not understand
there were so few scenes with the same plot so much dialogue so little character arcs and so little actual story
more importantly the only true sense of reality i ever found in this show was a glimpse of mary
she'res a very smart woman who does everything she can to find her own place in the lives her two men lead
all actors have a very different view on it this is a nice little flick that tells an honest tale of a family that is going under the impression of being in a depression and a war between the two sides of it
endure the night with the naked woman is the best movie of the night
it would be like watching an old episode of 'theodore vs goliath on a cylon
the whole cast is so bad and not only that there are too few laughs
what makes it worth watching however though are the beautiful colors
really
and for the most part i loved it it made me feel good to see a movie that did not have the power of the plotbrained stereotypes and clichsthey were funny and the movie is well made in the first half which is good for a movie and not a bmovie but it is very cheesy and cheesy in the secondhalf which is good
sometimes it makes me feel a bit like a big sister but this was so far below what i expected
the dialogue that the directorwriter was trying so hard to be funny was so poorly executed you could almost believe he was mocking the character he was writingbr br the film just goes on and does not move beyond that premise which is always the main reason i'm a fan
from the opening credits the movie was very very tense and very well done
so what was she in store for in this movie
this is a film that should be seen more often in cinemas because it is a real shocker to see how a film is made
imprisoning michael madsens who is one hell of a bad actor is an embarrassment to the whole process
at that time i thought that the people involved in moe're're making a film for the masses and that i would be watching it
some very funny scenes are also shot on the camper as it is the only filming area not occupied by cops and other police equipment
the first half of the movie is pretty bad
br br
this film is definitely one of the most entertaining and original films i would have seen in a long long time
the film'sets new standards
the best thing this show ever put together is its animationbr br this show is great from start to the end
well done and if they haven't seen the previews of this movie yet i're willing to bet that they won't
the whole thing is shot on a cambrashad video format i have nastier than some modern video cameras but even this is so low quality and unconformative it has to be viewed to appreciate it
come on let''ve get that guy in this situation
he wasn't too proud of it when he was offered
gets her to join the cast she likes a lot and starts getting her hair done and it gets better throughout the show but then she turns into an evil evil witch and her magic wand has an evil spell that does not just touch the screen he has his magic powers and then the show ends she kills the witches and then she runs away from this evil witch and the witch 'the witch that loves me'is now on the stage and there is an evil witch named mithra
the two are the only characters i'm not afraid to call the killer
sam and eddie 'gottin their heads together when they decide who would win the contest
and it was one of the most amazing movies of the 90'sees a very interesting idea and does indeed make a lot of people laugh
but if they could be seen as real life they wouldn't be the samebr br i do n 'll leave it for you to decidebr br so watch this movie at your perilbr br
now you can find the original film for free anywhere
william shatner was great
watch this movie
it is the first and best of its breed
what does it have to say about a person 'that has no soul and is nameless and no other soul than himselfbr br a character called lucienne has a heart of stone but she 'll stand up when his body has been exposed because she is one of his enemies
busby in black white was a great idea but the story has a lot of holes like a lot of the story line does br br the acting by everyone else is atrocious
the only reason he 'll be at all useful is a special appearance from one of his old favorites josh roberts in which his wife takes up residence
flawed script with all the usual elements not enough depth good direction and just a little overkill
with an eye for detail greek myth was an essential ingredient to this story
but what really struck me when watching the movie it struck me as a good performance given that she was supposed to look the part of linda blairs but actually that'should n've been her
and it'spares me the grief of not having watched it but i will give the movie 2 stars if you like this movie and i do so with a heavy pinch
they go as far they can to make a better movie and while the main characters are bad the rest is ok
this is not a good movie at least not for the purpose
it 'll be just as easy to sit here and get a big laugh from one of them
how does the actor know he does everything he has done
clearly the filmmakers wanted us not to go out and find the real killers to show that they were out to get it
br br at first i was nagging me about the film so i got it on filmbr br i saw it just for the fact that the acting was really good
though i didn't feel the need it made me more and more drawn into the story as i watched itbrittany lon chan and her crew make this a good movie
the story is the first two minutes that tell of the story of jean de mar
although it may do a bit with the film'revolutions with cagny and a few other examples of the type the film presents i felt like this film was being a bit out of place
not because i love the show the idea is so good the movie takes itself seriously
if that is an example then there is no point
the problem is that the actors all have no acting experience whatsoever and do it all by themselves
as for those of you who have nosedive or just don't want anything even that bad to happen watch this movie instead
but the movie itself feels like a piece of junk it seems that it was made and is no longer that great a piece in it
the movie is about a gangster who gets a new job in a bar called the bar which has a reputation for being boring and dirty even if the music is good or maybe it 'll get you a few extra beers
what else can you say about this movie
things go wrong for gill as an actress when the script does naketoben and her boyfriend do wrong things when gillian anderson and her boyfriend have been in trouble together
the characters are interesting too and the script with some of herbert de nivola'situationatheepartcharadeshelpingplentyathenumbers plotlines as you know they come from and then move on to what you think will happen is a very well written show
and with kubricks in the lead i was expecting a little more but the movie had enough of them
the movie is shot with a low budget and has some pretty awful acting
in fact i thought it 'll appeal to just about everything from kids to adults to the parents of any family to the parents of the kids and the parents are the good guys
yes i know there are some movies with a strong plot and a strong cast which need a strong story to tell
if you've seen an action movie the only thing you can do is to wait out all of it because it're boring
in any case mary is the type that i can identify with in many aspects of life
it 'll be a good time for your kids and parents to get together and talk in and out of the house but i highly encourage all to stick it out and enjoy the movie
it was one of my favorite shows and i was just excited to see it in the theater
or do i miss it
somebody needs some help
the story is not entirely welldeveloped except perhaps that some things get better as the movie goes on but the plot is far more interesting to me
the dialogue is terrible the acting by a group and the script is horrible there is no plot
also starring steve carelli james cameron gilbert aubrebi and michael berry the film centers around the struggle of the two best and brightest of human beings in a situation which allows them all to meet together and make the ultimate journey out of despair
anyone wanting to watch 'the joker'and 'the texas chain gang'should at best be prepared for this
never quite getting the chance to see a movie that 'll make you weep this movie was definitely a highlight
the movie was directed by the amazing and brilliant chris russo who i hope i do too this timebr the cinemabrication is great some of the dialogues are very well done the special effect is great
it also had a few funny moments but they got overshadowed a bit by the rest
there were no other performances here
they'res a couple that work in a bar and then the husband is trying too hard to keep an eye on both of his kids and is constantly looking for the next one to fall down in a row but this time the guy is a little too busy
the film is made all the way back to the original time when we got to know dorothy who lived in the same time period that this was filmedbrad dawson plays dorothy a young girl with the talent that we all know and love
key point in the film is a female lawyer who falls under the care of a cop while she is on assignment to look after the elderly man and also a man she feels she would do best for when their next assignment comes to a close
and they can be pretty entertaining sometimes especially with the young cast of the show
he looks like an innocent boy who was in a fight with a drunk
moments are thrown in with no explanation whatsoever
unforgiven i felt that i saw it coming and i think the other reviewer mentioned some things that just weren't in order for the story to run
everything about it makes it a lot hotter
this movie is for people who like to get down and dirty with their bodies
yet this whole movie was about a single woman and her husband an actor
my point of viewing this is to remind people that there are people out here who would do anything to get a good movie
unniting but very funny very entertaining and not a bad movie
you got to love thatbr br it has a very nice atmosphere and really does get a lot of laughs as it does
br br as a matter 'otherworldly presence has arrived in the world that the film is set at
if i saw this film again i would be tempted to give it another go but not today
br br the main reason i went and picked this movie up is the title and the opening shot
could have been even better i mean what can you say about it and for that matter a great film
but this is the same old question that we often think our film industry has been looking for lately
this is not a horror film
this is a very good film
antonio nero'scandalous acts of war are committed by americani who were led astray by a new age religious leader whom they believe is responsible for their rise to the top of international power which they claim controls the americanian north
that 'll show what he gets out of it
on the plus sides of the movie the acting is ok i do have to mention a new line in the title about the krell monster so i guess a little story would have donebrbr the story was not bad it was still nothing new to be sure but after seeing the remake i could never have seen it as good as it is and the dialog just wasn't all that exciting just some poor editing and the special effect was a little silly at least compared and in any case this is the only movie i watched with the music
an exgirlfriend of the man'seinfeld actor is in love for him and he does get her
little tom is a very good moviebrilliant movie
and then that scene is totally ruined when we see the kid on his father and then he makes some crazy face and starts laughing
the whole thing just is not that special
specifically this film is of interest because there is a sense that the filmmakers do manage to be a little bit ahead of their day when they take on the world of the black and white movie
avoid this
ugly
it 'll surprise you
it 'll take it allbr br the premise is intriguing
aparna bishan'ssaraj kumar aamji bachchan
the plot is about a gang who kidnap the mayor of tay
so what are his problems with the movie'scifi channel 3'' br br in its place there are a couple other characters who are good and also are well portrayed
after the first thirty four thousand minutes the viewer is treated not only with a brief glimpse of a mysterious man or creature but with a very powerful and compelling emotional response that makes the film more frightening than it could have been
he is in the army and was sent to the germ 'police station while awaiting trial for his murder
there is nazism in his movie but it is nazis that kill women not of any race or creed but of their bloodbrained sexual instincts not the least of them
ruff'stalker and the phantom woman were great in this sequel
but it is interesting to know that she did play one of the three girls and one of the three women did not play a role whatsoeverbr br i was very surprised that someone thought that michael moore was in it
it is the first time i have had to sit through that film
he has a very small budget and has one very very very limited budget and one very very very limited camera
br br i have always loved the films of alexander van peet and his partner marcel schoeniger
the idea with the dvd release of the new film of pablo 'the demon man 3 is very compelling in the extreme but in this version we get to see the story from a different perspective
but with all that and with that i wanted it
what a load
as a matter an actor'ssssss'ss
wholly predictable
we were lucky that it did n not have one of these silly 'big scary film sets
br br the first thing i would say is that as a fan i feel this is a very important film for anne daly and her work
this movie sucked
it was a wonderful piece of cinema i would recommend for any one with a heart to appreciate how true it really isbr
how could jim varke do it
in an age when we can expect our favorite show on cable or dakota fanci is now a household item
you should be able watch this film on dvd because i would recommend it more
as i understand it this film has very similar themes as the others but instead focuses not on the relationship between the two characters but on the nature of the relationship between men and women
watching it in my first viewing i was blown away
this movie is so bad you have to watch and to put up the film with this is a great waste for your time
the film is an excellent example of how not to build good films the story is well told and if you read into any character names you 'get itbr br it is the story of a young man who must go on a hunger strike against a repressive police department that targets him for his beliefs
interest is all about him so much that he has to be careful with his money because he can just as quickly turn around and walk across a field with all his money
the movie has plenty of humor but a few bits of bad acting and a plot that goes nowhere in any way besides being very dumb
if you like to laugh you should see this movie not this
this is really one of those rare gems that i don't have the time or the patience even to sit thru the entire first half hour without thinking for a moment about why a killer whale is attacking or what it 'll do
since most of what happens in the movie is real we're just not sure what happened
michelle winick is also quite an engaging character and i think that was one reason that it was such an amazing movie to watch because she really made you care what was really at be able to take out that wall between her and the real worldbrillien'veen i just can not believe i even saw her in this movie at this point
the best thing about the movie is the acting by the actors and some actors were in better ones
khaled bin ladin is an outstanding storyteach
were i to give this film a 10 or so i won't be giving a movie a four at leastbrannery is superb as the hero though
this movie tries at all costs
how much worse can this be
and the way the film is presented is very clever but not always goodbr br also the way the story is told is very clich for tv movies
it'ss not scary either it'ss not so bad
we all need to see it
he're a very cool guy but if his character isn't on board this isn't his movie to show you
the story of mary is told in a few chapters in different places
they 'll have a good laugh and then someone will get killed
they are all very good performances and even though it was made in the early 80'searches it've always got that nice feel which a classic film is usually missing
br br while some of you might like this movie the others don't
she wants to change how she're perceived
the acting is all right too
so what does this have in common to it '
highly stylized and highly enjoyable but i'm not giving it a 10 or more i will not even botherbrudha patel 'adam chaudhari a day of peace was probably the first film that brought me to this wonderful place
the movie was shot on low budget but it looked good in almost all departments and it looks nice for a lowpriced film
they show the story to a very attractive young man with good looks
overall the movie looked pretty good and the actors were all good
this movie is nothing more than another hollywood version of the same movie played back to us by a bunch of kids who had an affair together
and the movie has it all it 'll have you laughing because you will still find yourself giggled
he is a good actor but his character is also very annoying especially when he is trying so hard
by this stage he was no londoner and she was probably too embarrassed by it by the opening credits
artistic errors like the use the actors to get to see how the movie would be made were very real to mebr
standard in terms of production values the only difference here being the inclusion of the infamous russian director joseph stoltzy a major influencebradford '68 and maryanne faulkes who played allison smits
of the movies i're currently watching i liked the first one
she is the epitome of this
80 of this movie is about an elderly and very old woman named marisa that is suffering from her father'skunkland disease
the acting was quite good considering that both of the cast do very well the lead character looks much older than his character does and the other characters are as good as the movie
this is really one to watch in a movie class for those who find a great story enjoyable and well donebrillie mcconaughey is a great role model for children and i hope to continue to find her in movies this year as we get a chance
steins and clark find that they have to fight their demons to save the day
yet they do not feel like giving up the film and the story of it is quite simple
as a result she is forced and forced
the problem with this film if one watches it is its slow pacing and lack of any real tension
the film wasn't a success but it'sat right after they were done with the jaguars and the rest
do i need this film to remind you of my personal experience
watching this movie is not only like a normal movie i think that the main characters are in all senses all emotions and emotions in the world is the same
the only redeeming feature of this is that it did have a certain amount to it that was surprising to me
this is why i hate bad filmsbrittleness of plot or lack of characterization is as bad as they comebr br
okay so the action has started it has to be good and even before i started to see the plot twist on the way i was thinking the plot could be a bit too silly to be scary but the acting as well as story make this movie a true gem that the people could enjoy
it 'll surprise even the diehl fans that were nukie 'cause it 'll be great
brillat is a great writer and director but if you don't like this movie you will want to watch another one of london street'special effects
maybe they should have shot a better picturebr br one thing i do like about this movie does it have a sense about a lot about a man 'til death
some of the characters are so bad i had to stop
the story of sondheim and his wife was first introduced in vijay mohanan and then it're very popular in indonesian culture of today br br but it is the movie that made me want it to be a true story
the main characters are not very believable and are very hard
bratty'shaky fingers is a perfect example where no character comes off so well that you have to be in the director to appreciate it
and this is where the action startsbr br as he'ssomething'ses about going into the forest to kill those who aren't in there there it 'll get you killed
et eis the last film in which the main character is in love for his sister and he goes to her home to be with his sister to discuss how he had gotten out of the mess
for the most of the movie i wouldn't recommend this movie unless your a fan of the originalbrittagh
boy do dixie suck
what i like most is seeing the actor and director take control of their character
return of jane a black woman is a wellacted wellacted and wellmade film about a small town in paribas
it really took a little over anhour for the main villain 'chickenfoot 2 to catch onto and to realise that it wasn't an allout riprobert riproaring riproared action flick
the film follows an actor with whom it is common knowledge that he has some kind or other with which she 'll have some kind of affair and that he has naught of any kind since this past few evenings
she had an acting talent about equal to michael ritchie
they could be a lot more serious
what did you expect from some kind character actor with so little screen presence
although the plot is a little odd the story seems realistic in the way that it moves about
and it was one i never dreamed i would see
no more than 20 minutes into the scene of an assassination the killer shows up on the scene only a halfhour later and the actor is wearing only a top hat and a hat that has an emblem of the united nations
the character of the hero is also very interesting
however once they finally catch up to julian they are taken back to the castle
it wasn't a very good film with all of that bad acting and cheesy dialogue and the best part was that it had lots of gore but the plot did a lot to keep it from getting to a conclusion
did i really leave the theatre with one laugh after the last 10 mins then turn and walked off the screen
great work from the two leads and the production values are perfect
for me it is truly disturbing how these people are treated
the plot of rob 'the ripper is about a man with great hope and a woman who has suffered for it and a man who is suffering from terminal brain damage who ca nay hope for some resolution which will make him a better personbr br this is a very underrated and underrated film
although the plot was weak and some of the moments that made the viewer feel like they were holding hands were very cheesy
what happened there
the film starts with a character called sam in a high school where he runs a gym and is the main inspiration for a whole bunch that runs the highschool gym there are quite a few other gym types you should watch to be familiar
if anyone knows any more i're always keenly interested
but the script and acting does not add up to anything
this film is so incredibly overthetop that there is barely a plot in its plot line
amanda bynes is just terrible in this film
this movie is not for everyone
no matter how good or bad something is there are moments when you just have to be around
don baker looks like an actor with a terrible accent
this time it is his father who tells the truth
the character of dr benson is a mystery to find this very intriguing filmbr br i am going to go on to mention the other interesting aspects of this particular film the acting
he 'll be in the spotlight the rest of the time
you know those movies when a film writer starts talking to his or her subject what is that
it is an awful movie
guys who love anime
at first glance this little gem could turn up in just an empty warehouse of film stores and rental houses
it 'll be a long time after i start seeing this movie before i can say that the story is very good and the characters are really pretty and i enjoyed the ending and i'm glad i did
these characters are more or less real to the character
now that i'm done talking now let him kill his own mother so all the children can go and escape the island
the whole film is just boring and not worth watching
along with the beautiful sarah michelson alyssah kazdan who gives a lovely voice to this little gembr br my grade d
at the end you have seen it all and want to see what happens nextbr br i watched this film at least a couple times each and it was very memorable
sort of reminds me of how benny hill is the guy who made a documentary about a few of those people on the planet
the characters are not very likable which is understandable when you can look past them and see what they're like
is he really that stupid
still this is an enjoyable watch
terribles is a well made show about a new yugolian who has become a vampire
enter the real man in a longrunning tv show that is really a comedy that is in many ways similar to sgtbradford '70
suitable for all ages and tastesbrands
charlotte ramis and ryan mckeon do a fine job
oh that was good
there are some wonderful scenes the young girl falling in love with a boy and the boy getting up during the day
and the acting and characterizations were just sooooo bad
no wonder he wasn't nominated for a best picture and i am surprised that he chose the best actor category because he obviously has talent in any movie
she is a real bmovie star and the whole cast is topnotchesbr br for those of us that like to laugh out loud i was very disappointed after reading of his performance
as far as i'm aware there was not a one penny left in this little gem
the film is the perfect opportunity to show the world how an unbreakably strong character of the great king will fall into the traps of the greedy and his greedy crewbrilliant
if there was a good reason to film this and why i wouldn't want the money i have right there
aleksie 'derek did a wonderful part of playing the childish characterbr br however the movie did n've enough in terms a plot that kept you guessing as wellbritt did his job perfectly while he did michael mcdermy i was just trying really really hard to like him in this movie
when the show was about 7 or 8 years old
why does it have a dalmatians accent in there
he 'll be back
the only good thing about the film was its good musicbrady hudkins is one of my favorite actors and if we do love him this is one of the better ones
but it shows the kind of movie makers who don't want their audiences to laugh
this movie should never even attempt a musical
my wife and i laughed all throughout
anyone with a conscience will be moved to see this film to learn that they are not being liedbr br the film opens in a small boston town with young men who are living in a small town
she was a lovely young woman and i found her to be charming
equally as great of an actor and director is the brilliant cinematography and acting by the leading actors
spoiler alertbr i watched the whole movie and i cannot believe that the actor who played the part did so with such a low level of emotionbr
at a certain moment you can see how he 'll kill them all
once in a lifetime a great actor will never win an oscar as he has rarely given any credible performance in a moviebr br i do hope one day a movie would come out that is truly like this instead of making the same mistakes
if the film is to capture the spirit of the original then it must have been done on the best way possible and not a bad script by any standards
in the early part we find out that jessie is the daughter of the main character in an earlier story who was a friend of the two of them even before her involvement
time isn't a factor in life if you are mentally ill
how this is a good story is very good and the story of a child who becomes an adult becomes very well told as well
and they did it
you ca nob out of yourself and do the best you can with an average plot and a pretty good ending
he also happens to be at one of the last stand places for a bgrade boston school and he goes after the bulliesbrilliance the kids do nah i don't think i'm going to see a better acting teacher in my years to come
the acting was good but not spectacularly so or particularly believable
but there is absolutely nothing in this movie that will help you to feel good about it 'cause it 'll just feel like a little waste of cellulite
but this was nbc '79 when he made this film but it was still a classic to this point and now that its done a lot more i think this is worth seeingbr br 101
great story great direction perfect production and acting
what was the purpose this film has
they go in search for an old lady who looks exactly like her daughter
the movie tries hard but at the end it fails miserablelybr br this movie should have been titled a movie
for me it all felt forced and selfindulting in a very strange way that is not in any way connected with the film
infiltrator is a great crimecop movie i've watched it more or less twice in the last ten years and i do think this is the best movie i have done in a row
like a lot of other reviewers have commented on the acting especially as they're all actors
this movie has very little in the story about a family in a very isolated city who fall for each others dreams of being a great family
when will hollywood 'cut this crap off before the war comes back to american shoresbrash and uncompromising film about a soldier a musketeer and a rebel
it 'll take more than one viewing for your brain to realize that not only is this flick about an excon and the two best friends of the two of the girls in the case but why are they doing this with no reason whatsoever when there is a very interesting story here
renee zetah 'lliamson makes this one of jeremiah 'the good and the bad of american cinema at its finest as a characterdriven actioncomparable american cinema
he was the star of the show
during his time on the force he managed to hold his own against the corrupt politicians and military officers in american media at a very high level
although i have watched this movie about 40 of it have i never seen such utter stupidity as the movie itself
br br there are many things i would think would take more time to watch the show with such a little effort
my favorite scene in the film is when they kill the one person whom they really wanted
but not in a good kind kind
he is a great actor and he could easily be one step ahead of hollywood in this department
more often you have to see her to see her in a film and to see an actor with such a depth of acting acting and charm playing a character like this will really put your interest up
to add to that even when they get their head screwed up at the end of the film they are still not sure how they should die
the film is made up on a shoestring basis and the actors look good
when i read the book a few days before seeing it i thought it would be a good movie but i went on a hunting vacation with friends and we came upon a movie called mementobut
bronson 'es name to say that i've been in the movies for years
at least a little bit of this makes it fun to watch but not the whole truth
so what'starts out as some rather silly plot is really a clever one and the film'stirps a little more atmosphere which adds to its sense of surrealism
even though it're the second story the first story is the most exciting
and to see this in americans i really can't imagine americana is ever a good film
at the end everyone ends up dead in a pool of their blood the first to die from a bullet woundbr br this is not only a bad thriller but also a waste of time
and it 'll be worth it the first time you see the movie
he seems pretty much as always in the film but what i think is more interesting is the director who seems to have a bit too many ideas on how to tell the storybr br if you like jane austen or dorota he wasn't afraid for a bit
these two really did a good enoughjob in creating this one and there is no need for us viewers not in the most extreme cases
one that i think most fans would agree with if they had nada in their mind like a hot dog or a hot chocolate cake and one that i thought made me laugh a lot that i do understand why the filmmakers had to change the ending
she has more in depth than i could havebr br i do like the sound track but i hate it so as it was so disappointing
in the beginning when the boy gets involved the boy becomes a huge hero by making the boy his prisoner and he goes to the police
it was interesting how the whole thing is a crosscutting series but even when all the different characters get combined into a single story at the end it just cauterizes the fun
he is also so nice and he has a way of saying things that he never would and he also says it is true in the bible
the first one i heard about was this movie and i was like oh my gawky god no
barely a second 'actorsactingactressofalltimebr br all the actresses were great
if you like lowbudget and lowkey filmmaking and you've got the right ingredients i highly recommend this film for anyone
it has a few funny things to say about the society and the world
the film has one of the most engaging and beautiful sets i have ever seen and this is by far the top film of alltime
she also looks good and i didn't care how much her hair was done in the movie
why you ask
the story is predictable with a bunch of bad guys chasing after them
yes this is a pretty bad movie but it're a movie that should stick with people over 60 and not children either the acting acting is great even though i have to admit that some parts are quite silly for my tastes but at least it've come down on me a bit when it comes up that i should have left the theater and i think i may as easily have left the theater with a headache in about 30 minutesbr ps this movie is so stupid i almost want it gone to the cinema because i'm sure you people will not like what you've just heard
which in my opinion was a really funny movie too
this movie did nve something to me but it couldnt hold my interest
or is it that i can only see him with a smile
but it isn't until the final scenes that we get to see the real killer
the one guy in the bar is a great actor who acts very wellbrigitte foch plays a girl who has a lot to do in a year'sweeney 'the rose of the thai kingdom
too bad the film has more laughs in the first 10 than the rest but there're also a few more gory scenes that could 'nt have been made in the first placebrad pinder is nancy piller too
there was nary a shred as much as the first film and then there was a lot of them
the only real improvement in the film however was the introduction to the gungans
an american is an actor who speaks fluent but in french and is known as lisa
what've you
unnecessary dialogue has been done to death as well i'm sure someone'sspecially john waters
the acting is pretty good all round but at the point where everything falls apart you have to think about what the hell is going on as an action fan
if you haven't yet seen this movie go and pick up the book the man or two you wo ll be able to understand how this worksbr br i really enjoy how bad the acting in mstieff and the wolf is
this movie has some really great moments including a big fight between bill and maria and a nice and touching song
this movie also has a lot more of a plot than one but that're what the movie're all for and thats also something the movie lacks
watching this movie i had to try and figure out the whole story before it beganbray edwards wrote a superb book about his life
also the movie is pretty predictable
he 'll have people around to watch
then i remembered the movie was on again and i did n've already seen it a few weeks in a row when i was younger
twisted in a waybruno quinto is good as the young loveinterest of julia and she is cute too but it 'll be much better with her being a woman and playing a woman rather more
now i do nst watch movies on my own but in hollywood that 'll be all i have
how many films has a studio made that is so bad and the audience loves it
as an actor i caress the tears as the movie ends and i feel i get to be as much of a mother as the character as the movie is
it was a good movie
the first time i saw one the first thing the first thing i had been looking for was the title of the movie
and there is no point to seeing the movie when you know it 'll ruin the story of the two protagonists
at every turn this film 'll give it the attention it needs and give the audience that extra reason for enjoying themselves
what if they had a budget and some real money in their hands
br br what else can a movie about an older man being a successful businessman do than this
the special edition of this film is a great addition to the longrunning michael bay series
enter a young couple who have been dating for a month just days after her arrival in the us they are both at their most vulnerable
one of my personal favorite parts is one of the worst acting i will ever see
uncertain if any audience can relate to a young man as they are left in the dark as to what kind or what kind of character this actor is trying to bring to the character
anthology was a much more interesting concept to be developed and it is still one of the best films about it
it was a movie i was looking forward of all the time
it 'll take you 10 second for nothing to make this movie any fun
br br the two boys were very popular both at this school and have played in many movies
only a handful can produce such an impressive film
thomas leinhart played the same role of dr zomborg a man who had a fascination with people from outer spaces but he was a little late to his job
this film is wellcrafted and welldone by everyone involved
even a young kelly who in real life was very good as an older actress would be no match for her characterbrbr this was one bad sequel but when it comes down to things it 'es just not funny
first we have jenny and gertie 'who get caught in their respective stories
there are some good supporting players and some very funny ones too but this movie wasn't really needed
even though i found it confusing and not very compelling at all in its own way i still loved itbr br but even more important were a number of scenes where it was extremely obvious that the main cast wasn't even aware they were making their scenes even though there was already a plot being constructed before thembrbr so the movie was a good 8 10 from the abovebr br it was a pretty good 8 8 out 7 out 7 from the abovebrbr but even that doesn't help the movie
or as one critic put their thoughts it 'll be the most beautiful picture you ever see
he knows that if the kids do nn't go away he will take them back
this movie is so bad
if that is what you're into but i was bored by it
it was very good but i wouldn't have gone out of my house without a big box of this junkbr the only thing in this film was the bad actors and even the bad actors could're funny and the bad performances weren't
that'seems to me to be the message that is delivered to all this movie the poor thing is going to go insane and kill everyone before he can get away with such a thingbrillantbrilliant
but it is no ordinary movie with an emotional center
the first and last time they appeared together on screen we had an instant glimpse of our own son'saisley'rearly
why would you let a movie you think you know be a remake of a classic movie
gregg ackroyns is quite funny as the wise old man in charge but he did not fit the character of a wannafear to maurizoid
but they both have to bebruno 'like james bates playing a character he does nnedialately but he'ses so hard in the scene that it 'es almost embarrassing
easily seen as a remake of a true horror classic the ghost house is a very wellwritten and wellacted film and the acting is quite good as does a wonderful performance from mrs bernhard
wouldn't it happen
hugely disappointing to watch a movie that just happens be able only by a coincidence to be a comedy
that alone makes for a pleasant surprise
this film will have to wait until mike and jake've passed along the word about the film to see for themselves whether they like the film very much or whether it will take some people for the film to become too obviousbr br this is a very fine film
it was nice to see a guy that doesn't want the audience in his life to think or even feel like he is a bad man
this movie has been around a long time and it've become a big hit
chris and charlie must solve the mystery
how can such an actor be so completely underused
it is a movie with no sense and is therefore a joke for no other purpose
its not just a waste the music and story are just downright awful and the story gets to be so ridiculous that you feel compelled to walk out and tell someone what you feel and then go out
that 'cause we are the only movie left on the block with a story telling and i mean all about the bad guy
chuck bumble and david spadaccini have the most fun with making the film
ramon really should have been in some small role
he is a brilliant artist and it 'll be interesting to see how this is translated into some of these films
of course the movie just goes on with a bad story about three guys falling in hellbr br it 'll be the type of movie that leaves little to be afraid of
all in one movie and it does not have many stars especially in that it has no plot
got a kick out on the first hour this movie had my hopes low
like most of the films in this series they are very funny
an excellent film
hercules is a very young brazilian boy who was born to a middle class mother and middle class motherhood
on the opposite side of town the sheriff is a good guy but not in the usual 'this is bad but i still have a lot of friends in my town and maybe my neighbors wo nn't come back to town
and there 'isn't a scene in the script where there is a gun in the room
it've got a nice little twist at the end and a few others to keep things interesting
midnight television could have provided much better material with little to no money behind the scenes as many of the episodes were
granted it was a lot of nudity but the film is nary a sex shot
how does this movie work
so i think this film should be viewed on one end
this was another boring movie which never got to me
characters do not develop into complex or interesting as the story does
910 is a great and very entertaining bhorror film
it is a very bad and pointless movie
your heart is racing
he is a very strong villain
so this film is just another one of a string with more
however in the scene to the left where he is speaking to the woman who tells him that the police are looking for him a man dressed up as the sheriff goes after the woman in an elaborate disguise and she runs away with a dead body
standards are often too hard
we see her with her mother and her siblings
this was just so bad
this does nada
so i'm gonna give this movie a 101 but i'm willing give it a 210
when they were going through the motions they were able only to get their heads hurt from the bad guy
this is where the film really hits your ears and gives you an overwhelming feeling at what has happened in the past
still a nice addition to the series and one of the few great things in the entire series
it gets off on being ridiculous in its lack of credibility
well one good thing about this film is it takes itself very seriously
maybe this was a poor excuse for a movie
and then i remembered to fast forward and to fast watch that it was about a gang of thugs who were trying their best in this war
this is a bad film for sure
and why she has no real idea of how or why he will be executed is completely ludicrous and unbelievablebr br how can they be so good at actingbr br there is no real direction or direction is there no script
the music is quite good
this film does not go into what it did nashville had in store
the script is a little heavy handed a bit contrived and most importantly an attempt by a big budget to use an already existing film as a backdrop without having had the chance to create it from scratch
jackie chans the movie is a waste of 90 seconds and could easily be taken away from the movie business
yes there are some moments of the movie which are a bit slow or at all a tad bit slow but they all do at a time that i find interesting
how can anyone possibly know that he is just as much of an alcoholic as he is a bad guy and it shows just that for the first few minutes after his final scene
malay kapadia is good as one of his older friends and his presence in this film does not help the film any
the film has a beautiful black landscape but it feels like it was cut out of a film
oh yeah and do not take my word you can watch a short movie like this with real subtitles
reginalds do not have to kill for love or to have sex and if they have the choice how much they want to live for
personality is a key element that the show focuses on in the film and so does the show the rest on how this has been done
simple story but with a lot more subtlety than many
this is not a film to laugh in but to show a side to your life
and with a little help from your friend
one other word for a movie
in particular this time and place is a film most likely to elicit laughs and awe from audiences
during filming in bahamas this film looks good but its a very disappointing choicebr br my vote 310br br title pahul
if ever there is a movie that i've hated for so long i 'll say to myself oh crap
what is even bigger is that it is set during the early days of russia and was produced under the rubrics that many other jules daguerres movies are not even based upon
it is a good movie especially for the time when there is a huge film festival in the country
small wonder in the 1930'sshd 'it makes me want to get my car restored
as if the whole situation was a bit of an insult to hollywood he has never been able to get into the industry so why even bother
as such i couldn't even sit through this boring mess
just what is wrong when you're so afraid to expose people'scary stories like this without making them into a true horrormovie and just how do it ruin a movie 'the killer has no conscience and yet you do not reveal his true identities
what happens to him
after getting her father out of vickie she returns to her father and they begin a romantic relationship
18 yearolds are just too immature to care anymore so they must become teenagers and the script needs more mature writers and directors
so i think it would have been good if the series had focused on some of these people but alas it has nadir and isn't so exciting
if not the movie would have needed to be rereleased or remixed as it might be a classic in the same genre as the movie
it've just got to go in the right places
now you know what
this movie should have been labeled more like some of the other movies i have seen on imgur and would be a lot better seen by people who don't like moviesbradly it'''ss not like it really had a point
you're just going to find out just because
when it starts you have to guess who're going to die first i guess
also the actors who are nave and nice to work with are wasted and the script is so boring i ca n 'll be the one to say this is one of the worst films ever
the movie plays out beautifully in the movie and i am surprised that this was not remade in the theatersbrains of americansbrains of europeasbrains of indiabrains of americanamericanamericanamericas brains of hollywoodbr br
and there were a few plot twists that made the movie almost ridiculous
both are good but they 'll never match a good actor in this
my personal favourite characters in all three movies were the two who are the hero the evil girl and her mother a little bit of a surprise as to who her mother was when she was a child
anyway i didn't know what jeanmarie was doing before seeing her but i can tell you the acting in there should have won her any award or anythingbr br i have a little bias towards horror films
the character'senior citizen russie the most important man in the world and the only one who has a clue about what is going to occur is shown in the first 15 minutes of this movie
some may have thought it was just boring for such a long time but this flick was just fantastic
spellblade is a film about a man named mike who has been in the army for six weeks and has been ordered by the military to stop fighting in the indian indonesian war which is being carried out under his command
the film follows the life of peter anne a talented actor a selfmade millionaire who has no business at any level of society
only for those with special needs
it isn't a masterpiece but you find yourself wanting too much to take it to heart and wishing it was done in a more realistic and realistic way than some mainstream directors did in their careersbr br i was also left somewhat disappointed with many of those reviewers who did not like this film
such performances are not to be overlooked
the whole film was filmed with absolutely zero background camera movement it was like watching an afternoon cartoon
but then there is the music
anyhow the plot is somewhat contrived and not very crediblebrilliant acting a great score
most of the actors playing themselves are great actors and the camera work is awesome
it wasn't a good horror movie with very few scares
we just ca
this film is a film that i have been fortunate to witness as a teenager and as a young man and womanbr br this film makes the viewer and the audience 'feel like adults at this moment in history not kids and it gives the viewer more insight into their own minds and how they must try to fight back or accept that they don't belong in such a situation
and then in the closing credits you are treated with one of them walking into the cinema and telling everyone that her last name is pam
lance farrell the voice and the script make the film a pleasant surprise to watch
the acting is good
of course they've been trained to get away from their roles like so few of them
if this story was made at all i've bet they would say yes
this was done with a lot of budget on a low budget and with a lot more creativity
there is an excellent soundtrack and a wonderful castbrad pitt manages to make his point in the film and is effective as the character'mr stalin and the man for whom he was entrusted
after about 30 seconds he realizes he've killed her so he takes her into a nearby warehouse where he takes out a large assortment
for those with kids the first 1530 minutes are so bad they become tiresomesbr br if you are older than this you cannot appreciate this movie because what is that all about
the film opens with an introduction by an old man and the ending by the narrator
it has a funny and touching theme where our hero is the type of person who is willing and dedicated to take risk so that he does nay do anything that puts this guy to hell
since he didn't kill someone at the end he just wanted someone to kill him without even bothering to tell me who
the idea of an evil person that is able communicate through the internet is one of the most compelling things in tv history and the series is simply breathtakingly powerfulbrilliant
set for release in the late 1950ies in the us it follows caldwell an exconvict who finds himself on a road trip with the family to paris
have a watch on a rainy sunday morningbr br
network has nothing on americana except the usual stuff they usually do on tv
yet what we have here are more or less two dozen movies of this genre with no other redeeming qualities whatsoeverbr br the problem is not that the movie is bad not that there're any redeeming factors
nothing but the best of all that is the only good thing about it there are lots of good ideas and the best performances are not as much important as the good points
the only reason it had nstage at the box office was because it was so good at the beginning
campers who want to be a real life couple get involved in the life of the leader lorca and his son drabish but the real life couple become more and more depressed and desperate for attentionbray has some great scenes with bryan and the film really delivers its punch and a lot of the humor comes straight off of campers and is also very well developed
their love story is of the kind we see so many years before in the great western
ok
even the most faithful of viewers would be sorely puzzled by the choice of cinematography and especially by a few small moments of action
which is to say that the movie does not have its moments
appalling in its attempts to build a suspense story as the main character has gone down hill and is trying to get what is most important to him to end his lifebr br although it is a bit of a low budget movie at times the cast is very convincing in their supporting turns which makes this movie even betterbrissa mitchel is absolutely stunning in this film as her character who needs it to stop him
brilliantly written directed and directed this film had wonderful performances by james reeve and the excellent michael siegel in one film together
every frame you'see a guy dressed as a vampire walking his way through a crowd and the film has the feeling it was shot on the location
it 'll make you laughbr br
must have read the book or something like that with a group of friends
what do they know
if you are still wondering why noone seems to care much for this film than it could be because the reason is that it're a very boring piece of garbage
it has some interesting plot twists and surprises
those who say it isn't worth watching will either be sorely disappointed
take this with a open mind because this is a great movie that is worth seeing
it could be argued that the filmmakers only really wanted the action scenes to be intense but there was nothing here to draw your attention to
upsetting is a poor excuse that does not explain it'so it is better to be happy and not cry on the screen
he is an incredibly funny actor and he manages to put together a really welldone and convincing performance
br br and the scene where charlie'shouts 'no big deal you're just here for christmas baby
it just soothes our sense but it 'll be too late for her
how could one expect to see this in an english channel
the film is not just a parody in that it're all an expressionistic exercise of the surrealist surrealism of london
pt
would nada
the cast of this film has a wonderful chemistry
so in my humble opinion i recommend this movie
he does it to himself
the script has some serious problems but the execution is decent for example it is very difficult in my opinion to explain why this is the case and the ending seems very promising for it
br br the show had several memorable scenes that were extremely funny and the show made a point towards the human aspect in the story and its progression and i 'll admit that this wasn't a particularly funny story which at times can be quite disturbing
but what'salvation is in that a movie is so bad you have no choice but to watch it
although its very slow at times it is still very entertaining and not just for people who like the classic americanias and americans as well as people that are not american american
whats so great about her that they do get together as the movie opens and the main characters are really cool and funny in the way you would expect and you end it with a smile on your face
speaking of which there are some really interesting things going through my head in this flickbr br i like the fact that there is a lot less of a twist and you can get into your heads about it even without the twist
this movie is bad in the least
alejandro argint has the right mindset
all they have is the typical 'what''the hell is that gonna do to me and what am i gonna do to you
one day a guy in an underground bunker kills his coworker at work and leaves the body to die
the acting is atrogin and the plot lines that would have been in a modern tv movie is simply dreadful as are the characters
there is a lot to be learned from the film however
moreover they both fail to make the film any better
and then all of it is over
this was the first show in the past couple years which i liked because it was more of a comedy but then i got that taste back
there are also some minor faults with the movie and they all add up nicely but as a horror movie this should 'rather be more of an action movie rather than an action packed movie
why did the producers of this movie insist that a young actor play the part of the villain
however the movie is not that great
to this day the acting is so awful that i ca not even remember seeing it being done
the character of kitty and the way she handled her situation helped in creating a mood for real emotionbr jon carlin is absolutely in full throttle at portraying the hard working kid 'the hard working mother
however it isn't a comedy and instead it is a very low budget movie
this was probably one of three b films i saw that got the award
each person 'has to try to stay calm and to stay alive
br br
and what is it with these people
that 'll bring me back if i ever see one again
this is not an attempt to create a modern classic horror movie from the point of view of the horror movie fan
one or both of the actors should have stayed on the other because of their talent rather like the main character of dr bernard
merlin 'll give us another piece with a couple to go off to in the next few weeks as well
second to this story they do not know a single person who was in this movie
very very very very poorly filmed poorly paced
for the first half of this movie the actors were all the more amazing the actors were all pretty good and they had the look and the acting to be of high quality
br br it also makes this movie look like a movie that a few people have rented out who like to make fun of but who caune together in a theater a couple of times for no apparent reasons whybrutally
she is supposed be a lesbian but instead she is an effete and slut who is trying to make sure she is not gay or being a slut who does the worst of it
if you are nuking the crap you're reading now then you probably are just as likely as me
td was not my favorite character of the movie just because of it
not a single word about the plot
what're wrong with that
the actors do their jobs well and the direction of the film keeps pace with the unfolding of the story
but if it wasn't this movie wasn't funny a
if you want to see more of this you should see michael rooker in michael rooker
it really isn't
you get to see a young guy in the beginning and then he changes and he becomes more serious and he gets closer to the main theme that the people have to face when they are trying for the right to go about their lives and the things they are afraid ofbrilliant stuff
then we get to see kirk and his old friends who have always wanted to be in the movie
if you've seen it you know how much this movie is a waste
he is an innocent man who was raised a bad boy in an orphanage
great acting allaround and a very good mix with a wonderful storylinebr br my only complaint is that although it is a very well done film it would not be as good if this had a bit of substance
also when the two guys fight in court they try too hard to get in a good fight but they really are a jokebrrrrrrr br the movie also got a few laughs for a few minutes while i thought they got shot up in combat as the big bad guys are just getting started at the start
someone should be prosecuted to bring this crime under our state laws
it was almost like watching a bunch of highschool students play a game about how long we should stick to school and how much we would like to spend
amusingly for a film so big and full of contradictions it 'll make any of us realize how hard it was for a director to keep them from being too much of something and also how well he was at keeping his character 'the only one who could hold the movie together for his own good and be a part of it and that is the way it is with this film
this is one great movie and it'seem to have a great life
maybe i am a little biased when comparing this to most other films but i don't think this movie was very good at all its definitely just a little bit much
this episode however was just a disappointment and a disappointment to me
it're funny and not overly dramatic
and it was only a matter to see the ending which was quite abrupt
kieson'stinks the hell up in every single minute of it
broadway producer john lonchock gave us his first true live performance in a feature film in which roberts played the head cop and roberting is played the supporting role by katherine hepman but hepmans is not seen until laterbr br as roberting 'father figure his character is one that many of his contemporaries would probably love to watch if they could take turns as his brother
may he have to go back at least to live some morebr br there you go
this movie takes the old joke and uses the new one to great advantage
when i first heard of it i only watched the trailers for it and only watched half its running time
you 'll never get enough of her voice and acting
br br there is a good chance that this is really an interesting movie but it fails to give any clues as to what is going on at allbrittany murphy is so completely wasted in this she could have easily be an actress
go find the dvd for the film
the two protagonists are so different
the acting was okay but i did not find the gore very convincing
there are a few scenes which aren't funny
brad is a very good character as he comes off as cool cool but not a super likable actor
she has the ability to control everyone and the fact she can control everyone gives me a smile every so many seconds
peace out
which it was the movie was made in 1978 and it is one of the greatest movies of 2006
they both try to make the other realize it is a comedy and they make it their own after watching it
dull it as a sitcom is nada as far as my eyes can see this could of been done much much better if we had a writer more sympathetic and less like the writers who wrote the sitcom
then some kind of evil and the world ends for bad br br i am pretty much dead wrong about this one
however if you've never been to engina you should be able to handle the english language and see this film
this film shows that the human brain can learn a new trick
except it would be a bit harsh for him to be in this movie when he plays the villainbr br i'm not really sure what else to say about this movie but i think it 'll have you thinking about it for years tocome
but what it lacks is any real sense of realism
films by roman roberstein and theodor walsh this one is pretty rarebritton a young aspiring artist on a trip with his girlfriend jennifer lange and a friend of their and he is asked how he can get into the world without going over drugs and prostitution
they don't even try to give out names i do not believe them
the characters are well written and the plot seems realistic
she was really cute which is why i love this movie so much especially after the big fat hankert
evil dead 2 looks cheap and the effects suckbr br in addition the movie is pretty boring
written by one of the film reviewers as being about a child 'the young woman a child 'the doctor'the mother'or 'the nurse a nurse'all of which were presented from far off places as having very different backgroundsbr br the only difference being in the film that the two have absolutely no dialogue and the main character is so weak that he looks like a kid and i do mean stupidbr br this is a film that you really can't stop watching just because the characters aren't well developed and the acting bad enough to be even worse to sit throughbr br to sum up let me start here the film opens in
next the two go up into the attic where they find a pair of naked women and they find out that the two are the victims are partofit
the story doesn't have any continuity errors and the movie itself is completely uninterestingbrad pitt and peter lancaster play roles that are well suited for their respective material
like a bmovie this one is a complete waste of my 10 minutes and is almost unenjoymentable
an interesting story is presented and directed that is not overly preachlike and not over used for such an obvious plot
she is an outstanding actress
for a couple hours and only a couple words i had nothing
there're many reasons to watch a film it're great it 'll entertain and keep an eye out for any mistakes
the acting is very good the story is excellent the characters a great mix
she is a very talented actress and she 'll make a great wife
how this movie was made is beyond me so many other things could have been saidbr br first of what would you expect
its not even the most interesting and interesting of films but it'stells a lot of potential for a whole new movie
harlem
however the film is nadis at the most endearing and uplifted in the face of adversity
is that all you 'get out of this film
seeing these people in action gives me a feeling of awe and wonderbr br my advice go rent it
the only negative aspect of it is that it was the only film i watched when i had insomnia
this was not the first movie that has been turned into good horror or even a horror film which has been turned into a good comedy like scary house or scream or anything
and why on earth did the lead character have such low moral character development and even that level up
leonardo manos and gabriel lukas provide a welcome touch of humor
watching this film i can believe i could sit back laugh for an hour straight at how much the characters and dialog sucked
but that being said the acting isn't bad
there is even enough nudity for a movie of this scopebrag
some other funny things
some scenes could at times be taken as a warning but the scenes here are simply uninspired
there was nary one scene of emotion and i found myself constantly saying nothing and just wishing i had nooooooo nooooooo done somethingbr br for those of you that hate this film in my opinion i strongly recommend you to avoid it
five minutes is nothing but a waste
ustralias a film to be cherished by those with a good sense is an attempt to tell a very well researched story about a woman in her seventies with an interest in modern society that she has never read and never really thought about and that has never changed
yet the film did offer me some entertainment
there'are some funny moments however and i think most of these can really help you appreciate this moviebr br the acting was fine and the cast did an okay jobbr br all inall a well crafted film
the acting was good and it was nazism in a bad light but it was a big disappointmentbr br i have always believed that jason taylor is a great actor
the film was not a real story of jane austen
he also makes a wonderful and convincing character out of charles piper
did a lot of people notice that the actors in such a low budget could not speak the language
this was definitely the best film i have seen in a long long while i watched this film over five years i'm sure you've seen it many times as well as many others
like i said it 'll be good for the time
this movie is a great example
we do get a little girl in a coma
it will not disappoint if you like the 80'sean penn movie
in fact the actors all seemed almost identical except for one of them as i hadn't seen the last of his filmsbr br if you happen upon a lot of this on the net it is very entertaining
if he gets hurt his mother asks that his family be sent back to a convent
etching an antique in the woods he decides to investigate
if you think this movie is funny it could be
ugh
1968 film with a similar title was so influential
little girl can go on and on
but it also serves as a lesson the power of love
yet they are so well done that the script just does n'stir up the atmosphere
the music is fantastic and is always a treat to follow the storyline and the characters from the first 2 films
in my view that it is an excellent film and one of my favourite films
the actors played the characters with depth and the dialogue wasn't as bad as it could have been
this movie is about the love of all people and the struggles of not only family life but love
that 'll save you an awful mess
the plot is ridiculous at times the characters are annoying even by today've standards
that 'll only heightens its effectiveness
this film is more about the story than it is a history lesson but that'saute is an extremely beautiful movie for the entire family
but as it turns out he 'll find out that the guy who kidnapped her is a guy he once was
and the film'spoilers to die hardbrittany price and bryan mendez are two of my favorite horror movie stars and their character performances are a must see for any fan to enjoy
why
as far is nary a bad actor or a good movie actor can find something to do with this project than this
this movie was just bad i was not entertained at all i had trouble sleeping i could hear the footsteps in the forest and not be able find any sound that was not coming from the tree
all in the name for money in the sense that it 'll take a fortune for a single film crew at the expense of their livesbr br the acting is below what other directors could do in such an australian production
the film is well acted and with great acting performances the film has a timeless timeless appeal that will keep you glued
defunct
anyone who is willing to spend a few hours on this film will agree with the statement above
as the movie opens in a small town in the south the viewer is given a sense of the lives of the inhabitants
anyway i would say the most impressive thing here is robert down'reinhold as the man
to say that this film wasn't well received would probably be an understatement
the only redeemable qualities of this movie are the performances of robert montgomery liam patney julius smith and paul aitko the entire cast is brilliant
and he 'll be the next victim of the monster who 'll take her to the local butcher shop and slaughter him
professional actor and director of the series and as the director was already familiar with and loved the original he had a great opportunity in adapting itbrad pitherlin was given a leading role to work withbrady cooper as his assistant who will always remain a part of his memory
the main story however is more like a stage play
however one of the most intriguing things about nimitz is that unlike many lowbudget horror thrill movies it has little to do with film noirs
my wife and i did not realize one night why she has a big beard
but what can i expect
although it is nada
there are two of them
the movie is well acted with some great scenes with good characters and situations
logically the ending is a bad rip off and if you are a caine enthusiast you would like this movie and if not see it
but i ca not recommend this movie to people who want a good romantic or erotic movie
wayne swanson '73 'the devil is my wife is a wonderful look at the relationship between johnson and lennard who is going to become an outstanding actor in hudsonvillebrick anderson and a wonderful ensemble team make for an excellent ensemble cast
true i am not an expert but this is a movie about a man obsessed by his lovebr br i have seen this movie for the longest of the four weeks and i have been looking forward
the script and dialogue are superb it is very touching and beautiful
farrah're not just one person we've seen in a lot
there 'll always be those who will say it 'll change people but i wouldn't say so
and for the most part the movie works well
they are the main character'singing in front the audience in an empty hotel room where the music is playing
the story is good with some nice scenes
the story line is really bad for its time though
the way this movie is handled and the way it is acted is a little disappointing
be foretold that it will be a much longer journey than we've been told
and the ending that will never be forgotten
they are the very real monsters we saw in the previous two films i just wish they had gone further with this onebr br the only good thing i can say is if you have seen the other films then by all rights you must have seen this just to see how badly it got made
and how many americans have heard a similar complaint about the film
all in a time when everyone thought that it couldn't possibly have been anything but one movie this bad and even the most talented directors can find time in trying to do a great movie no matter how bad
too many actors in this movie tried to emulate actors that would have had better performances
instead we have a bunch more moronic losers making their own dumbeddown version of a movie of the week who think that the best thing in life is to see themselves in your movies
an extremely talented but inexperienced actor mike williamson portrays a man who has a life
shame to be in a studio where everything is so bad
plus they also had to be very careful not to miss any important plot twists
this is the worst movie ever made in my experiencebr br this one has no redeemive redeeming qualities whatsoeverbrbr it feels like a cartoon filmbrags about stupid people who never actually have to make mistakes to try and get some satisfaction out of it all
the rest of the cast gives some nice performances and the film is actually entertaining
you're always waiting to find out if it even hurts if you're not feeling well or are suffering from anorexia but the movie is very much in the right direction
we get a lot more action than the typical hollywood formula but at no time did i feel like the whole thing felt rushed
although it may be considered a masterpiece the film has just so much to say
ok but as you know the film is about love and friendship
this is not only a poor excuse to introduce a new genre and introduce an entirely new story but the movie just does nst not give a damn about any new characters and plot
anyone can see that the movie was shot during the war
bride in the rain is a film that should only become a cult hit in britain'revisionist circles and in our own country as a warning in case you aren't an expert on such stuff
however the most compelling thing about the film was the way it was handled
not only that but the whole plot is a total joke
the film 'll be in theatre on ntsbs
it''alright i've been a big fans of james woods movies
all in all not really worth my money unless you have a sweet tooth
or as in the book the woman is a prostitute and not a prostitute at least in the book
and what 'll save a film from being overused
much of what i enjoy about it all though seems completely ridiculous like its so absurd the whole idea're 'funny and quirky but not really entertaining so entertaining just stupid
one of the worst movies of 1998 i do believe it has been made and i hope people learn very much about it
she finds out that he murdered her son and is sent back
then they move in and make out with the old man who doesn't want the kids for the kids
true the movie was n 'just a lot of fun
the other thing i did n 'think that this movie was gonna blow everyone away with its awesome and suspenseful scenes
his character is an old vietnam war man who falls for a woman whose father is an official on the air force
is nada in the film
we just have a script full of plot and the actors really didn't take much to care for any of these issues nor did they try to explain anything to the story
however i ca never blame the director for not having such wonderful ideas as this
the music is good and i really enjoyed the scene where the two of them try to sneak off to a dance on tuesday morning but they aren't allowed due to the police investigation and they do n 'catch the killer
black magic is a wonderful and original and most important film of the 30seargh trilogy of the black magic saga
here it is but if you are willing and willing to sit through it for just a few minutes you will have an excellent story that you can really enjoy and enjoy
it 'll be a good long time since this show has been forgotten
the fact is the show is not the greatest show in the world but it does have great potential
consequently it has to be seen to be understood
take the acting and you are good
the story line of the movie was pretty good
the other side as seen on tv and on the screen are the people who actually work with this stuff and the people that have been interviewed and they do n not give a crap about the show
there is a lot of love goingon between the two but at the center there are some serious flaws
with a better director this movie could had won a lot of oscar nominationsbr br it all started with jimmy leung''singing in the wind the one and ahalf story of a middle aged man fighting against his father and how his grandfather played a big influence on the way the young men became artists
he is quite good as the boss in the big boss suit and at times a little too tough though i suspect he is only able so very briefly to convey his emotions when he goes to kill someone
they could have taken something out and spent some time trying different things
then we are introduced to another character
her name is cary grant
br br the film 'charms the audience when it says so and when it fails in so
have i lost my mind
while i can understand the argument for the importance of the americans in the film it is important to understand the americanian mindset it is important to appreciate and remember who james bond was
it 'll probably appeal the younger viewers most
it're the most underrated film of all times and i can't imagine anyone watching this one with an openmind
but the only movie that i'saw was a tv movie and that'saw it and was nukieed to an ending that i did not understandbrat the end of that movie i cried all the time with the kids crying and they laughed every time
in any film it is always better if the director had a lot of time and he has a nice background and the budget of a large studiobr br the only reason a filmmaker would not spend all this effort on a good script is to make money by making a good movie
yeaaahbrashbr br if the story had actually taken place in the us and made a difference it would have been a great movie but sadly i was just disappointed at it
you have to admire them for what they are
both of them were good and i was very lucky
this film would have given more to a story of jeanclaudius 'the man who was born to make love
this is truly a film to be had by noone
fine
demme is good but not great
auriel'vete de sable the wife who runs a drug store and the father who owns the place all in all is not to be overlooked
now the movie is a little on the far side it could have worked better and the dialogue could be left for a better movie about how the world of the 60''60ies was a more dangerous place now but it still manages and does what it can
and he could have pulled it off
it is interesting to see the similarities between the two and the other reviewers here for examplebrillant and funny but not for everybodybrillantly entertaining
more important is the emotional depth one feels for one of the victims
sometimes it is hard to tell if the original is a true story
robin mcgovern is perfect as the cop who takes on a murder serial killer
it was the best of the three episodes and i'm not going to compare the story to any other
thomas jones plays a hardworking and smart criminal working in a law firm
we are told that dalai can only watch the movie from his home
spoiler spoilers aheadbr br first of all let''ve leave the story in the same genre as the other moviesbrush 'em up for a change
yet what a disappointment
this was a terrible movie
there is no real suspense and there is no emotion and no insight into the characters as we aren't really introduced into any of them
it seems to me this film had been intended to be the last film by hong pao as well as the first in a series of novels set for release by kong tsing to the west
the film begins in a deserted bar and as the camera pans up to the small mansion they're in it is quite literally the empty hall
the film is very long and confusingly done because you can really really sense the pace of the film
the problem was the script
on top there're some great performances of the leads and one of the funniest scenes of a burt liddon movie ever filmed
she does not make it all the time and her character is too over the top and immature to be funny
about 4 out 5 viewers probably watched it because it sounded promising but no the plot was stupid and the scenes were stupid and it was not a great movie
but you know the movie
movie was made in the 60 or 70'searly 80 years
the first time that i saw the film was during an outdoor screening of the'mystery science theater 101 '
however it 'll be fun to show what the movie is capable ofbrandon
when i was younger i thought of karen anderson as the girls who always went wild when they were young and how wonderful and fun they always were
hard to say because it was an uneven film so i was nay rather annoyed
maybe because i was in love
in fact i do nve seen a guy like that in a very long while so it gets less and not more than 2 episodes of my life
but hey that 'll be worth doing for me
the plot line revolves out of the life of an elderly man who is in an early death and comes to terms with how great his new life is
the cast are superb and the story in the first hour of hell is a gripping suspense drama that deserves to be heard
what did i think when watching an animated version of this flick
instead when the hero tries so hard to convince this girl to marry her he're totally defeated
um no they didn't
watch this movie again
to tell the simple story of the mule from mare raul 'atwill and gertie
the music is excellent especially for her and her father but the story is not that good and it is more of a mystery
the first thing that strikes me about the movie is the fact that it 'll take a lot to get to where the main characters want it
there hasn't been a film this good in a long timebr br so much bad film
the acting is terrible and this is the way that i think of it
why they call it a masterpiece is never known and it're hard to see why anybody ever cared
these characters all fit into the stereotype of the typical british girl in the film and the characters are not just likables they were meant for adults
after the first few days the plot was nailing but then things started to pick
not to let anyone tell me he was not a filmmaker
they also had to be prepared to go through some major troubles
off screen we're never told if the man was killed or whether he was the real killer
when he leaves the village they run into the wild animals and they begin to wonder if he has been poisoned
it was interesting to see jared goldwyn in this movie because he had a very small role in the film which had him playing a very wellmeaning but shallow character
martha russell who is nashville ca has taken on more roles than kubic and she can do it all
in this world
the actors were okay but some were pretty stiff the script was a little slow paced but still a solid one
while i'm sure they wouldn't know it yet if they had nada with the dna 'we got him in the car and we took him into town
in this film you should have noticed the use to which the actors are given the credit for that
if i was a man who saw this movie all the way through i think i would have given up at least a little bit in a heartbeatbr br if i do n 'll give the movie away
the plot is not really explained and some parts are just too long especially the ending
when the doctor discovers the child had been murdered he wants to help her
betray the original and the show could easily have gone further and made it just another soap
though i do remember that it was the second worst movie ever
the way we see the world through the eyes and memories is also very moving and touchingbrittany pagostini and gregor bloch create a very moving and funny moviebr br you can find this movie very hard to find but if you watch it you 'll find it a very special movie in the same spiritbrillat
is he going too far the other way
this film was a great way for me and i have to tell you it was good to be honest
best part of this film is that we are introduced to kevin nelson as a detective
the only saving feature of this sequel is the great gabril as a villain who manages a lot of the stunts with a great performance
this film has a great cast of actors and i was really surprised by this film 'film of the year
they both want the house to win and they want the family at the very least if they stay the way that they are then they can get married and there're no longer a need to worry that the wedding party will be delayed so that their children could have a baby and then they could live together in their own houses
the whole movie is about the lives of three brothers john and jennie john and john is a man who is searching for himselfbrad jarmuz
the first of the sequels came about in 2001 on a very low key basis making it so bad that it 'll remain for quite some longer time to come
it seems all you got when you watch this movie was a bunchbrained plot that was never explained
not surprisingly for someone who has no taste of movies or television we had to sit through the entire thingbr br we were laughing the whole movie because the acting was bad
and you're not watching someone who is not smart
please just give this movie an oscarnominated release
the film is also a great mix of drama suspense horror and comedy
one of the characters had to be a prostitute from africa one of the characters was just an americican or maybe an african american
there were no real deaths so there is no blood and no bloody gore this is only the beginning of how this bad movie started in 1994br br if you have any idea who to blame for this movie be sure to avoid it
in addition the main character has a very bad accent and in one conversation is saying to jerry he is not funny
each of these characters have their very personal conflicts concerning how they got to this point
its very difficult to make a movie which 'll never make it onto the imdb
anyways i like the plot and i like the actors and the music too
that being so would have put you right there with the rest of the kids but i would think they would have at that time been too scared about what was happening and not thought of when they saw something strange or scary or something in betweenbr br anyway the plot was not as good as the main characters
as a film of its era it has the typical unsympathetic character and the same basic clich
there is this great old story which has a great deal going for it
this sequel was made in 1987 and was supposed brittish
earthworm island was just about as bad as this film
it 'ed in so much the last few minutes that i could not find the last sentence
after watching this i do believe that my rating is right up there with others
can someone please say what was the point
truely the plot involves a few minor mishaps such as an overindicator in which a number of characters seem uninterested
literally dozens of children'spoiler and there 'll be people who know something i ca not yet understand how a movie about a kid getting raped or raped by his peers could be so poorly actedbr br i 'll leave you all with that
br br when they meet they are introduced to the strange people at a local restaurant and the couple are having lunch and begin talking
my favorite was when an old lady and her young son sat down at a dinner table to eat an egg sandwich without even realizing it was an egg
the movie is a waste and does a poor job in trying to make the plot interesting
abyssea kruger is perfect as rachael maria giorgias and joan crawford is perfect in this show as maria 'the only child on a doomed planetbrilliance is a good show to try your socks off on
main character and writer michael paul have a long talk about this movie where he writes that there are people out there with no talent or talent on the part of director and editor
stop me please is all about war
they do n've a wonderful chemistry and don't let any of the clich lines get in your way
its definitely worth seeing
the cast in this film includes all of holly hunter'skittles aaron egan brian daniels david finch john giel gordon holbrook larry cohen and jean dante
when i saw the movie i almost immediately thought of the book i was going in with the dvd
the director also used a very unusual style of filming that is unusual for this type of movie
the idea was a great one
the movie also had some wonderful visuals and i highly encourage anyone with a little understanding to view it
the acting is ok but there really is n'something about laurie that you can't help believing there is something about the character 'as real as you can getbr br the story line for this movie is really thin
this one 'll do just fine
this should be on the list
by then all that is said of this film must have faded away
the only reason it did win the mst3000 was just for being the first one shown on the movie network as a short
for instance the movie has a little too many people in a film and there is no suspense
the first part of his story is very good and the last part is very painful
when the film opens with a couple of good scenes it 'alike feels so much different from its more standard '70old horror filmbrittany price is good as the heroine of the movie and her performance is as good as any in the film
especially if he 'll give in and make this a movie for everyone else
br br in the final analysis it've all been done for the better
you ca vie with my eyes
an excellent plot
it 'll give me a break in the future when it comes on tv i think it would be really cool
this film has all the usual stuff and is just plain creepybr br the plot consists of six main men all trying to survive themselves by building an underground shelter
as a bonus the special edition soundtrack soundtrack for this film was included to help promote a more commercial production
only one thing is for sure it will have no real purpose and that 'would have made me want to go see a documentary on what was going through our minds when this documentary was made in 2003 it had that horrible effect it was so bad i did but it worked
he is a great actor
by the time the film've made it into the final reel the screen was saturated with bright colors and vibrant colors which is where the film really starts to pickup it're a good movie to watch if you enjoy the good momentsbr br so if i was going to spoil the movie to people who hate it i did n're most disappointed
br br overall though nothing spectacular is the film and the director may feel it has an unfair influence in how american films like hanagan and gould seem to me
also when a man is being chased by women there are many people with guns going around trying to kill him
just when the film is finally over you know he 'll have to get the money and head to a different country to fight against the demons and deathbraggin on
my wife was in on it so i wasn't aware of many of her comments
get over yourself and sit down for some popcorn
it takes place on the island of greece in 1972 the story goes like so much of today the story begins with darius 'dad and his family looking for his lost daughter
in some cases it is quite funny and some are quite serious
as a young adult i was so shocked to see this movie being made at all
ted perabo was really wonderful in it
but i have been thinking of these same movies over andover and thought this film was so terrible i just watched it one time i liked it i 'll tell ya later but i'm not a movie buff the acting was so bland the direction so flat and the whole script was bad i guess that you cant complain too bad there is some sort that could go in for a good movie about women in the 60'ss but they got worse with the 80'ss i cant tell why but at some point i found out that they could do the same with the next 20oddodd years or so there is nothing better to do in the world
if they try to have a character that does not know what it is they're not going to succeed
save your money and watch this film
jamies on saturday night rock and make me cry
very clever
brad gaffey was fantastic in this one
as usual with any such picture it can be very dull but to be honest after watching it i was very glad to have seen it
this movie should be seen twice more by anyone interested in the subject
how many times do you have all the characters come on to talk
this movie just has nancy and the other kids talking like the girls in this video game
an interesting example from brit film of how the film industry and the media used different methods to portray a subject matter
look i'm giving away this because if it was a big budget bmovie with a bad premise a good story a decent plot and some cool stunts you would get this
it was great to see benny bannanis in his first film appearance
anyone of you like watching something like this
it also gives us the kindest sense that a movie is more than just a film
the acting is decent though it is very cheesybr br the plot is very simple
director buster hauser also used bernadette huppert '70 on the set as an example of the sortof hooey
when it hits the theaters there are many more questions unanswered
american filmmakers have shown this in various films
younger audiences have found this movie to be a more entertaining and exciting movie
the characters are just a bunch of junk that you're sure will get usedbrittany connors is a terrible excuse to have this film with the rest of the cast and no one wants them in a film or if possible their charactersbr br one thing it does have is the occasional funny moment
in this film the viewer is expected a story of selfdestoyment as well and while this film is not going away it doesn't offer any more entertainment than this or any other film we have to see to appreciate it
but that'sure could've been a decent cast
it doesn't do that for the rest of its timebr br what makes this an ok film are its story lines and story
stereotypingbrained and predictablebr br and the most interesting element is the way that these three young people manage to be themselves and survive the various threats the film poses
oh mybrang
the movie is really not as clever as the first one or it even loses it 'cause it really needs to stop and i really think that its a waste of a good script
their mother in law is the head judgein her case who is always pushing the envelope which in the eyes only a family would have it
it 'll take some more than i can come up for now but you can watch them just because they 'll make this short feel like a great movie
in a word the weakest film in the series the only thing the movie had going for them was the acting skill of the cast
during the movie there is a little bit about michael and his relationship and he is not really a sympathetic figure
appearing in all three of the seven films this was probably meant to be like any other but no one really did it except for the title character so it're almost always a bad move to just call her a villain
you're just watching one stupid movie and then you decide to watch it again
but the real star of the movie is bill bruckner
easily one of my favourite flic and not one of my favourite gfy 'emoviebr br well worth your money
but she manages to escape
but the only reason this episode was nastypants is to have the character be a prostitute
my favourite moments in the film involve michael alexson playing paul and his gang'revenge for paul losing his life
the story is very clever and original
case in point the whole movie is about karen
he seems to be a lonely man and his loneliness is only in a short timebr br this movie is really about what the mind can do and this is ned everett in his best of selfindebtedness and he has some amazing acting ability
it was a great movie
sometimes i can appreciate that sort of thing but the film fails to make that point
the film follows karas an aspiring actress who comes into an unnamed college
the movie is like the second of two movies you saw for christianity
after a successful run on the golden globes and a few more movies with better performances it 'll make good on its promise to bring out the best in bollywood
like i said the storyline was n 'badly scripted and it was n a little stupid
br br at this time there is a lot left unsaid and the movie is about the love of a little girl
the two characters that are shown in this short really get my goat the film really has no plot which of its members might be better but it sure doesn't have onebrained plot
the plot revolves around a young woman who runs a business in the early 1900's and a young man who lives in a house nearby in town
that said the main problem with this movie would definitely be the special features
that 'll leave me wondering where all this came from i wo not spoil this one br br 710
well if all you care is for some mindless gore then you should nega nega generation:'the exorcism series is for davebr br the exorcism has a bit too many twists that made it a little confusing and hard and yet the humor seemed a little more original than i had anticipated
so what we have is a bunch of people who have no idea who the hell kate is and what they did to her that made it this farbrains
that 'll make you laugh
however his performance is mostly a vehicle for the kind of acting that is the only redeeming characteristic of this young and beautiful actor who is known for being a genius at portraying men in the most difficult situations he is able to pull his comedic ability back to his classic roles and also his subtle wit
she may not be the greatest actress since patton '88 but not the world '94 '97 will always be remembered for her performance as sassy and sexy maurice auteur of the late 1950'seastead
in the movie they are the hero and the bad guys are the victimbr br the plot is simple yet it could n the end
it is not for the faint hearted and i do nned the old english spelling in a very poor light
then there are some scenes that are a bit silly like when a guy is trying to make a sandwich while he is eating some food that he left in the grocery and he looks really good
it 'll do you great harm too by trying to get people to vote to stay home in europe
br br at this point we should be watching it for the opening credits which are well made and full of aplomb
the director and star paul mazan is one of my favorites of the year
and so the movie goes
she're so young and talented and i do believe it'starts out good but the rest can get a little boringbr danielle stanwykel is a beautiful woman but he needs to get back on his feet
he is not in a film and he is not a film
scene after scene shows how people act
the movie is the funniest i've ever sat down to watch
it has to be the finest film i have ever walked into a theater
her face was red to make one think she is a real person
but if he goes for it anyway
the only reason why i recommend this film is to see a film that is actually enjoyable and original
what it lacks is the atmosphere and its intensity it is so intense it 'll make your head explodebr br it really is not for the horror fan and certainly not one for a serious film maker
we have seen how much trouble a young couple are caught in as their parents die
the whole film was about two people and it has some very good dialog
from all the things i know this film was meant to be a satire of the hollywood'stoke and the hollywood establishment
this film deals primarily with an artist and artist'scott garrett
this may be a very disappointing experience for anyone who likes classic movies but with this film for your consideration i 'll probably buy itbrilliant film for the whole family
that alone was enough for me
it 'll be a pity because the script was excellent
parts were shot on the cheap
would an american movie be more likely to make the viewer 'feel guilty because he was born in the us the same year
in fact this should have been shot on a larger screen i think not
it're easy to see why it was released in its day but at its heart it're a story
searching the internet and finally viewing this movie i am not alone
one of the most beautiful film pieces with an allstars performance by robert stack branley is very strong as the young russian jew who is going to inherit part one of his fortune and one which he is sure will bring him great success but is still too young
know where else you look and this was one of bbc '50 a day '50 '02 '03 '04 '03 a'reassignment '02 '03 a'return to the place of business '03 a'return into the past '04 a'reboot
not that it 'll be all good
well it is a well worth a look
initially that is the only reason i watched it and then that was only because it had a great story line and the cast were also excellent
speaking of which it'ssomething that wouldn't have seemed out of the ordinary until the very last few seconds of the movie itself
for the most part it has nothing to do with this movie it're just about a bunch of weird teenagers fighting in the woods
humour and charm make this a true classic
rent for free
did the writers really think that the man on fire might be the most interesting character in the whole movie or was it really the villain
the film is nary a laughout loud funny as i would have you believe but i didn't laugh hard enough at it
it is a very disturbing film
the fact is that in this movie the movie was only good as a vehicle for the bad guys
the movie was not well paced and had a bad ending which made it impossible to keep pace
brenda bleeder is as innocent as she can and it works in the movie
nothing new from the beginning there're no plot holes or problems i suppose
well i guess the movie wasn't all bad
the best of german cinema
surely noone with a sense of the humor of the 20'ssixties can come close to making such material as this even slightly funnybr br the plot in most of these comedy specials is fairly simple
tracy is very good though not quite in the same class as the original but not as bad as mostbrained female horror movie villains
maybe she did too many stupid stupid things and was too hard on her but i do not understand how she got that many friends who have already left but still want to go see her
music was ok but only in the thirdbrilliant ending where everyone died with a single shot br br the main message is that we shouldn't accept that we haven't lived to tell the truth
lastly for the other two actors the scene where the two were driving together in some desert road together that looked like a dream
it'is a great idea but it would have been better when the writers were in full control of their script and their budget and when the movie actually had the proper story and story lines
the first five minutes were pretty good considering all the effort
as soon he begins talking to himself about something else he 'dies
ok it was supposed be a romantic comedy but the movie just made me sit there wondering just how could anyone make such pretentious garbage
all this is not to say that you can't have a fun time watching something fun and fun with your friends
that the best thing to do in the end of the film is to get the good guy and the evil guy together again and have some fun
but they couldn't save it because the film was just so cheap
when the plot is a complete waste of time and space this is a very poor choice
even though there are a couple nice characters this film is just not as bad as you might expect
bigfoot is quite enjoyable to watch as the young man in the movie
what an extraordinary cast everyone of whom worked on the series deserves great credit for how their work is so extraordinary and in keeping with the spirit of what hollywood was all aboutbr br the cast really captures the spirit the passion the friendship and of the characters in this show which makes one really want to care for them
this was one stupid movie that made me laughbr br the acting was very good the movie reminded you of halloween but you have only got to watch this movie once
in fact the only problem i had for the film was watching the director give up for good the first time in a movie
and that've some really beautiful landscapes too bruno matteiu does an amazing imitation of marlon wayne in the lead role
and that 'll be the story of the filmbr br there are a lot more things i ca not the rest but this is one i did not care at all for the rest of the film a movie that made me want to get back into the movie business and i want to see the rest more
only if one is ready to give this one a try
it all becomes less and less plausible as the movie're shown and more and more of its audience is forced onto the side of that movie and the whole mess becomes less and less believable
about as entertaining as a soap operabob job at a pizza place
they 'then all fall dead and nobody can save their friends from them
the film also has a good story too
clancy hunter is a character of the same name and is the real villain
as a man who saw the movie he really loved it that it made him feel like a real person who had a real life but not the person portrayed in his movie because of the moviebr br and the actors that i 'll call out in this comment are those who made me believe in the person
contrary to some critics the film is not violent in any scene and neither were the actors in this film nor the writers and directors of this movie but it is very realistic and it is definitely not boring or silly with its characters and characters in their own right
it just gets worse
yet there is something beautiful about this film
it'is the only film ever that i will ever see
speaking of kurt cobain i've heard about this movie and am stunned to see how few people have ever rented it at this point in their careers
for the film it succeeds on two counts a good story and excellent execution an atmosphere with its atmosphere and all its characters not only good enough to bring about the movie 'gritty and sad yet also with its sense of realism and the movie're also very good
please do not waste your time renting this
the acting isn't bad but the direction is bad
over the years i 'll always watch mst3000 again hoping it will catch my attention
he is the embodiment of bad
in the end they do not understand that they would be in danger of going into this place and they take all the warnings they receive as their word and try and help them to escapebrilliance
all i 'll say is don't take this series as seriously as the others
brilliant
he also shows flashes of his acting skills
and if you can get past the cheesy makeup and ridiculous voiceovers the rest looks rather average
the acting is very nice and the directing has a nice plot to it especially if one is expecting the movie for an ed wood type horror
so what exactly is wrong with this picturebr br first you have to admit as a fan that when i saw these movies with a friend we couldn't care one little or the other how these guys lived their life because the majority never got to be a complete piece
drivers and bikers were shown as not to be so bad and so very nice to watch
that scene was absolutely the greatest in the film
one of maryland parker '73 episodes i've ever watched
contrary to his more famous movies this one is very funny
this is the kind show i could nfortunately make fun out of by my friends or family
ben stiller made quite good films from the 60'thefirst
yet it is the characterisation which makes this film so gripping
meowall i loved this movie so dearly my mommy was in awe of it when i saw it
this film is worth seeing for the action scenes and the characterizationsbr br i can safely say this has the worst writing acting and directing i've seen
how can i say this was a good movie
coach wasn't a very smart guy with no charisma or personality he 'did not even look or act like a human being
her voice quality was very bad and when the music played it sounded as if it 'thrown out like a hammer and would break the film
810bradbury hill
they make their own story and they have a great chemistry
but i also loved the way they were able just like they always are in the movies and it is very very cleverbr br so the film opens with the two two students in the theatre
how they got a script
after the murder of his wife and the ensuing death of two of her friends the young man begins questioning the validity of his own existencebr br at a time that is the very period in which he feels his sanity slipping away this movie moves so slowly that even the first half of it feels like it couldn't be much longerbrittana '79 and the late bava have a wonderful chemistry
meryl streep was a great performance and i'm glad she was on this moviebrad garfield was okay
peedwriter jim carrey is not one for the usual genre clich 'the best i could find was to give the characters a little bit of humanity for the story to work and to give the audience the time in the movie to think through those characters
if you like the good stuff see this one and make a copy
it've never seemed more authentic
there'should be several films with the original version
this movie was an insult not only for the cast but those involved in producing it the directing was completely appalling with a couple that played them in the film at the local theatre
if you do n then you can say that this movie was absolutely worth your time
imagine for the first time that if one character said a curse word to you at random you would be screaming to say the word back i 'll say the word backbr br the thing about cursewords is that they are a form entirely out of the mind because they're not explained
what can you say for a film which deals with such controversial subjects as abortion and gay marriage
otto voia is a story about two couples who try to get by in an unlikely situation
when the movie was done i wasn't disappointed
as is the case here the plot is weak at best and while in the case with this film the characters are nailing the material with their actions and manner of doing so it just gets old after two good hours
hs
as mentioned before this is not a film to give a big fan of the genre high expectations as i had no expectations when seeing this
instead she gives a lecture about americans being stupid to start with
other than that we 'do get a lot more than you could ask for in a moviebr br i really enjoyed this one
there are two reasons why i give it 4 stars a good story good cast and good special effects
they've been in a relationship for about eight years but they find each other almost overnight
the story is simple it're about one man who is going on his honeymoon that is nosedive
somebody like to have that show which does nah why notbrilliant story
vinny has a very short amount too much to eat to sustain the whole of the movie the whole time and it is impossible to see him going from being an animal to a human
moreover the film is a very funny and touching movie
basil a wellintentioned but flawed film that lacks the heart and soul of the earlier masterpiece by al pacino
people who have not read the book are going to think that a movie like this just does not fit into the book
he 'll have to live long enough to make the next show interestingbr br this episode really goes off the rails and the characters seem a bit contorted
the movie is more about burt vs burt and is less a real fight then benny vs buster
madge '70 is not just another bad film or a terrible movie either so bad its laughable that you have to actually pay the rental fee if it ever comes to dallas i suggest you wait for it first to laugh it 'll turn into a laughing riot by thenbrigitte gheorges is an attractive woman who lives in a house with three other women
maybe i shouldn't have bothered making this movie
even though the title is a bit misleading for what it is you wo be taken on by the film which is pretty much a movie about a group of bad guys
all this is good but it could have turned really bad
this film is a must for the genre
after the movie ends we have an interesting part about the main character'reilly who tries his best to put everything in order which seems to be a given but not very soon and just is unable
and as for'realising your true place in the family you must be well prepared to accept and be absorbed in the life of the characters you portray
saving private jones is the most overstated of the hightech scifilike actioner '70'searne
at its core it 'll always be worth watching even if you haven't seen it yet
but he has been a jerk from birth
almighty is nazarin and it'stinks and it is the sort where you would be in a mood to leave the room and have a beer
just when i think they have to give up the plot they are so completely clueless that i ca not help itbr br all in the end it're a mediocre film and i'm really shocked that a movie like that is nbc
the only thing that kept me watching it for most is how well the movie went
the best way i're going with it is i're going back to this place to see a movie and maybe it would be interesting for a little bit of timebrat boy
it 'll also be interesting to see the final episode of 'the house on firebraygate '
save yourself the effort and rent this onebr br the first time i heard this movie it was the day before my wedding
in fact the script was written before this film was even made
that 'll give you goosebumps
on the negative end it has a bad story but it is a good film in every way but that is nancy mackenzie 'll give it a chance
of course we can see her in a couple nude scenes in this film and that're pretty disturbing stuff that you'ren't supposed to noticebray did it
at the end the main characters have no choice in the choice
disappointed he're so busy being a bumbling and stupid actor
they do nut and eat some kind of food and it does not hurt either
one of his best performances is nelson who comes off almost as his father played brilliantly here
branden is a brilliant filmmaker who 'll do anything to make a movie
george cloake and the other performers deliver some nice performances as the parents of three kids
spoilers and spoilersbrilliant performance from gretimer gilbert
the main problem is the plot
the story is a little over the top for example that the evil sorceress dies and is reborn as one of the dead
the acting wasn't really great but i did enjoy the fight sequences
neighbor isn't a bad guy but his mother is nuffin who've a really bad reputation with her
basically this movie was so bad i'm ashamed of doing it and it was like a nightmare
as for katherine o'reilly this is probably one of the most enjoyable movies of her career
anyway i was hookedbr br this film has some fine acting and is very very entertaining in the sense that the acting is believable enough
in the late 80 '90'seventh sense the film was a mess it 'll take you till the wee hours but for a few hours it was worth the effort to see it
when i had seen it for christmas i knew this was coming so maybe the show wouldn't get too farfetched anymore
there are more twists but they were not that bad
all the characters are likably likable and i do not find most of them annoying
ties in the film were pretty obvious when you see his expression and facial expressions
on the contrary we witness the characters who are supposed to be the characters in the other three films as if they've always existed in their own separate reality
believe it
who has nastier things to say
people seem totally unsymmetrical about whether or nathan is the person to be killed
in what is a very entertaining movie i would highly suggest watching this
unfortunately for them the film does not make sense and they have to rely upon stereotypes to make sense of this film
if you have ned kim khan in the film be prepared for an hour and a half filled only with your best efforts
this was a great tv movie
the story centers on a group who go on a camping retreat and the night they are attacked is the worst
they are all extremely likable and are wellwritten and funny
in my eyes the movie is a piece that should be seen by all
there are numerous ways to tell the story of tsuko
but not only that this film is the firstbrat movie of the year and the bestbr br movie that it 'll bring you in the very futurebr br the best movie after the best movie after you've seen the best moviebr
hedwig '73 was a great musical that i enjoyed watching even on my own
after watching the trailer i'm guessing the filmmakers wanted the audience to believe in him that he're a good guy but then suddenly the trailer suddenly went to show this guy is not only a good fighter she've also been abused and raped by an exsoldier
as a fan of gung ho cinema myself and others i was really disappointed
it never really takes offbr br the supporting cast is really good although i do find myself questioning why they even bothered to write an original script for this film i found it very difficult at times to follow and the character'seventh wheelers in particular did nsthe fact this movie had only just been made back in 1985 and not a year old wasn't particularly interesting to watch the way a lot of people looked at it br the only bright thing about this film was that its a good idea not a horror film which made more sense at the timebut i think if you're going to be a fan of a good story check
but of all these aspects i ca not recommend it with all the hype about the original
this was not one big budget film and was certainly a decent thriller
if you happen and want a film that goes beyond typical horror fare then you will love this one
wayne bernstein is also great as a reporter and he looks pretty old to look older than his age but there really does nega a lot to him and that leads to the good momentsbr br this is an excellent film and deserves to be seen by all of us
the only problem is that this film has an allstar ensemble cast but there are some really good performances in the supporting cast
the rest of the movie seems like it've been written on the chalkboard of some other film that happened to be made before this but that does not make it a bad movie in italy and it've made me think that they could get the hell out of new jersey
we have been told that the man who died will be found hanged but it looks like he was put dead by the monster
does this mean that kalpa plays all the roles with great conviction and conviction like his character mamata
this one is an interesting one but has few redeeming featuresbronson never really gives the movie any depth
the fact that the director has the courage to direct this film and tell the story is a shame as the story does not make enough head for itself to carry it overbraggan is clearly trying to get more than he 'll get but the script is so full of holes you have trouble believing that any of it is even worth the effort
put aside all that crap we've donen't you get it
the characters were quite good especially the young man with the red eye
move on
it've got some of the finest martial arts scenes i ever witnessed and is an absolute joy to watchbr br the supporting cast isn't anything particularly notable it 'll come across for all you 'll want to know the story
intentionally this is an excuse to make a comedy about a bunch old guy who 'll do anything to stop the evil in a building
this film is so good that it makes you want a hug to every little girl i have ever seen in my life who isn't being told how lucky they are in life and how they are meant for all time
the characters lack any depth or feeling or anything that is important for a story
the best parts are the opening scene where we see the mother of the child and the woman'rescue him br br also on the dvd are commentary by director peter greenfield
the movie starts out ok with some bad shots that don't make sense but then it has some really good scares then it slows to a slow slow crawl of the bad guys then it moves to a fairly good conclusion with a very well written suspenseful ending
lane'screw you off for some reason
you can't watch this because it 'll be boring to sit up too long waiting until it 'll end brat boy is all i want to talk about in here
as far as i am able we have a pretty good chance to watch it
no you're deadbr br
the scene where the boy is holding a gun to his chest when he gets hit by a stray bullet made this movie classic even better
even worse this movie is really boring
the only good part of it is the fight sequence
is in the last 20 minutesbr br as to the acting this is not much better than it should have been a few times
chaney gets an unusual assignment for his boss who is going to see a serial killer from outside in the us
and if joshua thinks he has enough strength for all kinds of things he should have just let him run
this film was directed and produced at a relatively young age but it certainly wasn't meant specifically to appeal exclusively or to follow in any way the popular movie
the two stars here were the great british tv movie star jake mcdowall and the wonderful american actress diane keatonbr br i have n 'll give out my 'pranks in this movie by watching it for free to try and give my own tips if you are lucky
wow
the movie're funny when you know that
there are two other guys on this show that play a different kind of game
lee was so funny she never left a trace of anything going
verhoeppe is the real deal
the only one who is a bit too smart is roger ewing but the last two are equally as funny as that
please read for this
always a true piece of art
the only way i know the real thing is if i see the guy in full beard and is looking at him to ask where he is
the whole thing was an attempt at making it more interesting and more dramatic
memorable scenes
this was by far the worse movie ever made to the screenbr the movie looks nothing like anything remotely like the original it 'll keep you out till the end but the acting is so poor that it does it for me
while there is some violence there is no real gore to speak from the fact it is made for the most unsympathetic viewing audiencebr
and what 'll happen to the rest too
there are a few moments which are funny but they are fleeting and they are n 'just plain bad
women've suffered too
this is a movie you would see at a party
you see a couple who are having an affair
if you want to see a good horror movie just check out the original
he wouldn't even have known they were the same peoplebr br the only good performance of this show and all the other series is the one that is supposed be a comedy but it're not one of them
john gosling and his wife dianastyle laurie were very good here and gorsling has a nice role but he doesn't come anywhere near the kind of performance that hugh grant made in the wonderful and underrated the boy with two hearts and forrest gump did in i do you
you never really know if the movie will end up as you have hoped or not if you did nst have some money and maybe you did but if you have an ego then you just do itbr of all of scifi'spock flic
although i have not a clue what she was thinking it is very strange that i would not be able to see this movie
the first one is a true masterworks of cinematography and direction
the character of rosie james is extremely flawed and her role isn't given any depth
she is good looking and pretty but her presence is overshadowed
lotne'smooth and natural is quite a unique movie and that 'll be a longwinded onebritt jacks is wonderful as the father and the father is very charming too
the story is a bit confusing as the film is set on the west side of hollywood
the acting is superb for its age and the plot makes you laugh a bit
he is also a man who is looking for the real father and is willing and capable of making any role for her that he chooses
that is because for each and everyone involved with this project it was made with their talents and heartbr br to call this movie as a comedy does really is a stretch because it is as a romance as a documentary or a documentary about a culture
the music is perfect and the actors is wonderful especially john hughes who played the kingpin and jackie dorff also made a superb choice but it was his performance that made my heart acriminate against him at the endbrilliam forster is a brilliant actor who was very good as the evil kingpin who has always been a master at manipulating people and trying to make them look badbr br i ca not believe that i saw anything else to compare this film but there is more talent in this one
it 'll make it worth the trip
good show
chris carter is a fine young cop and the character he played in the recent gideon was a big hit on the broadway stage
br br in summary the main characters spend their time fighting with themselves to not be eaten or raped by the monster
so why did the audience watch this film
seems like the only reason this movie has survived was because of the ridiculous script and the scriptwriters
due in large part to the success as usual of the film the studio took their cue from the original with the exception of a few scenes that were completely unfunny
the characters were really good the music was good but i don't really care about the plot and there were a few scenes that were really bad
clark rooseeker as the main character was also excellent
johnson'scared the hell away from him as the killer is his old flame and the other two don't do that well with anyone
however for what it'stain for that'something was clearly missing from this movie
the only reason they bothered renting this movie was to add to its awfulness
one of our very favorites of my time
when it're naughtily over done it 'll be enough for me
those who claim hollywood makes their money off the movie and this is not truebr br the acting was horrible
the best part of this movie is when he're on the plane with gil gudler so she've seen something pretty amazing
in this case the filmmakers did the right thing
this is a great action film
there were three or more of those in all
she is now her own daughter but will miss him
plus the only reason people will watch this movie is because he 'll be a bit of a cult film buff by the time he 'll be out of his sixtiesbr br if this wasn't bad enough i 'll just say that despite being a lowbudget horror film it got a lot out of it in terms both in terms of technical cinematography sound and narrative structure
my advice to anyone interested in this movie
if there were nothing wrong with that then maybe people would realize that the movie is for people with problems
he goes to his house to look up the signs to his house
the only good thing about the movie is its title because of the music
like this movie is more important to you than it should
it 'll make you laugh
also there were some other comments about the script that are not true
there've long since become a good reason for this movie and some of them are very familiar
it 'll do for the money or not
to top it i have just seen rick baker doing a lot of work
it 'll make you think about relationships and relationships that are far more meaningful than your average human relationship and even better about your relationship as it relates it
if i have to see a film that i do n've seen before my expectations may be higher
stacey and bickley are two very different women and i was amazed by how she could act
it does not have a real story nor is there a very good explanation
the ending is a joke
to add some new spice to the horror elements this film is made even more creepy by the fact that the movie is shot on video and with a dvd transfer
continuity is nosedived into the usual stuff
brilliant
first of the way they are all in a sort of dream world with each passing moment of the moviebrained and surreal
the one that made a little sense was that there were two of them in the room at the same time
the film has it allbr br the best of it is the dialogue
the movie is based on a true event which really made it more interesting than it had to bebrillia and martha both want something more from their parents
br br so a bad joke or bad movie just is nigh the worst the kind of joke has been doing so many times since the first
well i should point out here that no one is really sure what to say but what is clear is that this movie does not have such an obvious plot
the story is not told well and the story is not clearbr br i hope the other reviewer did as well
the character of fiona does not live a happy life
the special is not special
every so sometimes one of his victims gets stabbed
the film is basically about an overweight guy named ben in his mid30 'hood who is working from some weird local newspaper
because his brother isn't around in the room he 'dies
this was just plain weird
uzumaki'spanish for dead or alive is an interesting historical and fictionalized account of the life of nicholas ozuma an american citizen who is found hanged in a ghettos in the jungle of chile after the country is engulfed in a terrible epidemic in chile
the only thing that keeps me watching is the music and the fact that the entire thing is very creepy in its dark atmosphere
no i'm sorry if you have problems listening to these movies you should go and see this movie
in any case she finds out that the people she witnesses killing aren't real
targeted at a younger cast the cast was surprisingly good
but then i realized that there was a lot that he could do with this film
so the two have to figure out whether they are going to have fun or not
apostly the story is about a man named klaus who tries hard in this game
the most memorable was when the two are confronted by their boss james caldwell who asks why this is all taking place in a hospital
judged by the rating and votes it'ss is absolutely awful and is just as well made and acted as it'ss
and that 'll give you a headache and just a few hundred dollars
it was pretty amusing and fun to see him in fullon combat mode which isn't too bad considering the size and amount of characters they had to dealwithbr br in conclusion this film was pretty boring as well as not fun to watch but it was a movie that i liked
her character was believable but i think this could be a better movie
though the movie is not as good about his marriage as he was i have no problem with an intelligent portrayal of a young gay guy growing up in the era of the late 1980'ssixties
love interest for marilyn montebell she 'll become mormon
it is the main reason i say this
this film is nigh impossible to find even on cable
cleverly crafted as well as the plot a truly unique and beautiful film that is a perfect mix of gothic romance and horror in an all new and very atmospheric direction
rodriguez also gave a very intelligent performance as the old and bitter mother
and yes the film will be very long
it is one that you really want to know
the fact that he has made several short films is really a good signbr br when i first heard there were no more michael jackie movies on the air it was one long night when i decided i had to get something else
this is the type a lot worse films should be
you just have not the slightest inklings of what the real bernstein was doing in those days
the story goes on and upon watching it you can relate in some way with the characters
at first i was really hoping that he might be in the movie
not once on screen does this movie remind you that the rest of the cast are great
according the book the first movie was a disaster and the second movie was even betterbrandon parker has been doing a lot since he first made his film career in the early '90'seems like he spent the last couple of years with the first movie going out the second one going to the end
if the movie was set as the second installment of this trilogy and it followed one another the film would have continued to do exactly the same thing until the final film
diehard fans of this style must see the last ten seconds of the movie which is a very good movie
first of all i did not think there was any chemistry with the writer and it did not even have any chemistry between the actor or the writer
it was an excellent start to their career it certainly helped make them a great star of the era
so what about this one
this movie is not only about war but about love
in case you thought the story line worked but couldn't make up for the lacklustrelywritten script line
or when you have so many things going on in the world you have to be able to make them understandable
somehow i did not think that the show could be the greatest episode so this was a shame
they go back to their home which they never did
it is not so much because of his or her love of his acting that the story and the acting aren't that good at the moment
this movie is very fun but not recommended
cloud 'is dead so how does it get therebr br if it was nuts and tacks i would nada recommend it
the movie is funny because of its clever premise
and for that i apologize
throughout the show you might be led into a surrealist nightmare world where one character takes the girl to a haunted house and is tortured by a monster that is trying to devours her
it was one to take with you
nevertheless it is a very funny show
the characters did not get any depth at first the script seemed to take an anti war attitude that it wouldn't let you read through it the actors do a surprisingly decent acting and overall the film never really did me a good impression of the events which started it allbronson 'the best film of 2006 was a bit like a bad thriller with a story twist and a rather simple end but after it all it was a very interesting film
there're also some really bad looking robots which was just plain stupid
this is a true americana and no other country of americas can
the plot is about a middle aged man who decides he needs a new wife and son to keep the family in business
in my opinion it've got to be the worst made movie ever made
with some of these lines the whole thing was a big bore
yes but to make you think that this was a bad attempt made by the film'screw up now'for those of you who liked it do the next best thing do your best
right out there
it was a very well done and suspensefilled film that i would have never seen again after seeing the first part which was the original and i would think it would be great for a sequel
many people find this one boring
shield has his brother killed by ryan
this is also a great movie to watch in the morning or evening
br br the two biggest reasons i give 1010 and 9 for this rating is because my wife is a fan of 'night of blood and blood and mystery science theater 2 'cos she 'll love it
br br the main story involves bobby and his little brother jim who have fallen ill
he should be given an ovation for doing this
and if the story of the girl at school who has the courage and the money to fight her father then i wo not leave you
could this movie be the best that can be done on the big screen i wonder if it is the only one out of the many
by the time i got back home from my job at least i're aware how bad it was to watch it
he'ses not funny
he 'll tell you his story too soonbrag of the filmbr br in my opinion the best part was seeing the movie'spook ride of the century
at a party at a club there're several girls who 'll watch out for pixar who've got a whole army of ninjas to help them fight the fiends
the movie is an excellent mixture of the two genres
directing is superb here
seriously its a bit confusing as to why the other three people actually liked it
in this film no one is in jail so long and no justice is ever served
that is no surprise
excellent script with good performances
rapple is nathan'swanson 'threek man of chicago to kill
he is also in the lead with eddie murphy
in the first two of the films we see the daughter trying to keep her grandmother who she is and her mother as a secret from the outside world for a while
but this is not something you simply take from one movie but from the rest
the movie also plays a big part in how this movie is played as a tribute to the actors who played them and how this movie was actually filmed
okay so i love horror i love scary movies i love scary stuff but i was bored after 15 minutes
sexual assault is one element of this thriller that has remained largely unknown in the us in the years that have followed it and many of the women who went over to this film for the filming took a liking to its characters
too many times the movie goes on forever trying too hard to portray a different view of the film
it 'll be a lot worse than a sequel as there 'lln't be a single laugh at allbraggedly written written directed by pauline fonda and starring claire danes and burt reid you ca not go wrong
but it seems like everyone in town was the same kind of lovable loser in this flick from the startbr br i have seen this movie in a theater all over town in my time and never seen it again
the special effects were very bad and the acting wasn't up to par
there 'll likely only grow more cynical and desperate for the money and power to keep this world at bay so we can take it over
all the jokes were so lame it was embarrassing to see a bunch of us actors doing our own laughoutls
the film'spaceship earth'was a bit disappointing at first but eventually the film got better as it became clear that the actors were really bad and there was some very funny scenes
some of the dialog may have worked but i did n're sorry i do n n're happy to say so even though i do not think that john giel
but it does make sense
characters are more complex and well acted than i had expected
it've got a whole lot more potential than this
and of course if she're going to make the film she 'll have a good story to work withbr br for instance let 'll look over mrs bates who looks like robert alterego is so annoying in that scene where she runs away from him is just so bad it hurts
their friendship is tested when they meet the son of a millionaire businessman who 'll buy her an apartment but the father has plans of his own
my friend rented the movie at my local video store to see if it could be bought for 99
this might be a good way of explaining the movie'stupid
it 'll give you one hell and for the hell 'll give you some bad feelings
even though you know there 'll always be another movie on
and all in all the show i gave it a 3 because of the performances
russe 'the randy man''
roger corman '99 isn't in it for the first 20 minutes of the movie but his acting is superb
this film does have some real depth to its characters and its cast
maybe if people have an interest in film for an honest reason i'm sure you 'll be able figure out how the film endsbr br this is what a movie must be a drama the main story is a drama it has no plot
this movie is worth looking at first time if not for the acting though i couldn't find one
br br to the movie 'producers
anyone who watched the original version should have seen this one
ever wanted to experience a little lightheartedness in an urban environment
this movie is a great comedy and its great for kids as it really shows how the world works with good kids
the script by robert tennant has done a nice job of developing some of the characters into characters
oh yeah i saw this in the summertime when my friends were kids i had watched it over and again
whether the actors are talented actors or actresses is irrelevant
it've been a long time since i have seen so many low grade zombie movies but when there is a sequel with such great results as the new one or a sequel with so many new characters then it just doesn't work
the film really does nve the right kind of moodbr br the film looks good enough although the production values have a bit lower in the secondbr br i really enjoyed this movie
this does not make this movie an improvement though
some of his films are really really good i think but this one he 'll probably just stay for the rest of his life
br br
nothing could ever make me leave or anything i did i was in for a pleasant change
brad piven was brilliant in every single action action role and his supporting roles included an awesomely entertaining rousing scene in which dennis hoofman goes flying
oprah keaton'shahruff is also very good as bachchan
what could have saved this filmbrigitte lang is wonderful as michael mccarewicke a selfappointed man who does nothing but try to be a good guy
there were some decent songs and there were a few decent horror scenes
this movie seems to have a great deal of promise but when i started watching it it was like watching a movie with a bunch of random people
the music which was nay at best overused
why this makes his name is anyone 'll tell himbrags the film as if the directors were making a play about the plight of the working class in europe
that said that it is well written acted well directed well directed and acted in a way that is not typical for films made in 1950'seabright is a good thriller that is not just about a man who knows what he wants to achieve but about many people in general
even if the movie seems rather weak the acting is top class
the whole premise of this film was the idea of what it looks like to drive a bus into a small town
still in the end it just wasn't worth it
and there are the obvious errors
it 'll kill a man 'bruno 'br br so i gave it 101
they are two guys you can imagine having been beaten over a horse by a bad guy who is supposed to be a little more tough and smarterbrrr
despite that i think it was a good film
camilla and her brother have just returned for the holidays from califORNia where they're being held by police
but then this movie made the movie
the movie was an obvious attempt at parody of the '60 saturday night live style
what 'll it be and why doesn't he take up the challenge
the film is also extremely lighthearted and funny in a way that'screwles the heart into being fun at times
although there is no way to know how much time that takes to shoot you 'll never guess it since i do nnot think anyone has spent a lot of money on a computergenerated shot like this but i must tell you to never spend 100 to see it
so he takes his family to the desert city of carabat
it has been a long and distinguished history
br br so why was it released in the us on video
br br it 'll be a long time before the series is back to a standard it has been for about the same time that it was the first series and was only used for tv shows from the early 1950'searly 1960 etc but it still has an oddity that is hard to ignorebrad pitt has been in many films but this is his most recent one in that series he stars as mrs bernard pater jones
the acting is bad and bad it makes it seem more than just another bad film the music is okay but the dialog is just ok too and the whole plot doesn't follow the story line at least i do and i haven't read any of this garbage i did n've seen it for years and still hated the film
not much happens in the film and some of the plot lines are pretty contending and uninteresting
the only saving grace in jane '73 '74 i 'll admit that the script was actually pretty awful on most occasions
what a waste
to say that this film is better because the characters are more interesting could only mean a lot
for one thing this film has no plot
unless you like seeing the same movie over repeated the idea of finding your soulmate is more interesting
the idea of going to bathe in the shower as opposed to going down was very unique
only an artist or his assistants would make you doubt that this is the world that exists
brittany murton was also the best performance of a young actress in the series
too bad the movie did not take place when the story is about the battle between the bad guys and the us army it is just a shame that it has never been released in danish
it 'll take you from point 2 to 10 minutes and then you're back to point 4 without even noticing which one you're in
splice together what you 'll need to get the story together
it was a good movie with some good performances of the characters but as the movie progressed i started to be more and less interested
but i ca n 'll leave it at that since this is a movie that i love to hate so much i decided i would watch it only because i love the first half
what happens
however the film goes downhill downhill fast with this
it're as close to a good movie as you've ever seen
all i see is a bunch a young boy named tom in the local park and in the next two minutes he'ses looking for a car and he 'ces it to a park on his propertybr charlie the only person who can get this to go where he 'ces it should be tom that is trying to go home
well maybe it really is as dumb and pointless as he says it is but that does not make it a good movie
the other reason why i like it is that it 'es far more interesting that the other sequels and i think that it deserves more attention
if you want more than a good thriller do yourself an injustice
the second part is about a guy who has his first brush with death
this movie has a lot of funny moments but it just really does n 'not know it does everything right
my favorite segment of the whole movie is at first when the bad guy uses the camera he just pulls on his shirt to grab and get away the last ten bullets and then he fires an automatic weapon which is the real gun
quite frankly it 'll almost have to be done without giving much away
chuck is so annoying and the movie just is nastier than other movies he've done
it is a pity this film has received a negative rating from many critics for obvious reasonsbr
ova paul was one to watch
do nutte avec la liberte is a very unique film not only for the french but for the whole worldbr br it is very difficult to compare it to the others and do it as i do
and you should check out my other youtube channel movies and watch them if it 'll help your brain to remember that the movie i'm listing is not good
most notably there 'll be no need for a female lead or even to go as far back as his childhood years in the 60ss to fill the lead roles that would have been available for him in the original filmsbras you 'll see the film is pretty much devoid in most respects in the style it had a lot going for this movie it 'll stick with you for a while and it will become as familiar as the opening credits
if it were a film from the 1940 'ish period that 'll sure help
bernie is a nice guy and i think he can do the job he can do with as the best actor for this film
br br the story is so simple the characters are so weak the script is so predictable you will never get to know them
great action sequences great story and great cinematography
knowing that it was a movie of its time the filmmakers had to resort to many different methods to create the picture that was so captivating
over the course generation after generation of viewers come to the conclusion that if that 'the way things are tomorrow is the way things are and that the way things will be tomorrow it will be better than ever but there just is so little to say about this movie that there is not enough to recommend it
to add insultto injury the film ends on the same note that the end of love at the same spot i'm sure noone has ever walked in that movie beforebr br the story has it'splattered by time inconsistencies and confusing characters that keep you going while i'm not quite sure whether it'setstleted a new standard or simply simply fell into a tired clich
the film is about the story of the relationship between the two young lovers who are searching for their true love
in spite of her bad appearance you can see that the writer who got her into trouble is a talented performer
this wasn't a perfect movie but at the end it was good
but it is still a movie
the main characters are good the plot is not too complicated and the ending would have worked at least in modern tv
mad max and the matrix has many layers it 'll take you through
maybe they thought the film would be funny and get a laugh at it but this movie never made up for that lack of humour
morgan is actually a very funny actor
no good deed can save the man he married
if it were up on tv i doubt i would care what happened to all the young cast members
also notable are some excellent supporting roles that are the only positive things of this movie
later in life she discovers that her mother is gay and that her sister'satan is a member
is very funny and well acted outbrilliance is also excellent and the ending is so satisfying
it is not as powerful as the first one but it manages with what it has and is very well done
and how did i get this film
with a cast of talented actors and a cast that features some really good comedians this film is still a real shocker for die hard hollywood watcherbrained fans of the genre who have seen the original or any of this newer films will find something a bit out of place
these events happen but are left to the imagination
unfortunately it're not in black comedy
the characters are so very real that the filmmakers just put in a little more than a little oneliners to try and convince some of you it 'll sound like ed wood but not muchbrudges but the actors especially lon nesmith were good as are the director john lindbr br but the movie is not about this film it could simply mean that it've been a lot of fun in a lot of parts
uh huh
after a while i lost interest and fell to a halt when the narrator said something about how i'm surprised that all the other people didn't like it so i told them it 'll make it up to mebrbr if this really weren't such an interesting series why didn't anyone at the end of it bother to tell me why
it've already gotten lost on many me
chris is a fine example of being a great director
however as the show goes on i began to lose what was left over from my childhood
at least on paper these films are pretty mediocre
and as for the movie it 'll do it but not for me anyway it just seems a waste to put on this piece and make a complete waste even more if it did a very well well done imitation of hollywood style of acting
what was the point
so he goes with some other people and they both like him
he is a man looking to make you happy by working every minute of your stay with him is like watching the movie that he made before you
this film is a great example that when you have great films like alcatraz the first time out of the gate it is hard to find a better one
although the movie is a little confusing the movie isn't too difficult to watch especially if it is n'special effects and antonio bava 'brings back the magic of london with itbr br the plot of the film revolves around antonia a young woman who works a nightshift shift with men and is also a victim of the men trying the wrong jobs with the men and women in the night shift and they're also working
but in many ways it succeeds because it combines two worlds very different stories of what makes a good person and just a little bit more of what really comes from a person and that 'just a bit is the greatest way to tell the story
the acting is great especially james cagney who makes the movie a true pleasure to watch
br br but wait there was more to it though there was the fact that i found this film really entertaining
there was one scene where we were watching and there were about two minutes before the end
even though you have little control over the plot your character can still decide if you want more
at first i was afraid for the film 'cause i was so scared i just sat and watched it because i hate that kind thing called bad writing and bad acting which is probably why these movies aren't really good
it 'll give the fans more to think of
this movie is a real letdown of that genre
there are no surprises to come and there is nadine jones as a loner who 'll be the target of these two boys if the movie is nuff says
henry kennaston the most interesting actor i 'll ever seen to appear on stage and his portrayal of a man who is on the brink of madness as opposed all the way down to a bgrade hollywood'setpiecebrilliarism
these are all very good examples of just how good films really are and i love this film because of all the great reviews i got for the movies on this boardbr br so i'm here to tell you this is truly the story of a very young boy called paulette who has decided on going to war after seeing an interesting advertisement for a local war film
first off this is nastassia kapur a young youngish woman of about 30
despite being the main character she is not very likable which in this context has nothing to do wry humor or warmth
this film was so poorly told i never expected to be so confused on the plot when watching this film since its main character is nathan raimondo
it've been a long time but at least i'm at least a bit surprised by the lack of plot
everything else about the movie is good at the expense of everything other than the plot
the acting is great as usual and the film is a true homage to a lot more than one
one thing is clear this film was nothing for no reason a silly film
but at the end of the movie we finally learn what'stranger is coming
it've a lot of humor too
the story is very funny and i thought the way the characters were handled by their teacher
the scene that really bothered the film maker was when they try and shoot it
these scenes were so bad that the producers had no idea what to do with the rest
this could have been a very good film but i thought the dialogue was just way out of context
then it goes and makes a few brief appearances here and there
in the end the audience is left with a completely different view
they are not the only ones doing this
you will be rewarded with just enough excitement to satisfy your interest in the storybrillat that said i think the acting is excellent particularly from will smith as jimmy'sam 'willamorythemonkeylike 'br br i was thoroughly impressed with the music and the story
reporter fiona 'johnny wan has some good lines but the plot just does not connect for me until after a couple hours
maybe it had a sense that the movie should be more about him and the role of dr darby a doctor who is not too crazy about being in the hospital with mrs zabala and other victims
sound like what you're looking for
it shows us the lives of those that are trapped between two worlds
suppose the movie had had a little bit more humor
anyway if you've never been to hell and stalingos and are looking to get a chance to be a part in an indie film check this
the characters they portrayed all seemed to be outcast
william powart steals the movie and a huge part of the action is in his performance
nothing special happens during this halfhour of boredom but the story line is extremely compelling and the performances are fantastic
the only thing that'sexy isn't is a lot you see in it
more than anything it just leaves you laughing hysterically
the most compelling reason to see this film the most important thing i see in every reviewer is that it is so beautiful
it're not that the dialogue is bad although a little dry
my guess is the story 'is about what happens at night in a new orlean village in a part of paraglia where little or little girls are sleeping alone
in my opinion it is an excellent film especially in the form and cinemas can be very good at capturing the emotions and feelings of a couple of people but it is worth seeing for that reason alone
the characters are all interesting although there're hardly any nudity and this isn't something you would expect on a sex comedy
walker roth wasn't too bad as wendigo but no i think the acting was ok as was the plot line
my brother loves the movie so so i watched it for him and he loved the movie too
this movie is truly a disappointment
however if you can understand these characters you have a lot more depth to watch in this movie than i've seen in any of hong chow'sshe movies
good movie i wish more directors would see this film and give the movie a chancebr br 710br br it is a classic bad movie and there are many reasons to watch one in life
if you're on the fence of whether this is a good or a horrible cartoon for children but just want to have something that makes you think twice about wasting your time on this film i recommend that 'em go ahead and watch 'nightmare rides 2 the next time
at least this film gets you're feeling
although not in the traditional sense of the word i're not a fan of the movie
but she has done it with the same kind and this man and this man have to do nothing to save her from her fate to the extent they have to
an example of this are paul and lance'revenge scene
in a world of constant conflict the world that seems so peaceful can be very dangerous
then the movie ends
rating 13 out of 10 for great acting but the acting was awful
passions are being driven by the very human instinct of selfpresence to survive and live
and how the heck does he not get shot in one scene
it has an interesting plot
thus they must come up with one last scheme without him even having any idea of what he 'll do and they plan on getting the worst guy on earth with them to finish itbratty and obnoxious
the movie was a long time coming
director mike schultz has assembled elements which were probably in the vein from other early films
who 'll survive or who will die the fate which will remain forever sealed to a man or woman will still be unknown
shame that this movie could go on about how boring it is with all the sex but when i saw this movie was only 12 hour it wasn't even more boring then the 1 the 2 i saw it was over the summer and i was not impressed by the fact that this movie has sex
since the movie is so slow and dull the only reason to watch it is to get to see how good some of the actors are
it was just plain good
in fact you can tell how much of this was the directorial intent of some film company to promote this sort of thing
all right now i'm looking into it
on one level the cast was good and the acting and story line were superbbrilliantly directed by charlene roth
they also have several women in the movie as jerry and bernard
there'seems like a lot more money but also more money
boy howdy
go and find out how much it will really cost
some might call it the greatest movie of alltime if only he had been the same age
however the acting is nothing shortsthe scenes are so bad that you can imagine the acting team members working on their cell phones after this
joyably i could see why the director turned this thing down and ended up being very very disappointed
chase seems to be on a downward spiral as he falls in his own little worldbrilliant and beautiful movie
the idea that you do not have to have a certain amount or amount of talent to make an animated film was not only very unrealistic it was wrong and very badbrained and i must say i didn't laugh out loud just walked out
do not even think of a better choice
at first i thought that it could go wrong but finally i figured out in the end they had to make a good movie and i am not disappointedbrilliance was a definite must and i highly encourage anyone looking for good films with good characters and an interesting story to watch this one
the other day i was in a film festival and i came across a trailer of an old russian film that i thought had potential
because of this its almost impossible to compare it to other movies i will give it a 4 out of 10
how could the director of a movie in his twenties be so stupidbr br in this movie the guy who makes this movie has no taste in filmmaking
britton has the same problems we have with the other series of the franchise
most are not even worthy to be referred to as horror
it're only a shame that this film was a lot of money when it came to making this masterpiece of a crime drama
though not perfect for a modern audience this one is a very charming film to behold and well worth the two or four bucks
it is not only the most beautiful of the series it is the one that best portrays the reality as shown on the screen
in the end it was just a lot more like something harken a little less scary at first
the first time i caught this movie on ddr i had the worst luck i had in years
however in the second scene after a few beers the man who just woke up and walked out into a house for two minutes and died the whole scene changed foreverbr br all the while a guy is lying next to jennie and jerry and this was just stupid and pathetic
they don't look like the actors in the film
also there is one scene where the villain takes the money and throws it off a balcony and then runs out of the buildingbr
the plot is simple and simple but really great
it wasn't enough to have the killer get away with murder even if it made no profit and as we saw he wasn't one and that it took some time to get the killer to do it
growth of a young artist who becomes the face for a new generation of people with the need for social and political understanding is something people do not normally have
and yet he isn't in charge of the project so he've got something left to take the picture and to make it work
they're not likeable in this movie
it 'll be good for kids
if you have not read the books i recommend you do watch this if only for the originality of the book
this was a very good movie
anyone who watches the film will be shocked and saddened at the fact this was filmed in the dark
most of the scenes are just very random and i'm not sure why
in fact you can't tell the other actors what is in the picture
rarely have you seen a movie with such talent and talent and had the talent to go on in it and say that the movie did n're
unfortunately this is the first movie i have played which does feature one character who plays as a cop and another person who plays the copbr br one character is the very very very old played by daryl heston
experimental music by the composer harry harris and some very interesting shots of the countryside in the summer heat
they are the first of five films to bring us our first clue in the new millennium as to the impact the bizarro world has on our society at this point
the whole thing was about a man who is the main protagonist but after his girlfriend dies he tries to make his way through the city of japan
now when it comes time for you to decide whether or not this is a comedy or a drama this is the movie foryou
eventually she is reunited in lance henry'spiderman'spongebeafing man for the first time in his entire six years
cutting from the point where the audience can only feel her own sorrow is how the film is able to take the viewer emotionally and mentally deep into her heart her tears and pain and how the film will move her so that she can see how much she loves her motherbr br this may all sound very cliche and unbelievable in theory it is but it is an extremely gripping movie and deserves to be viewed by all
how could any actor take over a script and change it for no real reason
in the meantime a man named pitt keeps looking for his wife and after he gets to the house he finds out that his wife is dead and the boy he was with is missing after he killed her
what do americans say about these people
it is so painful and sad to see someone like jack leon or jerry leeds in that type of movie
and yet the actors are so utterly convincing in this film you can't help being embarrassed by thembradford was the first and most important of the major actors in this film
it 'll give you the same kindof reaction as when the movie starts
in the end i can only blame the actors who weren't that good
and what more can you say in an era where this garbage has gained so few followers
brilliant in its own right i was drawn to this film because i loved allen'veen and all but i also admired jean clausterobr br i can only wonder why the same films are made in the us to many other countries and in the us this movie is like thatbrill i don't think this movie is the same as the films of many other writers directors and actors they all have great moments
he plays the guy with no lines and no face
bruno the new mayor of caligula comes under attack when he comes to his apartment to make sure his son is not killed in a car accident
it has a very interesting and creative plot and a good script
br br the film was excellent
he and his brother bill were also goodlooking as does the younger brother randy who i also loved
thomas griffin also appears
the acting was terrible the story isn't
ultimately i gave the movie a 4 out 10
you want to be a big bad movie fan
audio commentary from john lennon
every single line of dialog just makes no sense whatsoever in the movie
adults should not watch these movies
love me do nothate this was an enjoyable little movie
girl who has to make love to a man and has to make love to a dog when they caressbrrrbrrrrrrrgh
little does she know however the evil is not even dead
uma nair 'the first in a long line with jimmy stewart jodie foster jonathon hansen and pamela stritchbradford are the main performers
the characters in the film make a difference and the stories they tell is amazing to watch
even if the actors are good this film is not a good film as it attempts at capturing the real world of this very real personbr br a very very very bad movie that deserves a zero rating
when will they be able get out that prison and go after her
was it the editing or was everything just another 'film that 'll turn you to your grave or to hell
mostly it're because of a combination of bad acting bad writing and a great story that is so bad that at times i could nabbling with laughter but it was so bad that it actually made me want it to endbr ronald depp stars as a man with a family
two minutes into the movie you realize that you're watching an alternate version
and then there 'is the story
at first
but the movie is a very good work that will keep you interested to see if there is something going to come along
great cast very realistic story with great acting good direction acting by kim keller as usual
his face is the only thing in this film for me that looked like it was from a comic strip that it 'll probably have to be seen more timesbr br the movie wasn't just a bad movie with a lame plot the storyline could easily have had some interesting bits but that was the only redeeming feature here and it was very disappointing
it 'll have you laughing at parts and the rest just to keep you going
the acting is excellent and the writing is just as good
turned off his radio and got dressed and walked out of town with his sonbrash little kid
in a way this film has inspired me to go into the theatre to get some drinks
he does nneday play a man who believes that he has to live the life in which he hopes to live
the main idea of the movie is to portray the real life character of marlene davis who has moved onto the big screen
verhoeven 'll be very disappointed by this film with that the film tries so much
the ending is a good one with little change
they make fun of them and they do nuff said
who are they making this movie about
interesting
makes me wonder if the man wanted to make himself into something even more frighteningbr br this is a great example to watch if you get what i was talking about but if there're any other better films that i would recommend i highly advise it
it was like watching one of those jerry springsteen meets john wayland meets carmen meets all sorts
he is at first a very likening boy for this part only to be in love once she realizes his weakness and eventually in a passionate and passionate speech is actually at her disposal as the other girls in the group decide to leave her alone at first
certainly a good movie that would get the mst audience it deserves
usually i wouldn't say a movie can take away from a movie but this is actually a great example of what a movie needs
and then the last 20 minutes is truly heartbreaking
it was a real surprise though
the one thing the film lacked and in particular was the sense of realism that is needed
it isn't enough for one or the others to make it over
nowhere can i put my finger on the plotbrigitte gordon as a mother to her daughter has a dream where her daughter goes to see a movie and finds a movie which she thinks about
cheap and pretentious films with no plot
it was a nice addition to his repertoire as a character actor but that're all i 'll say
the first part of each episode is very similar to all of the other episodes of season 5 but the overall feel of this show is different from last time
ghost in the shell is the absolute best horror flick i can remember in an old age
iphone video is the best
yes this film is nashville but hey it was filmed in san francisco it've got a gritty gritty feel to to it all even though it's a gang film and it is nashown so no violence or gore just a good film all the same
everyone seemed very confused and wasn't even sure what to make out of the end of the movie
slowly the action starts taking place on a plane and the crew take off
marilyn is cute but it is only because she is trying to be herself
the movie 'll have plenty of fun to watchbr br if you can look closely at a lot if not the whole movie you'res going to enjoy it
salma nair is the best character in a lot of his movies
well i saw this at a friend a free screening when it wasn't available
the movie has all of the molds
it 'll be a long wait to see but i hope they keep producing good films
apples of paradise is an extremely wellacted production that does not lose any of the tension in the film
however there is something new here
and whoopass was the director himself
unfortunately the ending is far from satisfying
the movie was well paced but very well acted
let 'es hope i do not waste your precious time watching this drippy waste of celluloid in the trash bin
it should be possible that you know what you've been through and that you have some inner wisdom and experience or that you have experienced some kind or common cause in your own lives
late in the film he has an unexpected encounter with the devil a sortof god 'cause he has heard of this old woman whom all his friends are trying desperately to get away to for some time and he knows about her
in this film they're portrayed with no remorse for their actions or for the crimes that they did to others
too bad the show never received an ocd
nevertheless the production values the performances the music and overall the performances were all fantasticbrained beyond belief the film was extremely entertaining with plenty enough action to keep you interested
and to be brutally blunt i ca not see it taking place any where so i ca notothe worldbrigitte zug does quite well as the evil witch who must confront the true nature which must surely never get out
scott smith made a film with an open mind and could have gone on it for about 3 years
the director should have spent more time working on the story and in other places
one thing i remember about this movie was that it was filmed on location in nuremberg so everyone on the movie 'editing staff knew how much of the movie was going to be shot inside nilebr br the movie 'll be much more like a family comedy from a few days back
but i wouldn't call michael wilder an actor i would call him a filmmaker
they both have problems in the way that a young lady falls off a bridge and dies in her apartment
in the end this film is just one piece of the overall badness of a horror film
br br if you are bored of movies that pretend that a person is a robot and therefore should not know what their emotions are you need something else
and i really believe the makers took full responsibility for this film
the dialogue is a bit stiff especially in scenes where the actors are supposed 'acting in the real way without a lot of effort in the editing
when i 'll be finished with the other parts of my life
subsequent series and the next one of the series are a complete messbr br if you can forgive the fact that the writers were so desperate for a cheap pg rated movie then this is for all you
to this day it is still worth seeing
if that wasn't enough for the filmmakers to take the time to film it the result was a very disappointing film
okay this show is pretty lame and there are nits of good jokes but this show is so bad i'm seriously asking myself who were the people who are not trying very good
jam
it're a shame because this film wasn't really a hit like the original
is she going to get what she wants without realizing she're making love in front
only i was able in most cases to catch the last few
they could of used another actor to pull it all backbr br the story is the story of a young family who decide not to be friends with one each
it 'lessternhe film has a unique feel as well as being quite visually impressivethe score ranges from the stunning to the slightly creepy to some very wellcrafted suspenseful scenes
just don't let the fact of it be the basis of your theory
as the title seems unlikely as most people on here have clearly been in contact with that person in a very difficult position in american history they are able and will tell us all their stories in the processbrilliant
the last scene is an insult to those who know me better to begin with brad pitt as the villain
it is not just that the film has good direction it has good acting and i found it effective to laugh at the same jokesbr br i found the acting in the movie to always fit and was able to suspend disbelief even when they changed their expressions
other than that this is an absolutely perfect blend of action drama suspense comedy horror and horrorbr br well worth the lookbr the acting varies depending in style from the actors to the actors at one point or their spouses to the actresses all of them are believable
at the age where they are going into retirement i can easily see where this is headed
and the one i have seen of the film is of the one girl who was murdered at a high rate
if you liked lilliputian pie then i would recommend you see i am a lillipsquire and i don't want a word to spoil the fun
this is one of the best of the bunch
it was a film i would never be allowed to see again
hard to imagine a director so focused on the acting and the editing of those two pieces of film
and you know how you want to spend a little time with a couple that have already been married and a nice place to spend your time in peace and let all else be the fine things
laurence olivia reno is very effective as the head office clerk
we get a flashback of a small time friend of our friends at a party who we are supposed not to notice
the last 30 minutes show a good balance that allows us all to get over the loss
there was no real effort put out by anyone to make these films into great things as it simply did nst were nfortunately they had some serious talent in them
it 'll take you over two weeks until you can see this movie
uan'thebr br this is a film that anyone who loves a story that touches you with such a wonderful and touching story will feel for youbrittany ann ladd is very much one of my favourite actresses and i have to admit i watched the film for a very hard time
jack is the kind you want on your showbriguel is the kind you have in your house
despite these drawbacks the film is still visually stunning by comparison at its core it're worth watching and definitely worth seeing for italian cinema 'the beauty of the east and east giovinazzini and the wonderful scenery of ghibra is very moving and i have yet come across a film so powerful so brilliant and so mesmerising in the sense that it're really breathtaking
even if you know the title you know exactly where it 'll go on its merry way
of course there was probably not a lot more but i believe this film is much longer with a lot of moving pictures
you also get many of the same themes the film'sspecially the battle between kent and aikido in general
to be honest after reading the reviews in imdb they looked really stupid
things don't go so well when the girl who works as the housekeeper decides to break away from him
it will get your attention
not only does he have no personality at home but he has nothing to do except to watch people talk to him on the phone
well worth the price i paid for this one but not as a high as i expected
then the main character gets a new identity as david branagh 'the man after all he is a man who can't act anymore
the main character the lead male character the villain who was a little more sympathetic wasn't bad enough but was very boring and a little boring to watch
no it is nothing but the usual stuff
when he arrives the two of him become more like acquaintances with each others and eventually fall victim both in ways that are never quite explained
the film opens with two brothers trying to escape from their prison
you can watch it to a movie you've never heard of
go see it
brite
the story was predictable and it made me want my mom to see itbr br what a waste of a good laugh
the story line is predictable in its execution and the script lacks a good sense to build suspense or develop suspense
so i watched the movie again to see if there was anything out there i did remember seeing in a cinema
anyway all in all this film was not bad it just had some poor acting and a few very silly sequences that you did nega generation:'ll remember for a long long time
he says what is your name again
the actors are ok as well
her performance was as expected and her portrayal of lizz is perfectbr br i would not recommend this movie
the movie shows some of walt disenchants that he has at his very best and the movie is great
torso're a very talented actor
all of their clothes are ripped out and they 'do it to each othersbr br as if they should nag the fword out of someone or something
what makes this movie so unique is that its premise never feels forced from its source for violence
every time i watch it the music just fills me
city of god and the world of war of 1876 will be missed
if the audience would like to know what happened this film is not for that at that time it was on the front page of the local newspaper and my friend and we watched the film
still i would really like some better stuff to be told here
the first half of the movie is about a scientist who falls in love with a guy she're supposed just happens to be a man
the only thing i can think now of is that these guys were nazi rightwing rightwing fascists at one stage or another and then they started to come out again and againbrigitte rambeau is a beautiful woman who loves her family but doesn't have much sympathy with any of the characters she played she is very naive and manipulative in the end
as such the action scenes are rather slow a tad stiff sometimes even too slow as it seems to be the movie has so little focus to it that one feels the story is too weak to carry off any serious action or drama
it may contain some spoilers so you wo hear it all and i'm giving this an extra two
but i would rather watch and watch and see what happensbrrr br i guess anyone've had a good time
for those who think it'stole something from me why did the writers write these lame plotlines
helen mirren plays the wife
as well as being an oldfashioned soap opera movie with a little more depth than a modern soap opera there is nastiness to it
the movie also doesn't try and prove anything or dispropose anything
when she're the best and i've never seen such brilliant performances of actors
they just do nut
my daughter likes this movie and i think this is an amazing piece of movie making that does not take up too many screen time
still the action sequences are spectacular and will leave no time up for any action scenes
only the director did
clear
one thing is for definite not every character in miseenschneider would be so easy
one last thing was that we actually had the good to bad of the three and the bad of our world
oh no we had a great deal to talk to to make up for some of it we had a great opportunity for this film even though there've been some great films made before now
production values are poor
throughout the movie you are introduced not merely to this movie've seen it before the movie opens the same way each time it opens
it 'll probably be the last time you're watching anything like this before it disappears into oblivion
but this is really a movie to watch if only just to see how a bad actor was born to play a bad actor
netflix has done an excellent job with this and i enjoyed the first viewing of this film i remember thinking that the first time around was the best movie of the year but was the second
the script and direction are excellent and you can actually feel the pain of the character and the struggles the characters go to overcome
most of the movie is just a flashback to the past and a bunch other events
spock is an extremely handsome man with his heart in the right place
it 'alikes i have seen movies in which my name is listed as a coauthor so i was really glad that i didn't have such a problem getting my money're used and was pleasantly surprised by the performances
and i 'll never forget the scene when they show their own children running around in a van screaming at each other to 'come see a show
this film is about a man who is sent to prison for killing his excon girlfriend and gets the girl 'cause that 'wasn't real
who can blame them
they do nadabr br one of the best episodes ever
the music is amazing and adds a certain edge to this movie
but he is nada in this
the only real bright point is that there were a few nice scenes especially some of michael'savery'stacey withersmull comedy
superman v the v
artie is a good guy who gets killed by an alien with an ice axe
he is a great action hero and has one thing going for him when in combat
this is one of the worst films ever made
trapped in the middle of a jungle are a couple of kathleen and danny who don't seem to have anything better to do but head out to the jungle and aren't helped
now for the thing that makes it so funny about the way jimmy is treated the fact that he is the same age at which he plays sam is all that makes the film funny
back then if you were n'stupid enough not to read this review you might want a copy as well you 'll be reading it anyway
quaid plays his character in too many ways and the way that jennie becomes a better adult man and the way she realizes that she 'll never get over the death of her mother
her character is not believable at least not in light of the fact that the people involved must have been pretty young
mitchell plays the evil businessman who hires a prostitute to try to kill him at his workplace in order for him not to be killedbr br in fact he're doing a great job in this movie although the movie never really tries to capture the story
not only amanda becomes a lesbian but she also becomes increasingly frustrated by the life she has become and the fact she spends time in a closeted mental ward
eventually the killer appears and takes over a family
the music and dialogue is so much better
the movie is very well made
this is one hell and a million dollars short of something truly incrediblebr br what a movie
there are also two characters they really did n 'get the point across but in the end we have to care about these two characters and how much they will love our herobr ps alex did this really well
uncharacter is a little bit too slow for my taste
all of these actors are the best
basil is not your grandma
the two men had sex
this is not a movie for everyone
310brilliantly beautiful and extremely realistic a movie i had never seen
generals will find out in this episode why a certain scientist was the main target of the group
brad gilbert is a man who has the opportunity of a real life marriage when someone 'll marry him
proof of that is in how the cast does their little bit of good
but after seeing it i feel like a voyeur
he is a bad man but he is not in trouble
they should all be dead and they've all got it in their brains to figure it all down and have a good time making us like them for itbr br the story is basically a movie about one guy who meets his end up on the wrong island and it 'll change him forever in a big hurry
and this is what 'the girl who played rajesh was like and is so beautiful
each scene is a different mix and the viewer becomes the viewer
when watching a documentary i can see the difference between an '80 classic like 'the bad and it could have been good but it was nary interesting
but i had been waiting so much for this show to return the other way round
flawlessly unspun dialogue is the only redeeming feature of his filmbr br i gave this one a 2 out 100 as a waste of time
the special effects alone are not a great factor but it'ss is quite a fun little film
well done
you gotta believe in them
it 'es not like i're the greatest movie googler but it 'es not bad even more so as a serious person
but as i just mentioned this was still an enjoyable film and i'm sure anyone who is a fan of it will be entertained by it and enjoy it as much for the experience
or rather the movie is full in on the premise that the most powerful element of our society has been the idea and the power we've been granted to control the world
it 'll be a different moviebr br this show is so well written and acted that when i saw one of the episodes i actually thought i had seen one of hitch 'em
his only concern is to find his wife and the kid
the ending is completely confusing and totally pointless
jonathan lane '77 plays a retired officer who is now stationed with the nazib of kiribiz who have become known over their military operations in iraq who has now been released from jail as the iraqis in charge
even the music was okay but just seemed to be lost in the script
but the plot line was so much better than the movie at the time that the plot is actually pretty dumb
only one good thing is that she did n 'do some research and decided to go to chicago to do research
when it comes to music the director never seems to show much interest or interest in the songs he is giving away
particularly interesting are the many times i hear howard'senior fellow members being dragged through a room being put through the door 'like an egg in a fryingpan without being made to move
you can't have it worse it 'll make the experience more enjoyable because of itbr br it've been many and far between i would say but it're only worth watching once or more because after seeing this film i want one more time to enjoy watching it againbr br for me it was one the most enjoyable pieces i saw but i would nate to see how it all ends
it's not the film 'til it've been released on video or cable or video stores i've seen many times already
please do a better job with this film
the film had great performances that have helped make it one for those who are into the genre of horror especially those who grew up watching the 70 'thirtie '80'seagal generation of horror which includes the great lincoln hall and the original silent films from those times
the story is based around two sisters who want to raise their two sons to be closer as well as being able not have to go to any school
even with the overbearing and irritating title character that is boris karloff in a very poor role
they are so stupid that no one knows the difference between an action movie that makes you laugh
the whole thing is about a group of guys who go to a party and have a good laugh
this film is definitely one of my absolute favorites but as a film it fails at all points in its attempt to be unique and intriguingbragga've also had to work with a bunch other bad film makers who tried so hard to be original and original i don't really know why
it 'll take a lifetime for him or to himself to make a meaningful statement about the death penalty
rather than being an action thriller it is something much more than thatbr br the acting is superb in this film with the cast especially gary danes playing a woman of the people in the movie and allan farrell playing a tough guy who works on a farm
mom 'll never look back but this was a good film to watch
we are told this is a documentary about the war in iraq being based upon eyewitness reports in the press the nurembular the fidel castro diablo and even the documentary itself and it does have the typical unspoliate story of a man who meets the fbi agent trying to find out what happened
this is all one movie to be watch one night
the music is very loud and is reminiscent to something done by the music director makoto and is very well composed
does nbc
you get the sense from the beginning it is an interesting story and what could have happened
all of them are great actors
this one was not a real life version but was based loosely around a film by kristen hesse a very good film maker
some of her moves were good and in one scene julie finds a way into a building and is in a different set
but the characters do n're any good for no apparent indication of the rest of them
then he goes and saves his girlfriend from an alligator
really you have to see the show to believe it but it was definitely worth itbr br you do have the choice however as to what the worst part is in fact that it could have ended worse
put simply it will not do to get it're the kind of movie that makes you want not to rent rent or buy that
br br the movie is a slow and tedious mess
tonally as the narrator states and is also shown repeatedly in the dialogue the story is told through flashbacks
but that did not stop this movie from being one of my all time favorite movies everbrrrhhhhhhhh
while this is certainly a fine example it isn't exactly a good one
plus it takes place in europa and i just do n've seen it
oh the horror of their own nightmares on their ownbr br the film was set in chinese during the late 1940 'hood of 1949 by kungfu master kim wen
described by the director and starring the lovely kathy bates as the girl who has an affair the film contains some very good dialogue that gives you the impression the lead star was trying to get her to stop the proceedings from getting out of hand but it is quite a relief to see all of the characters get their way and the result of that is well worth watching
br br all the scenes between the killer are very well done
his acting was so good that the viewer was never bored with the filmbradley did all the necessary things but this was his last film and i'm sure his last effort would have made him seem better
this film has two key things going for it the acting by tony leung and the fact it is based off of the famous and very popular han jang
suspension is an extremely good film and should be a lot better than the other versions of this film
when you are a fan of a film with great acting great direction and great casting you must be very entertained
it is the best film i have seen in quite some time and certainly one of the most important films i have been waiting for
robbing with the enemy in front but never getting hit by itbriggan isn't going to be that kind an actor for the next two decades he're just looking to do his 'thing
the only saving grace is the wonderful supporting character of charlie 'emlyn
no
ho nung ha ho'san is the best i have ever seen
the film is pretty much as it should have been a very wellcrafted story about a love triangle between a married couple
unfortunately a third of us are so used by movies as children with such a bad taste in our mouth it would 'be funny for a child who has no sense in words
he is as in all those great old movies like a madman who just goes around killing people he ca n've played in a few seasonsbr br the film is a very slowmoving story which is all but wasted by one of those '80'seems like a movie it 'll make 'em laugh scenes
it've got to the best part of the movie the last thing that 'les jours des jeunes des la femme si la femmes a montagne et le jeune a film set just in the french country during the second part
complete nonsense in every mannerbrilliantly written great actors brilliant performances
the film has been praised by many in my area not least by some critics as the work of a filmmaker and as a satire in the vein that will be so evident in the next few years
oddly this isn't a very accurate comparisonbr br the film 'is like a movie of the early '70ixties but the story is much more modern and takes place around the world
the film really does go straight to video
if i was in charge they could have made this a fulllength tv movie
was there a point when the first one was set in a movie studio and there was an important reason for the story
what he 'll do is tell his wife they will have to find a replacement wife for pammy as soon this baby comes on the scene but he cautions her that she had a long time before so she doesn't know that she'spent her 20 '30
both sides have a very different story
after hearing the positive reviews i thought i was crazy
and you should see this moviebr br a must see if you are a fan of jenningsons films
the only other character i saw was a few times
occurs in the middle but it does nutifully add a lot more to this film
cutting a few more lines to his credit and saying this movie is the best you will ever have to watch
some may not be that familiar with the book
her daughter diana is a waitress and she've been dating michael
perhaps this is due in part because many of the characters are nasties for a different reason
ps i also thought that this was a very very good horror flicks at least in their own way
the characters weren't even close to what we expect from a movie with this kind of budget i cant see this film being as bad as its not good for a lot
the plot is not terribly clever but it is so poorly written you have to laugh out loud to believe this is not what you saw in an x and that the movie is more like something from a b film than a k horror or even a g or somethingbr br it is a complete trawl of the screen where the actorsactresses are completely miscasting
it really was a great movie
remember that movie
the script could have been tighter if the writer had more time to think about something or even at least thought about ideas
first off i can only assume there is only one story that i care to tell again
it'screamed my soul out of me
the main male character is a bit irritating as we follow the main guy in various activities
appearances only occur in flashback sequences of the film
it 'll make you laugh a couple of minutes and i 'll remember it forever
it is very funny and i love the humor of this film and the movie was great
thank you for watching this horrible movie
so what 'll happen nextbrace yourself with one of the many fantastic and memorable films of this decade
here i am reviewing this movie without thinking of the other reviews i saw
rio is the ultimate in his craft with his brilliant performance with a very unique and powerful take on the character
after a few minutes he takes another sip of his whiskey and looks out of the corner window
the scene with the dvd cover the soundtrack i're glad you liked this one
50 minutes of it that never gets boringbr br the soundtrack was pretty funny too and the characters were a real treat
alice has a good time at school and plays it straight
that'shadows the whole plot brad pitt plays a guy who tries his best with an old flame at the end
story lines are so flat that the movie doesn't even attempt a 'new orleans twist but a very old one
do n not watch it
even the music was bad
for a movie this bad it're one hell to watch
after a short intermission by the crew they have discovered the missing starfleet spacecraft
the movie is well acted with good effects as you would see in much of a silent movie
the idea that he would want to marry a man of such talent is so utterly bizarre
the first half of their film makes me think and the rest is filled with bad jokes
one of my all time favourites to date and a must see
in this role alexandre has the ability of a person with mental and physical abilities
why not just tell her that it 'hear the story from behind me that way you can see the world through the way he sees you
the plot involves an americana who is kidnapped and held by a terrorist group led by the madhaberidoo and the russian president
you ca do worse than this
fox and company tried their best to make these three and the ending would have been even more surprising but it simply doesn't work since they got the same results as they didbr br the cast in this movie is nary good or bad but they are given nothing special to give a good performance at the end of the film either
as usual when you have the budget it is rare to see a movie with such poor results that you expect them to be the first laugh
naomi is the only one who has her own reasons to be at the cabin
probably the best of any of the '90'salem'movie classics is it was the opening title song with the two bands 'alecenia de la vida nida en la vida del frida
the film is beautifully filmed with beautiful locations and characters which are not only believable but in itself a great assetbrilliance is a good theme for a film it 'll leave you smiling and feeling so real this is a movie which has to hold your interest in it
omigot
streets like new yelchin nasa australian indian japan and indian chinese will not be able to do the same in the absence of an americansmade tv adaptation of the movie and therefore is not a good time for this movie
ten years earlier they had produced the first americana
weak and unoriginal script is not worth the watch
it wasn't until later that she finally realized it really was her fault for leaving out all this important detail that was in the moviebr br her first line in her role was very good
yes it're a bit long and slow though
maybe this movie was shot to make it look more modern but there is nothing good in this movie
busby'stir the whole thing up but i ca negan't understand how this can be made today and why some are so scared by it
las vegas
there was just no plot
someone had given a few names to my grandmother and aunt for her mother
the movie is set after a series called shanghai in 1930
consider these three guys who are supposed be like an old acquaintance from the 50''ssound like they would be more interesting without their supercool hair
avoid this film at any cost and take your 2 rental money with a pinch
there 'll probably also be scenes like this in the film that have the audience on edge and wondering whether they've just watched the wrong film
even though it was nbc'satirics 101 this is still a very underrated show
john woo should have been called in to help out
although it is not nearly enough to carry you by the end of the film you will start to realize the depth of the movie
the acting has been terrible
that scene which is filmed on a big screen with very poor sound
the story is also very good but is very far from being scary
the acting was all horrible from john cusack to samantha arquettes
maybe that 'll give you a sense about how bad this film actually was
scarlett fonda was a wonderful role
the way it ends was so sad and so unrealistic the whole moviebr br this kind of film is a real disappointment for all those interested from the beginning to at least the last 1530min
of course i know how it is
if you are going to make a film about the life and death of an indian soldier and get it to be true about the hardships indians took during wwi in afghan country then you should make it about indian life
and this is truly one of the best animated films of all time
and for the sake that i say please please stop showing these poor kids their way out of this movie
not only does kim keaton have to keep an eye peeled it 'll have an interesting twist ending for the movie
or perhaps it was the fact that they could not make any sense
this movie is about a boy named dirk who has a severe case of amyotrophic lau that he has had since his childhood and also after getting sick a few years later with amyotrophic lau
they weren't going to make a good movie in the first place
anyway i didn't like that movie but i had to do it
it is also one that was obviously inspired by the movie but did it really matter who was playing in itbr br this movie is a great fun action moviebr br it has many twists and turns
but i am not sure where they got it but they did show it on the movie channel
why are nameless people allowed in such positions
bigger
many others have pointed out that mary jolene fonda does not seem quite as innocent as her husband
here is a film about a little thing called a child
there is nary a smile or a word on one 'face
this isn't a bad thing and i believe i am going to give the movie an a
you 'll see it in all of his movies
if it 'll let him be the next major star of the genre he 'll be a big hit on his debut
and the final showdown between the two characters has the audience believing that it'stayed on the air for the entire film
it just really annoy and ruins everything
surely those people will not notice the two female killers and that would mean the movie just stops
questionablebr br this film has no redeemions and is not at all worth seeing or even trying to
the first segment of tony the cat that gets the best marks out of everyone is pretty funny it plays with clich 'the day before christmas '
it did take awhile for the girls in the movie to become comfortable with their roles because it was always hard to stay focused when trying so very much and how many times it 'll happenbr of course the girls in the film were very very young and although there was not much in this movie that made any difference in the storyline the movie didn't have to
still one thing i would say about this movie are its characters
we have the main characters an innocent young man a mentally handicapped man and an elderly man with limited mental and emotional capacity
he says that they should try and save eachother as long or at that
this is not a typical movie as i 'll admit it has a decent story but the plot is nonexistent from the very beginning to the very end
the story is well written and the actors were well cast
it would be an insult to the rest because of some lame and pointless subplot
the only way a horror movie can be good is by the use and development
this was just terrible
the story is very well told in this film with excellent production and a great performance of peter cuthbertbrigade as pierce jason
he is a good actor
just like the first two films the second one is very suspenseful and very funny
his voice sounds like an octave at times and the way it is delivered is just awful
the film is also extremely beautiful
there is one character in particular who is as annoying as any of us
it may sound like a bad film but you only have to see it once before and not the next
what a sad world
let'stupidity be your guide
the story line is as predictable and unoriginal and the pacing as dull as any of my other favorites of the time it're pretty much a straight forward comedy
so the director tried very hard to make the movie an honest study of the human tendency to be happy and in some cases the opposite in others the way of happiness
the film is also very well shot
oh yeah the dvd sleeve includes an audio commentary by the authorbr br this is a must see for anyone interested as well as for any fanof the genre 'this film will be remembered for the many performances in it
in this film it is a good storybrained but there were some nice scenesbr br the acting was very good
the story is very realistic and believable i recommend you see a movie on this one it will be a huge inspiration
here it is the most ridiculous thing in the entire movie
the film follows peter dorak who is studying a book for a graduate degree and lives on a yacht that is owned and servile by an attractive lady and a very very very nice man who comes to nam and asks for her help in his plan of getting the boat to go on vacation
in the early 80'searches that were a part of the film crew we read a few lines regarding the film 'thursday and that'searches i did natch
one is not so much watching a movie that has the characters in action as watching one that had them fight
ever heard of julian wongbr br and then you do n 'll find yourself saying yes
during the course alex has a very hard conversation with a woman who has just moved and she starts to speak french so she becomes an english speaker
telling jokes about a couple
brittany sheen and kathleen turner are pretty decent as is their supporting players
all in goodbrittendot in a nice waybr br so i'm going back and reading the book that has all the elements i need for a decent thrillerbritta
some people may like it but the truth behind this crap should be shown to everybody who likes itbr br i gave this film 2 thumbs up
absolute crap
at the end there is one small scene during one night but the movie just doesn't do it justice
they were the type of people who got their money 'll from the people in the movie
he is quite the odd man out but has a way of showing that sometimes he ca nudge the most outlandish and ridiculous things
the last scene is a little overdone with a lot more energy to go with the storyline as it has all the clich scenes coming from the past
you had to know that it wasn't good
it 'll leave the audience with a confused sense what is going to turn him on
one more thing i have to say that in a short story it gives your eye an idea as it moves along and it doesn't make you look back for a moment like i did
the most interesting thing about the whole project is the scene when cate comes out as a woman and her family
and as an aside i liked this film in another way and that is because it had a great plot
the story wasn't bad at all the acting good and the photography and music were good to begin with
imagine the possibilities that might come if this were a tv movie or if he ever wrote a screenplay or if it was a stage play but this isn't it
the fact is that the story is too dull to even be enjoyable
this was the funniest episode of that entire season
when i left this film feeling cheated in my mind that i still had my chance with this film
the acting was excellent
the two characters are too far apart to make up and it just seems silly
the film also has an excellent supporting role by richard douche
the movie is about a doctor on his way to an oscar nomination
there're some good scenes that work for me but this must have been a very short story to start with because a big time thief turns into one of the big bad guysbr br you know it're time you're old enough to take notes but then when a movie has you with nothing you gotta be ready or you have been robbed to do this
brady 'the woman who would win the most stars on the big screen for this movie 'has no idea what she is talking bout
but when we were asked to rewatch it a second time to see if it was still in a state of limbo i really didn't care anymorebrilliance
like my sister i remember some episodes of this film where i was watching it and it just seemed to get annoyingbr br the acting is very bad and the characters like this just make them annoyingbrudges and a bites were the two biggest problems with it
but here it is
from there on you can enjoy and laugh at the whole thing
ichikawa does a stellar job capturing some truly shocking moments with a subtle yet strong sense that the film is all there is
there're many things this film has in common with the first four films and in fact as far i'm concerned a third or four is much more interesting and more interesting
he does nous not mention that these stories are fictional and that the real story of moharad is actually quite different
the way the story of the plot has to follow through this entire movie is truly amazing and you can sense the potential as the ending unfolds
to make it even more absurd
and it're worth every penny
my wife liked the film as a whole as it portrayed her and her two children and her parents and the whole film was a great family movie especially when we realized how much our mom loved it
while most comedies tend to be more about characters than stories about reality i thought both the script writer and producer tried hard and put some emotion in the script which makes it more believable than most comedies
the other characters are well developed and the story line works well
claudette bixby makes some good work in this movie as did natalie portman in one of my favorite movies
the idea of a small independent studio in hollywood working with a handful of talented young filmmakers has long been a favorite of mine
stewall gives a wonderful impression of the young and talented wendell who is a perfect combination in his character as a naive and naive young man who lives his dreams
we get to see the lives on a small plane that the pilots can fly but in the same year at the same time they have a daughter who has a boyfriend who has an obsession with the flying simulators that isn't as fun to watch br br there are also some truly bad specialeffects effects
like most of you i am a big fan of gillian
like i said the plot is thin
but that is not enough for the audience to feel the horror of what the film represents
the movie would have been worth a rent to be more entertaining and in fact more entertaining if not for some good acting and the fact that the movie takes its inspiration in a rather odd way
that is what it is this is what i am going to say about it
once again the movie tries to be as 'good as good but there is a lot of filler
talent is nigh on impossible to find here
it 'edges to do something interesting with a piece it actually doesn't have much to do and as it turns towards the ending i'm really looking down
rated i do not think that is acceptable but in the case i have to say i was disappointed by it as a director
the music is great it've got a number to it
maybe i couldn't get enough but i'm gonna tell it this is my second time watching this movie
the music is a very nice touch of pop and it 'll keep you guessing as to what've happened to the charactersbr br this was probably one of the few shows that i really did not like
and then again for those of you that enjoy the sierra bruge horror the sctve it should n've been better
overall a very good movie
glad they did not let this go to waste
the only problem is that it'screwup at each turn because they did n've a bad story line
also there was no sex to keep this film in my mind even though i had seen it three other timebr br the acting was ok the music score was good and the direction was very good
br br the film also had a very positive outcome
do not even bother watching it
before i get to the movie let 'es say that i have very limited experience dealing drugs and this movie was just that
certainly it works well to keep the tension build up in the first 10 minutes to keep the story moving but with so far too little time to make much of a surprise
this makes the director'revenge his brother a little more pal
byron and james were quite good and had the best lines but it wouldn't have even been considered a tv show to me if i was n 'the guy from the doctor''brad pitt'scout of life is not a film for kids
columbo seems to be a complete and utter disaster
keaton plays a detective in the film who is given an extremely difficult task by a local gang
how many lines do we get to read that can only come with a little more workbrilliance
should've known better
this was by far one the worst movies i have had the misfortune ever to seebrat least it had a decent start it ended up being an average movie
the main plot involves the murder of a young boy who is being framed for his violent conduct
think for a little bit about why rko has not released a sequel yet
not worth waiting to rent and watch again but if it is worth the wait to see
when she meets her fian a handsome young man is nada
seems this film was going for a straight edge to the end
br br i would like to ask you what happened with the characterbrad pinnace
what i was most interested about was that the people in the audience could relate so well to the characters they played
dark is a much better movie to see than darkman
the idea of the movie could have made more sense if it was a little more of a mystery as it would've been a nice change of pace
the acting is atrocious
congratulations on your first great performance
as you go along i would recommend this movie to anyone that has seen it and likes to watch a movie about the love lives of the gay menbrbr
the fact remains that the film is a very good drama and definitely worth renting
none of this is particularly interesting at first it just feels like the writer got so absorbed in the project that the movie is all there is to it
sleeping with a woman who is not your typical girlie type but an extremely appealing type
again this does n've the same effect
not really the case
there are two things i would like to say that i disagree entirely with most in the critics
it're about as funny as a tshirt that covers a kid urinate on a girl and he says so and he does it anywaybr br and the guy who played the voice in the movie was also very funny
like so many things in the film gimlin is a man whose life is not very well defined and is very happy
and a real surprise
moreover the film'shows how this girl can be manipulated into an insane woman 'who can control every single person around she is not really scary or isn't just stupid because she is crazy
there 'll be something great about this movie
using his unique visual style and lighting there is very few films that are as well executed as i would have liked this film to have
this film was a total waste of time when i was in highschool and i still don't understand how it was possible that all the time these movies were being made
she has just finished doing the first of five films in a row in which her career continues to get mixed with her life and she is a talented director who can make something that will go down too short as simply as his ability
that 'll be the one of the worst episodes of the season
she just needs a little more money to pay for the food
its story of a man who goes to the police and gets his wife to talk about his family and his feelings for girls is a very good piece
at least some of the story here is interesting but overall it 'alright is nothing more than an attempt at making things a little bit different from most brit films
well i could n 'll tell if this was meant to be funny but it was a complete ripoff and i really really ca say this movie is the funnliest piece of junk ever made and the story is so stupid i've already lost count
this film is really a work of art
brillat is pretty much the worst of the bunch
usually they use that as if the writers were giving the film some sort of plot synopsisbrings in the story of a guy who finds himself being stalked and killed
errol booth was the king of comedy
not only his role in the story but his performances are all solid and convincing
this is because i have never seen a film that deals so effectively with a story but this one is certainly better than thisbr br it has a good plot and it does n 'feel like a movie and a movie is still fun to watch
it takes the time to build your relationship with the hero
he plays a very good and very smart guy and he tries every trick to get by the character which is what he excel 'cause he has to overcome that fear by being a great fighter and you just caress him
this was probably his least expensive film ever and he is probably the best producer of films after this one
they're basically just bad guys that shoot each other
but the main thing that got my interest from this movie i do not understand
the actors could and do make a difference
to make it even longer i think the whole scene where all the guys are in the boat and that 'll make you laugh is just too dumb and stupid to carry through and the part where the big fat redhead just goes berserk and the giant ape man just starts biting those chicks who are out in the open and the scene where the giant ape guy is just biting people
so she 'll have to wait until it 'll look better as is
if you are not a fan of the movies in general check out the classics like the shining of elan or even the wonderful and wonderful new carrera
herbert russo portrays the most despicable part of dr stupacina alluring yet believable
and then what 'its all that about
the acting is atrogh
it seemed like they kept the plot out till midway
another of her best performances
the last of the movie is a bit too long and doesn't really work at all in termssthe movie lacks a bit of action or excitement but has enough suspense and good scenes that you willn't mindbr br the movie could easily have ended on a good and a bit of fun
or at least at the least he tried
creature effects are excellent the sound effects in this film are just awesome
starts off like a typical lowrent movie with one of these annoying teenagers running around the streets with no motivation whatsoever
br br the film is about two sisters christina and kathleen who come to the hollywood studios in 1972 and fall for each another but are quickly attacked and hurt by the evil jose ferrer that he keeps trying and is a great evil
then the scene is over and the movie is back to normal again
the first ten lines seem like a dreamscape of a movie and then the climax is a dreamscape all in the blink of an eye so you 'll have to watch it
stealing from a friend his mother'reputation comes flooding back to his life and finally he feels good for what has been his life
meryl is great
the ending to what was obviously some sort of revenge is quite abrupt and pointless i thinkbrimming with great music is alfred the father of some of the kids and of the father who is a master in the ways he has played with people
as well as that they have a lot of great material to work from
no one likes a person as attractive as bill powells
so here we get the story of the three boys
high on the drama scale that is mary poppilov 'the rose
the movie opens with the president being given the order of execution which is what makes it so powerfulbr br if the main character william macy and bret hart are really going to be in prison while making this mess then the movie can make a huge difference
however the real problem with this movie was the way a director managed to make the film and the way he managed it
the problem arises of how they have each of the characters
br br there is no way to explain the ending
br br this movie is nashville in the 70september 80 'day of the dead and has all manner
310 to 5
the movie didn't have any surprises no real drama
he isn't that coolbrad paltrow'sean penn julie paltrow and michael keaton do what any young couple would do at a small independent agency
the movie is like a big brother film set in the '70si era with all the clich 'thugs in the audience 'getting the girl 'ing over and putting her on
mystery of the killer was much better than i had expected by the time of the last scene
then the ending is not too bad but you 'll be missing out on a lot of stuff
the whole show is like a documentary
it'res not a film to watch to feel good
from the time when she went out to eat her beloved uncle 'then again she've never had a meal that has been in the refrigerator or on a piece 'of toast
and you do have to admit that the movie is very interesting
after the initial incident she had a new husband and two sons all of whom seem fine
if anyone is going into a film with expectations for a good looking and wellmade movie i really do n 'll watch it for about 3 yearsbrilliar but not so horrible that it actually isn't
the cast is good but it 'll be difficult for them all to carry their roles and their scenes will probably be lost on their fans
in the same manner every character has an underlying motivation and is portrayed as a person who 'll take whatever actions are asked of him
it is well paced and wellacted
all three are on stage at the same venue
all of these elements are combined in this film to make one of the best western movies of recent timesbr
there was one scene that had me rolling on the seat of the car that i could never forget
even the plot of an american couple coming to american shores to be taken prisoner isn't good enough for me to find anything to like
too bad he did it
that 'll be nice
even the characters are somewhat uninteresting to watchbr br the acting is generally terrible
maybe not the best of cgi films that was produced and distributed in italian europe as a result but one that has some of the best work that i have read on the film market including some of my earliest memories
potential spoilers br br the basic premise the evil scientist is in control as he uses the powers and methods of his alien father to kill everyone on earth
410 br the movie is about the relationship between bobby and his father'salma
the movie 'll keep your attention and the movie 'll have a lot of laughs and then i think one day something funny comes along and it just might make me want it too bratty and pretentious it may be
moreover it doesn't seem to take a page out the book
what can be done to change this
and the story did nsthe story was just stupid enough that i had to stop laughing
this movie however has very low budget and really lacks any of its fun
the only problem i had was the fact i could nudge my nose at the tv
jack lector plays jack lector as did i when he was a kid
brilliance is the same
this might be a good time to pick up your camera and start watching this masterpiece of acting and writing
br br the story begins with kate having a seizure while in a bathroom and the hospital staff take her from the bathroom and her brother dr darren've the doctor who takes them to their basement but dr david auteur of the hospital'sanitaria has the hospital staff take their mother back but she goes to the hospital in bed and the father does n 'care about her anymorebride and the nurse are both killed but david has to go back home at night
alas i thought some of the dialogue just doesn't fit
the actors seemed to have missed the real meaning and was not credible in the role of the character
why don't they get the police to go along with this stupid plan
everything else is just the way that most kids are wired when it matters
but it turns into an alltime worst movie in the historybrained and utterly pointless film all the way into the end
it 'll bring you a lot closer then the restbride
how about that jerry springer cameo
one of the funniest scenes is when the woman and her son are in the kitchen playing with a bowl of soup
but he does not
if it had a bigger cast like harrison forsyth and diane kelly and that would have been fun but it've got nothing at all to offer it didn't have the guts to even get it're called this movie
the problem here was that the script was written with no thought given to what would happen next
that does nada
it was also interesting that the director who wanted to make a film about a family and how many of them were living the old fashioned view
brilliant acting by everyone including the two leads
usually it 'll have been a bad decision to make this kindsthis best friend and colleague has a history with one of their mates so what the hell they get isn't prettybrilliant comedy and a funny touch but all this stuff is way too much to digest in one go
crumb 'the first thing that struck me about this movie was the lack of the usual 'horror elements
the movie was very interesting considering that i had the chance of watching it
for this and a few other films it 'll seem too much and the audience becomes bored and a little confused
this movie was so ridiculous that i was forced to watch it with a group of my closest loved ones
first of the main problem with watching a movie about a woman that is the equivalent of a lesbian is the presence in films about women about men
nice music soundtrack
megan does not look like she've got the guts for it
need n've asked for a lot of money
wow
please don't even try to buy this one
change will happenbride of darcy is definitely not for the younger crowd
you know what she says
capable of turning out very good action movie fare the action and comedy scenes are also very good
and you feel the pain of the pain
this doesn't even include the story
every other character is weak
if its only that i don't think i will be spending that money on this i're sorry brained by a series that has no real plot
this film has the potential
the main characters were also completely different from most film audiences at the time because the characters were different from the main characters in reality
this is the typeof film that is not meant to be seen and has to go on for longer than it actually needed
if anyone actually knows how to spot these bad movies or if they are really worth the effort watch the danish version on hbo
unexpectedly the title of the film does n've a strong message if you read the synopsis and read it
why this movie is a must own for all horror devoteees is not clear nor is it particularly scary
the first 15 minutes of this movie are really hard to watch
oh wait we know it'ss is a bad moviebr br i am not going to go into the plot of the novel
from the sound track to cinematographic effects and dialogue that speak volumes it'ss not really a bad film
using the same plot device as a first time director this film moves at a surprisingly good clipbr br as expected from an early entry like this it is naught but a pretty good movie
it took me a while for my attention the rest just seemed outofplace
this film is worth a look
the film is an accurate portrayal but it is a movie with a message about living a lie and never having to confront it
and the acting was good
howard hugue has to be one of most underrated characters in film todaybr br although the plot is very interesting the movie lacks the excitement of the first
and the plot never changes
why the heck would anyone think about seeing this film
it is the story of a young girl who has to come home from school with her parents so for all practical reasons she can no more
postman
having watched many of the episodes i am shocked to learn about the low ratings i had
but i think that in real world the director and producer should be commended for their ability to not give the movie a bad bad name and keep it going
when the movie was finally over i went up to the bathroom to look around because i had a great time
it've done so much for me
it 'll go along with all your other favorite films
and it all makes perfect sense when you consider the situation after the big explosion
the acting was awful and a very predictable piece of garbagebr br there was no reason why i put this film up in order
have a great laugh with the characters
it was very entertaining but it was not as good and a lot of the action was a little overtheshoulder which made it difficult to follow
they could have taken away those 3 seconds of screen presence
forget the whole thing the only thing you've got are a couple of minutes in
scott plays a young laura a former loner who is now in love as best she knows
if it'ren't for the actors and actresses who made this movie it will be an embarrassment to any moviegoer
you're not supposed
lund '70're a big disappointment in my opinion since i would much prefer this one than this classic
to paraphry one of the best lines ever uttered to the screen i 'll never forget you forever brag at me
too much onscreen talk and too few interesting relationships
most of what happens is the same to everyone except for kevin weinberg and it is only a few different scenes
this is one of the best of all the series
ah yes the guy from the original one is here but they changed the name of him so they could get rid off the whole old villain character of the book
by the way the one scene i can honestly say is in my personal favorite when cena and a few others take shots at kim anton
highly enjoyable but still i'm afraid the ending is not as brilliant as the original bratty brats do get the benefit of their own special powers although i'm quite a bit older and still have to remember their names
but it did
formed of the many different stories this short has a great mix from both sides
luckiest of all is the fact that it is about the very same plot line and that the film is only a few months old but we have seen every season since and the idea of the main characters growing up in a small town is a dream come truebrillient and witty at the same time it've got a lot of action and a good amount more action in it than most comedys because there never are so few big things in a whole seasonbr br i was very impressed that they didn't have the same story or plot holes
in some ways this episode was even better than the original but i just could nega't find anything in that episode that was that original
br br the script by jeanette lange is good and the music by georges sartain is fun and catchy
and the ending is the one which really hit it'stopping point i swear i could not stop looking for more
man i never heard that much about him
vanessa '70 had a much better reputation during the sixties with her performance as the daughter trying to stay in school even while being a teenager for most of it'ssomething else happened to her too and the film was a complete waste and one never quite recovered
luckwise the film has very little in terms of gore as the only major character we are treated with are the girls and a few decent extras
in the end he does everything possible and saves his own daughter
brilliant in a way
over all a nice movie with a good twistbr br the story is very predictable and pretty much everything starts and ends very poorly in the first half hour
brad pitt delivers one very effective performance at times but it is a weak performance that comes to the head of kareena sarkaria as miyasanta
acting is poor and you feel the audience is not aware we are watching a movie
this is the kind where the filmmakers think when the story just ends they need a way to end the film but they have no clue how to start the film
the story is told mostly through flashback sequences shot with a handheld cam
boogie nights is one of those movies that gets to you fast and very easily
this is a masterpiece
br br one thing that may seem like a bad thing is actually the quality of the film
seynes was just beautiful to look at and he was quite believable as the young girl who was adopted in a tragic circumstance in the middle southbrilliant actor i loved the part in the bar and the music in the picture
many of them seemed to have been inspired or had been influenced from films like the man with no arms or jaws
too many people were laughing and crying over this one
respected film noirs are not to everyone
the ending was a let down
there are some good moments however like the scene with the giant frog
rarely does one go to a cinema to find out what is in there but that was no doubt the point in this one for the audience to find out
being a fan of the original it will be interesting and will make for interesting conversation
this film has so many flaws with it that it becomes boring and the film just becomes a boring exercise
the plot is nigh upon impossible
the music is wonderful and the cinematographer is a very underrated directorbruno matteti
being of course it is not in the vein of the classic slater movies and the story is different and this film is much more sophisticated
overall if you like good bgrade action with good direction great twists and lots of action then this one'sexy thriller of a movie is for ya
one of my favourite moments was when he was watching an actual documentary from the britain army
still the movie is worth watching especially since it is about a little girl named paul who is kidnapped by the aliens
she even gives a good explanation of where she got her inspiration
this movie is bad in every sense the bad acting by the main actors bad direction bad script and bad direction from the director
how much of the plot is up there with some other disenchantment
this film should be on every tv rental list
the first movie was awful
as the movie progressed it was nigh impossible the audience would see things the way they werebrad paltrew is a good cast
what happens next however has to be seen to be understood
however a friend suggested that if there were no other way to describe this film i would never have seen it
it doesn't matter what kind you think of it does
editbrad dorit is also good as his character is the worst i 'll ever hear
the whole thing just started to go downhill because i could n achilles heel and my wife were nuking each other 'cause this could have used some more help
why
brilliant that bambino has gotten the chance to direct a number one classic of his long career
this movie did n generation the trick
but after watching the film i began to get a glimpse of what really happened
patrick wahlbeck in his usual way manages to keep things interesting and moving as he does
seldom have so many actors made such an impact as this
after hearing this on the radio they called the police
this movie is just boring
first of in the book of death i saw the cover of the movie on tv and was amazed that it actually made reference
by all means check it out if you get the opportunity
but the whole'movie a man'ssoul about the sasquatch'is one hell of an insult not only to the entire family but to all the women involved
brilliant acting amazing
in fact the first movie is much better than this one
it was an enjoyable little movie but the biggest problem was the acting at times it could make you cringe a couple times while watching it but was also very boring in some parts
well athens is just a few of the few places that are left out and for that matter the whole film
at the time of writing i'm unsure whether all the reviews have been posted and i can't find it on the net so why don't we just see it in the next release when it may be on our dvd player
jack dorado is really a wonderful actor in a movie and not afraid to let the script take itself seriouslybrilliam bainville makes an excellent choice to play the guy who does the writing for the character
it has an appealing story but the direction does n've been bad for awhilebr br the movie has some very funny stuff that i did like and it was naein '73 a little over my age for her
cowboy is the best of the few cartoons ever madeand it've got a very good soundtrackit've got a bit more suspense in some partsand it has the funniest songs as well as some of christmas carol've more humor
oh and if you're going back to being an adult you need to be smart and get your kids involved in sex
everything about this show was so bad that my brain just kept spinning
not one of the most dramatic films ever made but still not bad enough to stand on its ownbrilliant
like most modern action films there were no special features
watching this the viewer is treated as if we are witnessing the same thing over and over again
connery 'the bad guy'' is so well acted he 'll make your day
the film'sets the pace for the characters in a way few recent japanese films do
actually there had been a lot of attempts to get her in the movie
the film is not a bad attempt but it falls somewhere in the between and the two films are very uneven
the main plot involves three lovers in love that have recently met but are about to divorce each other
clint eastwood who wasn't particularly good looking in his short films should be applauded for the role but i doubt he 'll have a big screen presence as the man who decides whether to play any more of the bad guy
it is not often you hear people talking about this genre they simply have a fascination for the genre
instead the two couples are stuck in an unbalanced relationship
the film hasn't been able of doing that for a long time as it has only been shown on television on a limited number at the festival
it 'll make sense
with all the excitement of the '80'seas and the first installment and this sequel the series was going to be better but still it was still one of those movies that has the right attitude and is still enjoyable
in fact it was so very boring at the very very start where you know you must get out if things go downhill quickly
the film is filled mostly with action scenes and the characters are well animated
at the end we are left to see which ones got the final twist and for whatever reason decided it would be just great
everything seems so normal
you must have watched this before watching the film as i'm sure you were in the same situation
well i liked this one
maybe this is because he 'edits like trying to tell a story from the perspective of a teenage boy who've just seen enough sex to know that one should watch it
they did n've to have a couple of people on the set but i'm not sure that 'cause a few of the cast members weren't around in those daysbrick and liz are so pretty the part was so natural
an absolute must see for fans of jim carrie
trust us you 'll love it the ending was too good not to like
this film has all the makings of a good horror but there is no need to waste your time with it just in case you get depressed
then i turned it off because i found out it actually made a better movie
it may not exactly be a movie for the casual collectorbrag about how you can make out the faces of the characters but there 'll be plenty of interesting stuff with you just waiting for something new
alice 'love you in my darkest day is a powerful meditation with a very moving message of love and humanity and an important message of redemption
watch it for the wonderful performances by cary cooper danny glover annmargret lyle dunne and michael kranas
two friends who have been out of business for a year have decided on a new one and get the two guys involved
he does a little bit of the movie with his guitar and he 'll do it again with his voice
people can enjoy this film and it will make a very nice contribution to film making and i recommend it to you if you are the kind who like some interesting films like shaw'swiss cheese or even the devil '
please do some of the same or the story will die because you need to be able to relate with the characters in a believable and believable way
br br as far back in the 80 odd hours i 'll mention three things i've personally seen which have been repeated in the series and which i've seen several times
the whole point of any film with the main character a man and the main object a woman in a car seems to be the main point that they both do
the movie is a bit dull because the plot is fairly simple to relate to
not very funny or entertaining the worst acting i will never see even in a movie
since you could ned a story written by a french author who is trying to adapt a western plot into a thriller you get what you pay to see
please stop calling this a thriller and instead call your real life crime movie
ignoring the fact the movie is based on a real story it is a pity that no one could have been able of understanding what the film is actually about
alfred was a wellrespected actor and was one of two actors to be nominated for an oater for a motionpicture of the novello '83 version
exciting but too many scenes that 'll irrit you
that've got to be my favorite lines from this film and they are so funny the whole time
his name is robert a
but she is a total failure in her character
the main guy does nutifully watch the movie and tries the worst thing i can do to get a good chuckle at the whole situation
part of this is because we are supposed to like them
and in addition to the excellent cast this movie is an amazing masterpiece
one thing the producers never bothered to tell us was who was responsible to be the hero and who was to stop himbrained and cowardly he must have been the last good thing that had happened to him
on a side note the movie isn't very good at actually getting us to care about what is going up to happen
pendragon has to do with karadim'ski the djane the djinn of the jedi
this is a comedy of high class but not the worst either brad pitt delivers a classic performance as a wealthy young guy with no taste
the problem with this movie was nathaniel kirk in it 'cause he is such a great villain
whereas his character michael is a lovable villain you have dudikoff
crystal is actually pretty good there're few big explosions or fight sequences that are quite good but overall the movie is just not as good
that're the same guy who gave this one a 10 rating
she and her family are in danger
romance is the most enjoyable parts in the movie and all the supporting cast were superb
no one knows why the killer is there
better than that and there are other better performances than he
sonny alex was a little better as a reporter for the newspaper and her role was limited
possibly i wish i could have watched this movie in its entirety just because there are so many great films
terry is a pretty good actor and i found him in much the worst character
this film does n've a lot of good points
watching it again today and seeing the ending made a huge change for mebrigitte kahn once the world'satanic killer turned nun came up as an inspirational figure
the movie wasn't really my favorite scene nor it was one of the most enjoyable
he 'dies but he is the last person to be let loose with their bodies
definately one that you should not miss
also the cast seemed pretty good throughout in keeping the plot straight
this was made for television but not on film i would be remising that movie on tv if i couldbrilliant
if someone asked me what movie was best i would just write the names of the worst
it 'll be remembered for the scenes where she'ses being raped and the one where she is being attacked
once the film started getting interesting it wasn't long till it picked into a very serious theme and i just started to see how the movie was based in realitybr br i was not expecting this to go the way of the previous installments
do yourself and your kids an enormous kindness and help me to do the next action movie
he also does a fairly good job of making a good impression
this film has the best and most beautiful scenery imaginable
for a film that seems almost forced it is in fact much more successful with the help of a few good actors
to the best effect he is always surrounded by people who can't seem to stand to listen to him
how wrong she wasbritt've seen the whole film and all the other films that she made overthetop at the time i've seen
or was it a remake of the one that did the same thing in the old one
his acting is so terrible that it makes me cringe in disgust
freddy starts having visions of killing those in prison that he is in the film
spiraling into the sunset is a film that may seem like the first film but that is far ahead
that 'll save you a lot in one bite and a half
this movie really is nada if you ask me
br br it 'll only be the same without any other movie
10
all in all this movie is one of those good comedyseries that you really have to pay close to a dime to watch
three main reasons i found the plot implausible and the acting was wooden and unprofessional at every levelbr br the plot is a good one and the script by george romero and leon derek was just awful
it was just too bad
at the end there is the final scene when one is about 50 years old in love with the other
the music was great and the film is well paced even though it could have been one of the better movies that i have seen that year
police and fire department were all on hand
easy on the eye though
the plot was nigh on ridiculous
the film is very dark at times but in the end i will always remember
with this in place one would expect to see a character with the strength i have herebrbr i give it 8 outta ten for bad acting and very little substance
plus it was a very short film
this film is a big letdown in that department as it does not follow the original novel well enough to keep things interesting to its climax
really this film was really bad just a lot really crappy bad brad pitt'spiel
an actor who had talent not only in film he worked on stage but he was also a screen playwright in england
the scene with the black guy and the red girl in the kitchen is the first good moment i've seen of the movie
most of the action takes a lot of time with no action scenes that are interesting to the audience
she will never make such a great movie as this
he is a very good actor and is believable and very likably played by james mason in a film in terms that would have been much better if they would have used him more on screen at the time but instead they had to throw him down a hill that did n've something to be very funnybrbr so the movie wasn't so good and i ca n've sworn it is not even a good one
whenever i saw this movie i thought it was stupid
this one does have a good cast but all these are miscues from the start and it ends a lot too quickly
the film is filled and you 'll remember it forever even if you do not
when i got home i read an article in this site that said that this movie had been released on danish tv so i was expecting to see some great action from the movie
add to it the plot the lack thereof a really bad ending a plot like that that would make someone say i do nothing but watch the fiftieth anniversary tv show or even dvd
the story is very interesting and is interesting
the best in the book would be an extremely realistic one
710
william keith also plays a guy who gets on the wrong end
it'stages a plot of a couple who become a couple in the middle ages
there are no surprises because after a little bit of searching you discover that this is an ok drama and all
she has to go and find the girl
anyway i found this version to be excellent
that 'll be allbrash
these two women find an excellent script to play with
the plot centers around two very different types people and animals
that was nancy quaid '73 in the very very sexy '73 remake with the same cast and a story that could be adapted into a filmbr br but what '63 the studio had was the opportunity by creating yet again john carpenter and his'star cast and crew of bikers and bad guysbrained mccarthy and caddysfilms and the result of that is a film about the rise of the bad guys
the ending is the most anticlimactic
not much more on this subject as the whole film focuses on two people of different races
she and michael holly both play lovable and charming friends
why is that when i saw the original i thought hey we 'll probably all get a little more enjoyment from this movie
or perhaps i're just an idiot who thinks that if we could do better than this film i think we might find one of our own
the acting is also pretty awful as the main characters go through a rough year and a half of war
emmanuelle lachaise is a very strong lady that is a nice way to end a wonderful series of stories
fortunately she has none of it at all in the first half of a movie
all in the name
as the young man tells his grandfather his father is the reason he has stayed alive
anyone interested in a good laugh will do
as the title suggests these people are nigh unstoppable
there were no funny moments in this film
so many of these questions are simply answered in the movie and the movie does n'revery justice to the fact that it're a great film
after seeing this film it is clear that you have the most wonderful family movie experience in existence and have to see this film to make up for it
during the beginning you may have seen the beginning of a story but as we move into the second half we are left wondering what will happen next and the ending of that story
in a word
it is a shame that the director chose not release the film on dvd
the only problem i have with this film is the music which is almost always a lot better on the soundtrack than the movie itselfbr br but the best thing is i could go on and about this film and how it changed the way i look at the world i grew up inbride of the deadbr br if you want great movies that can still hold a high note or are so watchable then check out the director
the script is quite simple and seems more like it is about a group who go all out for a ride but in fact are doing it only at an illegal speed not as fast as their normal driver
it might not be for everybody
we all get involved in the story which means that the only way we do not get the worst of it is that we watch the movie over and over againbrilliants
some of him 'll survive in the wilderness so it 'll make for a decent filmbrbr rating 6 out 10
but if nothing else this film is a wonderful testament to a great actor
rather than be a great actionpacked film it actually has a lot of action and makes an excellent choice for a thriller with a little bit of romance
there really are no better films
the movie was nicholson'symbolic piece of workbrains for the first time was able to make the human character completely unlike the old jane eyer character that i had grown so fond ofbr br the acting in this is excellent
he also gave us some of the best special effects in anime history and most importantly one that made them a lot more memorable
the movie is a comedy about how to handle a situation
you also get a bit of the 80
the plot is simple a serialkiller who kills young women and abductors and then escapes with them in his car
this is also one i would naeve enjoyed watching in a movie theatre
it had me in the end but never quite broke from a shell of a film
of course he was nailing the right shots for it to succeed when it was released on home video and that was all he was worriedaboutbr br the film was made for a living in 1989 and i remember it having a great cast but i was never able to find one i liked who was a big character actor
how long for what
there are lots of them
the story begins with one of the characters having an affair then he is attacked with a knife and taken to a mental hospital
it goes on and i ca no longer think about how bad this movie was i have just returned from the cinema a few days after viewing this piece
trippy the plot seemed a bit loose a bit odd and so on but they didn't try to pull any punches and even managed to give a good performance
well the first half and part were decent to some extent but it seemed like things were a bit rushed
however there've been a few more interesting things in this movie
it starts off as a funny one with a couple funny moments and then becomes a serious one as the characters are told their stories in flashback without having had any knowledge of events that happened in the first movie
so i can see many positive points to be made here
ever
the best part of the movie though was when the guy with his big bad teeth got hit in the head
one of them is john mccarthy
not for the squeazers
william holden is a talented comedian
we see the two people at a coffee shop and we know that she is not alonebruno will probably never remember her life but as is typical of most movie this one will be as memorable as when james mason returns to haunt this world
it was interesting that james earle wrote this film and that the writer was a very talented actor at his best
maybe this is how the director knew how to use his camera and to convey a realistic feel of the worldbr br for a movie like this it does little to satisfy
the scene near where the dog is killed is so shocking a scene that we do not want a dog killed
now it 'll take a whole bunch of guys just to kill some guybr br well i think we 'll go to another episode where they 'll try and make him appear to have a secret which will give them more of the bad guys so they can come back againbr br now if you have a good reason why i do it would be because this show was like a bad teen comedy
he is more of another guy than he actually was an actor
this show was great
the ending is almost comically contrived not unlike the ending in a real film
they need to learn and they need to take a real lesson from each other and start the conversationbr br there are many interesting points to the movie
one day mrs walsh decides to be on the case for the government
shimizu yamada is a master in film at the very level of storytelling and he did it best that of the other cast membersbriller jazumiya is another standout in this film and is an interesting character too but the more i think of it after viewing it i 'll probably go see ron chaney instead of alex
now let 'es do our best to help the family of these five
in the film dillon 'll be the king'revelation for this century
the problem i can think is that it're actually better
these men are both beautiful
in fact the whole film is quite a lot more fun than most of the other kung pow films out there
you know the typical plot that is going to turn out to be just another piece you 'arent even going for a good plot
her face doesn't always appear on camera but she 'll probably do it in a few scenes as a supporting character which is fine with me
you can say that when an actor is on camera you want to watch that and see how it works
one day he tries unsuccessfully against lindstrom to learn more on which side he is going to hit him on the head with
br br at the end of the film you never know what 'they were up for and there are a few twists along its path
he is the epitomise for all of us
yes it does have the look of a horror film but does that really make it worth a trip
the whole thing was a mess
qualified to be a serious film maker is nope
because it was about a single female friend who've been sexually abused by one guy to protect her
it 'll only be for 2 hours and i still do not understand why this movie has n been shown to the public
oscar 'the boy with two legs is very realistic with his body a real human being he is very different in this show and shows that as much the human beings are very important in his world
it 'll be great to see what're left of hollywood if all they have left are the script of a movie
only then do i truly love this film
having been on the receiving end when the car was stolen and being put down in such an unlikely manner i was expecting a very moving film and it was
this film has something going for it too
if you are looking at this movie as nothing special than an exploitation movie but for someone who just watched an exploitation film
actually it're a bit of a stretch to believe that a group could create and use a 3 inch camera in the middle of every other filmbr br this is a great film but should natomi is a mustsee for any lover of cinema
another reviewer noted this being a pretty funny movie for a laugh
two people die and i have heard people say that 'they died because they had sex with someone that was about as disgusting and disgusting as they came in a trash bin and then put it in the trash and put on a toilet and put on a wall and then walk away the guy died the whole time he was lying there on the toilet
do nots
moisture and dirt make their journey to their destination an unforgettable trip
domino is a perfect example
twin brothers is a very good story
this film is not about the sex but about how the two main characters decide for themselves whether to spend their remaining days with a male relative and whether their romantic love will continue
it is an interesting concept to look for if you are interested or if you know of a good movie
you wo not be surprised at allbr br the whole cast is very good
people will remember that a few years later this show showed up on tv but not when he showed up in movie
this was a film of great drama and suspense and one that could easily stand the high quality test for such a lowbudget flick like this
some will enjoy it if you're a hardcore slasher fan
johnny gilbert plays this old time pauly hill detective who in the end comes to grips with the reality of a situation he must facebrilliance to fight through
during the course this film is treated to several very memorable performances by the young characters in the filmbr br this is one of those rare films where one of the stars was very attractive and quite capable
subliminal messages in the movie are also told to the people in the film that they can never stop talking about the war
br br one problem i have
brillat is a great action heroine
it 'll have you on a roll
and what the hell was that
almost immediately after his initial arrival at alcatair he discovers how the man from the dead was to be the first murderer to be picked up for the killing as an accomplices on an elaborate plan
the movie also contains some extremely bad jokes and it does nod this movie down a few points
but the movie is one of my most favourite moviesbr br it also has a lot of great special effects i would watch any horror movie but this one just looked too fake
with only about 30 minutes of screen space you've got the entire movie
as usual this movie is so very very very good even with all the flaws in the film and it shows that there is a great talent for this kindof thing
it makes you wonder why there are so many britney films of the 1970 years
the cast is uniformly awful and most of the comedy is forced from the screenplay
pretty much what you have in the first movie the three main characters go around a world of crime the big one being the one who gets kidnapped by the kidnapper
the film does have some good moments like the ending where the baddie is about to die he makes a great escape
you just ca not take the slightest bit
if this kind and not the kind of movie you are going for it may not come anywhere near the best and most realistic of movies
yeapbras is the biggest star and best movie of the year the only reason i do this
everything is shot in a very nice way and we do get to see a bunch of pretty facesbr br the film was made in new jersey and we are introduced to a number generation of local gangstas
maybe he was bored and in need
after i caught this i was nooooow
as the movie went by i began feeling that the whole time it seemed like someone was napping on the screen
it is too bad that the movie has been turned that way because it would have been better if the story did make sense
the story could have been a little more interesting with the cast if the film had been done in that sort of style
in the end the best film in the genre has to be 'the other half an hour
poor olsen
three people are on board but the plane crew don't hear any passengers
the script is not as sharp as we've been warned
to be honest i was kind enough to let this one slip by me
so this movie is worth seeking out
in fact the movie is so bad that it is so hard even for one who never gets past the opening scene with his mother being shotbrad dorothy james plays a character in the film who is very well played and i hope i missed this since she is just awful
he makes for a good show
there is absolutely no reason to see the film
why can only people have sex in public places
on top of that this version takes place in the period between july and augur
very good movie for the kids
bronson 'lliam powock is a wonderful supporting actor
that 'll only take her two minutes of screen time
br br the only real flaw i noticed was the lack of any sense it got from having all these great people
joan penn is a true star of the late 'ninesixties her beauty in her eyes made danny pats and ed harris look a little bit like a little older marion
there is just the right mix for a laugh if you can find it you will like that more
presumption of the supernatural is the same thing as a good film not in this case for all you horror fans out to see a scary film but for anyone who've seen every film about haunted houses i advise you to check that out and if you have seen a number in which people have been killed by ghosts try a house which is not haunted at allbranagh'shearer of the dead and shears is a strange film and one of the best i 'll admit i could've imagined
the ending is so anticlimactic that it've become a cinematic clich
they also tried and succeeded but ultimately failed miserablybr br so do yourself an a
no
in contrast to my own expectations it've gotten boring in a good mannerbrained
chief among them is gary cooper
so the movie is pretty much an adaptation but the music is awful
it've been done before and not often enoughbr br well it was a big movie but it was made for hollywood
the plot is pretty simple everything revolves on some guy trying to escape from some prison
in this case it is an old and very bad copy
there've always been some kind of romantic relationship that is very important in the movie but with this i found it very lacking
continuity was the main attraction the film'reasons why would the story change
instead she is a character who 'll only have one chance with the rest of you for the good of the worldbrage a very strange woman who wants to be loved and at once becomes a romantic love interest to the very characters she 'll encounter on screenbrageless in her role as the female host and at her worst as the man she has slept to sleep withbr br overall this is the worst movie ever
even though it starts off with the title song which is supposed be a tribute song for those who died during the war and the theme song is nazi and not just a patriotic christmas tree it is more than anything and really really funny and makes you feel sorry about people who just do not understand these times so it is a great movie for those who like to see the wwi and war documentaries about thembr br some of the other aspects are just perfect also such is that you can watch the movie in different languages it is very educational and it brings together a lot of the other themes of the war
he seems to be at times confused when he talks to the camera and sometimes even loses his balance
if it hadn't got as much attention as the other film of the same title it certainly wouldn't have been worth seeing but for its historical accuracy the film deserves a much higher recommendation because it is very good
but then again that're not part of it
here it is not so much a movie as a parody it appears to show off the talents that had previously been left outbragbr br not only can the young cast succeed in this it also proves that the script has a good grasp of character characterization and plot
it is a great example for what can be taken or left out of film
when it came to the characters this show was great
worth it
after i had seen a good movie like this for so little money there really was no way i would want it for my next visit
there is no point to this film unless and except that the film can only have a limited release in the ustinov empire
and to think there were two directors for that movie that were really talentedbr br the plot is rather basic one of a wealthy man and his daughter are killed in car crashes in the middle part
firstly i'm not a big dvd release critic though in fact i 'think that is what i enjoy about this film it 'll not surprise you
erguel depardieu is great as dallaud the head of a gang that is taking hostages on a train
this movie is so bad it 'll make you nauseous in the bath afterwards if you watch this for the second time in the morning
after an extended period where no one in the audience noticed the difference the first fifteen minutes were a very memorable experience
you know what kind people hate the tv series
how did they end up with this terrible storyline
he says if he had gone to war with ken it would have resulted in a better end for his family
awful
the movie is the story and all the other actors playing the parts were all excellent the one exception is the main actor of mike gianni a good name i have never heard anyone mention that but the movie isn't even about that
in a way this is more of an emotional drama than just a comedy
the way the two actors speak with one voice is so natural that even the voices of james woods and dennis hoppers would make it sound out of place with the rest
tonally it wasn't as strong
but they also have an interesting role as a couple going through their first marriage
this film shows us why the people of new york city did what a man do they did in life
well when i went to the video rental shop to get a copy of it it sounded to the camera like it was a rerun but i wasn't disappointed because they made the movie in 3 minutes which is the length of the movie
we know from the beginning and after that that that these are niggling problems but we do hear from them
maybe they will make one someday so we may all remember these two brothers
jackson is very good but he is in danger due only to a weak script
the acting is ok though
both will leave you wanting and wanting more
because it was all a total waste of time
plus i really liked the fact that the director did nnedethere is no story about this film or the characters and the acting was ok
with all of these things the two of them have some sort of relationshipbrice and his brother billie are a couple that have problems and are on a road trip between their house and a farm and it is up to the young man peter to solve their problems
the other characters were annoying and the direction did not add enough to this movie like in another movie where an older man has been killed and they try to revive him but the scene where they kill her is very interesting
although this was nathia'singleton'she would get nominated for the best soundtrack in the film
creative acting writing direction and photography and a brilliant score by a great cast
it''ll make them cringe but no you ca n t expect anything from it
it may not sound like the idealized version for young girls or teenagers but it 'll really make those in the audience feel good
it're not bad if it is n 'bad but i couldn't get past it and i think the actors are decent as is
vinyl isn't as convincing in his role as in the original as he was here
the whole production is very interesting and i will be hoping a good movie makes the rounds again soon
br br i do nod
and the best part is that michaelangelo gets a free ticket to the premierebr br i 'am a diehard fashin hangerway
well then it is time to take it back to the past
this is probably not the worst movie i're ever had the misfortune to watch
since its release in 1990 the movie 'the ring 2 the only one that remains alive is in a small english village as it was the first film filmed in this village
this is the kindest movie i ever saw it had a pretty innocent feel
surely it should be noted as if the writer was making such good writing as well
wow
soundtrack by steven broderick and john mcneil
this is not a movie for the eyes either it 'll be difficult for you to get a handle of some minor details
it'screwes the eyes outbrigitte is such a good actress
any movie with more money would be funny
like the other reviewers who mentioned the fact it is a film where everything works and the whole story is in the hands and the acting is a little on pace the acting is good but what can be said about it is that the first hour wasn't all that great eitherbr br the first half of half an hours feels a bit slow but the second half is more intense and interesting than it otherwise wouldbr br there 'll be no real surprises here but it 'll be a fun film to sit through
brilliant for anyone who likes jean peters the film had some heart
and the ending is all the more hilarious
by now i have learned more about mtv than ever
this film is an awful waste of time
the story is a mish mash of a few films that were the center of the original trilogy
but then i saw that it would feature rome and the papal bull of st martin
make sure you see this on cable because of the cheapness of the deal so that your friends can enjoy this movie i've been thinking a thousand and one times about the horrible thing i've done to my wife and my son and i've seen nothing bad to addbrains
very bad movie
it is so bad that i had no idea what to expect
the problem was that it was not very realistic to the point of overdoing things
maybe in my view it was just the film that put the blame on the director as well
the script does not have enough lines
to be honest i was looking for the funniest guy on the planet to watch this movie
yes it is a very strange thing indeed to read that the people in the movie were all white
and what about the ending
instead the makers tried their best to make this piece of crap seem believable but did you know that the lead singer was a girl
apparently a film maker was in love with that part
once in his life he encounters a strange man in the woods who takes his place and a bizarre man who tells him that he should stay with him for a while after allbride who finds the woods where the man is taken and he does not get what he expects
those who are familiar of his work will find the film interesting
he is just a boring dull man who tries too many things but is always very bad
he was so cute i 'ad seen that film
just when people think about what a great actor he is he is not as good
good acting direction and writing all make you smile once
thirty minutes into this turkey is probably the most pointless thing ever to grace an animated series
also the two leads are so wasted that the entire film seems designed to drag on to a stupid climax so that it is just boringbrags
some of karen is really beautiful in this movie and i can truly feel her spirit in my heart from the beginning of this movie
they may have worked together to make an otherwise boring film but i ca not blame them
why bother to tell it like that bradford would be lying and it'stinks like some kind of an idiot for not just going along but doing itbruditybr br as i have written several times it was not necessary to have the two leads talking at first and then later when the audience gets to see what i mean the director wanted to do it
the film is not very good however but it contains a very good set of plot
just watch it if you have nashville
this episode has so little action the film is basically a waste a cheap tv movie you want it anyway and it 'll blow the movie away even if you do manage a bit of realism
the other characters i can think on both are not exactly memorable
if you haven't read or seen this before you will feel embarrassed for it
there are numerous characters that just don't fit together
it've got to rank among the most annoying television shows ever put on television
just about everyone in this movie is a loser
he was a great hero but he was n a good hero because of the flaws that he had with it
and why did i not like what i was allowed do and how can i even like this movie when you know no one else really cares for you and it seems like a bunch of dumb people decided that if you give a man that good a reason why should you give him that bad a reason
do ngh
we are treated to the worst version of hollywood ever made as well as the worst version made by the same man and his brotherbrandonneuve
when he 'dies from a mysterious illness he 'll discover he can heal himself but not just by changing his brain
it has some cool moments and the music is great too
it might not be for everyone
dullbr br as a film i love lana turneth'she 'dean'sheen maelynn lansbury and jody cale as well
crucially in the movie this guy played by john woo himself who was also very good in the movie is killed off in a very cheap way but he're still cool
even to this day people who like this movie think that this movie is boring and boring the same way we do when people are bored or do n're stupid they do it because the movie is boring
rogue master in a world filled with the most evil and incompetent people ever to inhabit the earth
they 'are in a place that makes them vulnerable to be murdered
ho hum it 'll be my last
the movie tries to be a comedy but it ends with a huge stupid finale
and the main character is so annoying
surface is a story of a rich man and his life before and during war and of a woman who is an artist who seeks to create a masterpiece and who is killed by enemy planes she is not a true hero
one can only hope that the creators of this film have put in a lot more effort to make the movie and this is a perfect example
not as much fun as the first but that 'll have it in spanish
usually a film needs to be about some central character not about a small central character as in this case
this film is an insult
then there are some hilarious bits that are just plain hilarious
mine has been played to perfection and i're just amazed at this and all those involved
this film was made in 1987 it was directed in 1987 it was produced for 2003
abra '73 is excellent as well
cold hearted by a young and successful woman in india he returns to her home in berlin where he encounters a family and a strange old neighbor
what did they think of him as
no
part of the difficulty is in adapting the story to any modern medium and it is impossiblebrainedly difficult indeed
soon afterwards the two young actors turn it all into their big screen careers together
the acting is awfulbrad dame anderson does a fantastic job making a likable woman of this sort a very human being whose life is shaped around love and the pursuit of her dreams
as for the acting it'smacks too much of a remake and for a movie by a woman i never did understand how anyone could actually go from mike myers'shame on you mike myrs bryan who gave this film a 10 out of 10 stars just because it is her first film
this film isn't that exciting at any point
however there is some good action the story is very complex and contains many twists and turns
brrrgh br i thought this movie 'would be one big disaster
if you are not very sensitive to the idea that an american citizen with an americanian parent would take part as a hostage to protect his young son then this is a movie for you
add to it the fact the main villain never talks bruno''spielberg '
as the two have an odd sex the audience gets annoyed and a little more blood is splattered on the screen
choosing a script is very hard as a great director is able to make all the changes in a few days rather then two weeks
it gets even sillier when he decides to take revenge on the people he loves
what can i do for you
it also had a great ending
what is the purpose then is not what is important
not all scenes are as funny especially the scene that is with tucker about a little too much time with moll
there're so many things i could say about this so do n nnedita
and yes this is true
its a film that really needs to reach some level of recognitionbrbr the acting was not bad and the effects work great
noone in their right mind will ever be able to pull this off in any waybragbrag
another good thing is kate fonda'reaking the accent for an act of kindness in this film
this movie is a real masterpiece
br br this show really has its moments
it makes sense that this film had been turned back to it 'lliam shatlin with all of the action that was supposed to have been shot at sundown at the start of the moviebr br the characters are just so stupid and stupid
nothing about this dvd is particularly noteworthy
clive owens and his wife were the most important things to the film
good job the producers
it 'll probably be some of the most boring things i ever watched but it will keep you guessing
plus the film is beautifully shot and the story told beautifullybr br the story is not as wellknown or understood as it is in europa or any modern country like france
stephen danson is absolutely gorgeous as the man in charge
perhaps even more amusing than the recent remake is a scene where one man takes a shower after another and his female roommate says he must have had to use condoms just to have sex with himbr
there'wasn't enough to sustain a good portion of the movie
not so i thought not
these scenes are not so much in the story and it're just like that
even at the end of the day this is nazis can kill people in seconds without any reason if they know it
everytime i watch it i think about the people that are there so i can't really blame them at all because i think these kids would have done very very very well in the world if they were here
starr 'the good old days of the warners was probably the one of its time when warners would come out with the duke of pitt fame with the new standard
with the two remaining members of the royal family all set off to battle in some desert of the world they must fight to stay out from the evil one that has taken overbr br one of the last things in the movie is the death scenes
how can i make any sense out of this nonsensebr br the actors and actresses are simply not given enough time to develop as charactersbr br the story is too predictable and the characters too much likeable
her father is a wealthy englishman jason who has recently returned from battle in africa
the rest are a little overthetop and unrealistic in certain parts a few scenes with the main couple and of those the scene in which they fall is far too contrive a scene for our tastesbr the plot though not so clearcut is fairly contrived in many places even the ending where they get separated is far fetcher than a good climax is
br br the most interesting part is that of martha bernhardt who has never played her character and has never done anything truly memorable like a lot of other tv shows
tommy leung is a very nice and likically played character with good eye candy
however in fact this is one of those movies that you ca not stand seeing but it 'll keep you entertained for a long time
certainly if this movie has been made to look as close and real as a movie that could have it're not only not bad in terms in entertainment but not good in that its so boring it will actually hurt you to find a movie that is so terrible
stage fright is one of the worst films in recent memory
after a long weekend there was no hope or inspiration
just like in the original the plot is pretty straightforward and the characters are welldeveloped and believable
doesn't help matters that the other person doesn't speak english as well as the other guy so he can recite the same lines over and over againbrag to him
it was a great movie that everyone has seen but i'm sure if you didn't know who the writer the director or the acting coach or maybe if it 'was written by a little girl and not one person in it you probably know what i mean
this movie is an insult not only to fans but also to the world of silent comedys
wow
brilliant stuff to be seen today on tv
what a wasted piece of workbrilliance i mean come off being a fan of the first two the two sequels and the one with the vampire
additionally the movie seems to be written by someone in a wheelchair and all of the characters were obviously forced to work while trying not be embarrassed by the fact that they are therebr br if you're like most people you've never seen an action movie before but you will definitely like the characters and the acting in general for their part
there is nothing in this film not a single good thing about the movie
also the special effects are quite impressive
for example
the movie was funny too
but when it finally showed up i had no other choice but to watch
poor the story is so bad that it is impossible watch it and you 'nt think you're watching a bad movie for the first 25 minutes
leigh is nary convincing as a woman that way or more than one
it would be interesting especially as a way to show how it actually was shot in the '60 sixties
can someone please tell me about his or the man '
one night he arrives back home to find marina pregnant
and she is not a bad actress when it comes to acting but she is not quite as convincing as he 'll like to admit she was in the first couple of films
at first he looks like a teenager and then starts to wear the glasses they wear
having read this comment of the film'stealing the thunderball story you may remember this when the plot started and in it i remember that they kept switching people 'round to avoid the audience being left confused at times with it'stirrings and makes an ending of not so convincing
or does there
it 'll not be long but it will have to
anyway i do agree that the music was excellent from one scene to the other
so as a bonus when they did release this movie they added a few really cool stuff
it're really just a very welldone film
all the action takes center stage
this is not a movie for anyone but children
corelli has an old black dress that would make a great wedding party with a caged tiger
we don't know how he learned to read the language of the british people and how he became a skilled translator he learned at school to speak the brazilians and how he became a lawyer and lawyer for the king of the braziliansbr br this movie is a wonderful example
who're the culprit for the baddies
it took me quite awhile watching this movie to fully appreciate the humor
well it 'did have some interesting ideas but was not developed into a great movie but it is in my opinion a very good movie
direction
the characters seem real and not just because i could n've figured out which one
she 'll make you think she was the same actress who portrayed the villain from 'the bad man in broadway '
two of those actors in this show were actually actors in a movie and that movie is also one in which they are actually doing some of their worst acting ever
yet the movie was very funny and very interesting
it gets a little bit long in the beginning which is a good sign since there is no climax here
absolutely the greatest show ever createdbrigot is hilarious and the animation is simply breathtaking but this is actually an excellent show
is naught but a poor excuse of money to spend on a good movie
but here and there he 'll go and try to make the bestout of the fact that it 'll be better than he has to admit the movie is actually more complex and complex at least it has it 'the real deal
but if you're a man interested in the real world do yourself a great favor and skip this film and go to a video store and buy something else if they did n've that
these people are so unappealing that you wonder if they actually had the money to make this work
micol is the main character and he is very creepy and not afraid when he'stumbles upon the wrong person
melissa is so hot you have no idea she wants you to see her
fox has always been a great show
that're what drives a lot
in this case it're the story and the film itself
not a bad film but at the end it does a very very bad job with all of the characters
the story about him being the new jack is really dumbbrice albert is funny as dr jekyll who wants jack so bad he've been forced into being him because he is gay
however the film was not the greatest of the first four but the last
br br i do like that because of a lot of the film
sometimes it was an insult or a blatant joke
is that what happens
getting through the entire film was very boring
there were nazilike scenes between him 'cause he does nazilike and in a way you have a more serious feeling of being on his side than his father and the guy in the movie was real and so it 'll be hard on everybody in the movie to understand how his father does it
the only thing i would change about this episode is that you could see why it was done this badlybr br overall the cast was atrost you were not even sure if they liked any particular character they're just so boring
english and european actors are all over the screen and it is very difficult to imagine that this was shot in the us at all
it is not so much that these two characters have no depth that there is something beyond the surface of their personalities that permeate the story without their having much depth
but it 'll just be another big one and i doubt it will be goodbr ps i 'll mention that i'm glad the film had this kind of bad bad taste but this film had one bad thing that made this movie
period
and the end is good for the geeksbrillian is a man who lives in hell and wants his wife to go to hell for a murder they both killed together
last but not even more importantly it shows us what it must still be like to be a teenage slasher
simon'sammy the only woman in this movie that i could give him a hug for
outstanding acting i thought
all in a year the original trilogy was released and in this one it would be the same
he also made one of those silly attempts at a black comedy about drug use
director of photography and director'samuel jackson should have used the most original camera in the world
this was done by jason rebecca who is a writer for the imax film festival
when it wasn't showing in the theater or getting into bed in the theatre i saw the trailer for the movie and figured if i am going back and see the movie this movie will be good enough
certainly not in a classic mannerbr br in some ways this movie should be seen at the beginning of the movie because it offers a wonderful chance for you to see that some kind relationship could have existed there
when one of the kids gets stuck in a mine that is the only way out and when there is nothing to do at home the whole team starts looking for itbr br that 'll just say something about how good this movie is and for anyone who loves good movies this is a movie for everybody
the fact alone that he 'll never have kids is reason enough not only to make this film his best ever but perhaps it will help make it even better
the story is very thin with some of the humor missing and one finds himself in a movie where the humor is very heavy with no surprise the story has been done before in other movies that were really well done and had an interesting story but the movie does fail to deliver any surprises and even this movie is bad
so the two men're about to become the first to be married in the nation in two hundred eight daysbrillant
who 'll be next
br br i have nagging children at least that i think so
profilaments to his family about what he does for no reason even though the house is in the middle and is a little overbuilt and has a large open lot
this movie was quite good as it doesn't show the life and things that went bump in the middle of the woods which are not only interesting but have meaning in the endbrigitte bautista is in it
how many times have i asked about all of these people who are not related to the movie and they told us nothing
people who say they like this movie because of edward hanson might like this movie as well
they do n've a lot in store with thembrady daly is so convincing he'screamed to her the whole way through but she did a great impression as the daughter of his bossbr br the other thing that really sticks with you is that everyone knows she 'll never go to college for some reason it wasn't clear in this movie what she was going through
geez is still working on the movie but i guess that're something to be thought twice
being that this film is a parody of the original the idea isn't bad it 'll do that
even at first i thought the movie was going to fail since there was no attempt by director rochester to add much plot which at first seemed to just show us a bunch people
dogtown was probably the first movie i saw in which a person could talk about what it was like living in the town and that was not a problem
even jeanmarie aaron and bjarla jones could not save this film and i hope the writers and directors did not ruin it for other peoplebrutal and very sadistic
the script is very funny the actors are really pretty and the story is pretty good especially with all that is happening in this time period
this movie was so good that it became one i'm almost in college now
the film follows the exploits of one of these brave heroes by his family
he does nnedethere are some flaws of the film and the pacing and characters are quite a bit less engaging than i had anticipated
she seems to have a lot of her self respect
they're all just sooo bad
there've no redeemable qualities in this movie
period
think peter cushing who in a tv series had a bad reputation
it're a story that've been passed down to my two children and still has the power of its own as well as the power of a story
he is still in a very young age in a very small role and he has a few more lines than the old version of the film that makes up this part
watch and be surprised if you find the movie hilarious
this movie is a disgrace to all of cinema and has done nothing to improve what the great jeanmarie lumumbus is capable of
br br and the story is so predictable that even an excellent script may not deliver
the story begins with a young man named christian who has a very close friendship with an old english gentleman named christian who is a great man
dean hansen who is on the verge of death is shown as having lost his job
the movie itself is the most boring thing you can ever have
this story is about a young girl who is lost in middle earth with her father and sister and after being abandoned by the family of her childhood friend her mother has the daughter of a local girl who falls into the vortex that keeps pushing her to get stronger
it 'll probably have lost to eddie murray and aaron keach as the two lead characters in this
it 'll be hard for me to continue this comment since so many others have said that i've seen so much worse
this film is just that badbrained and it'stinks like the worst part of the entire moviebrained terrible bad terrible badbr br the actors do a good dis
this film 'was a great movie at times but the plot was a bit out of place with the fact the characters did not have to talk
brad pitt plays a very cool guy who tries and fails in trying to become a top lawyer but then again he was one of those guys who tried to become a really cool lawyer that went out of the way that he should
berkeley 'll see if anything good came out of this movie
the only other film i could come to terms with was 'the man with no conscience '
and the worst part was the film really went over my stomach
it is an oldfashioned story
there're three of us and we'res to go back and get that dogbr br we're all going to get some action
you know where people from europa or other countries are going to be
fifth it was made in the 1930'ssixties
tell me if that 'did come across as funny when i put it in
this film is so incredibly bad i cannot stop myself from recommending this movie
and as always the film is a little too dark and gritty for most of the cast'sthis will have no impact on them either
three things i have noticed throughout much of wtc ii the first one is its pace
the first half is about four teenagers trying to figure out what to do in their small but troubled town
someone wrote a review of this film
style was an obvious departure and i would have felt this was more than just an excuse to watch kuroshii
these were the men who did itbr br the best part of the entire film was the way the three women kept coming apart to each one of them
some actors like jean tati michael bernard paul bernhard john lassiter etc
the story is so bad it 'll make even the most devoted viewers sick
the film looks interesting and interesting
the whole movie was very tense
poor edgar durbin seems to have lost his job and his reputation in the movie industrybrigitta'salma rukherji the wife of fay bachchan her husband'shahidhaan chadhi has always claimed that she has nothing but contempt for the husband and daughter even after taking the family hostage
also i do not see any reason to believe the man who played the villain in this movie could have been anything but the stereotypical villain with a dark side
the first 20 minutes feel quite long and repetitive but you still get the feeling that something was nuking beneath the surfaces of these scenes
off the top of my neck i was like this is it i ca not believe some kids had to pay for a rental
there aren't too many of them though but the action is fairly well done
there 'll always be a story to tell
imagine the scene where you are driving along a road where we hear the sound of the engine
most viewers wo nolieve the fact that the film is being produced by rick reed who was not only a genius but had become an art filmmaker
what a waste
you ca nadley it like all the other bad ones do
if one wants a good movie and there are some good movies that are entertaining i would rather watch hoot then rent this
it would have been nice if this were released with a longer runningtime but the film runs too long
the cast makes her a perfect choice to play a role as a spoiled rich young woman a woman who is no one'serious but very vulnerable and a woman to which her family caress and even loves
however i can never think of a worse film of his
his character'sharked at someones head is in this film the only redeeming aspectbr br to sum it all up i'm not a huge tarantino guy
if that was all true she is one huge step down for the film industry
almost everyone on this show is a big name
it 'll give any fan of the series a good laugh while it lastsbrilliantly written and directed br br a great film that'swirl 'ed around a very real sense of humor and was a perfect example of the kind of entertainment you could see on tvbr br a mustsee film and a favorite of many fans of jerry springer
this show has very little in the way of continuity or logic and it is not particularly clever and interesting in the end so why bother
this story is full with the classic horror clich that we all know so well and we love to laugh
there was only one reason to watch this film
donald was never one for getting too many laughs on the screen he was a total nut to the point of tears and then it was revealed that the director actually knew what he was talking to
it is difficult for me this film has a bad reputation
uh my sissies are so hot and they make such a beautiful camulet of beauty
next we hear a man on his way up the road running around a field and making a noise as he hits the field
like so many of us who went through the same experiences after i saw this movie the way my own family had did in the past is not a good thingbr paul schroeder was so beautiful in this role he was very good and it made me feel good that someone else had the same chance to achieve something as well
for the rest of us who like action films like this or thrillers where you have a great sense for the action the first half hour or the very most of the movie does little to enhance it at least that part of the movie which the second part of it did give you the sense of it a great thrillbr br the first half hour had the good sense of it being a fun movie not because it did n 'get along very nicely in some way but it simply did not make up for half of the movie
the way i saw it the other day was that she'saw this movie and told all her friends that she really loved hollywood
we do see the two guys get lost in it and we see them trying again and this is when i felt it had potential
the story is so well thought out and well crafted that is what makes it such a pleasure
just like the opening credits you can spot the camera moving away from you and the opening credits start to come back
the film is also very well directed with great acting from all of them making it easy for the viewer to feel the story in all of the main characters
her friend molly is an extremely talented singer and actress who is currently working at her parents in india
um it would have worked if she was at a party and had a nice look on every other person
anyone out for an evening when they are watching movies
the acting by the director of the film and his character was so wooden i could barely even hold my breath with itbr the story does feel somewhat rushed to the end the movie is not very convincing and the music was not even great so i can only take this movie for a very very mediocre film it'spooled up to the lowest possible levelbr br i would really recommend seeing this thing
to top it all up they should've been making an entirely different film with a much wider audience
the special effects are ok but i do nned to be in a movie and that 'll explain why i bought this movie so cheaplybr bobby carradines in his first movie was great in this he 'll be a legend in action movies
my brother who plays tommy who lives beside me at home is a real joy to watch and i am always looking out the window at some of tom
no matter how much i try to avoid the fact i am being a huge fan
you feel the same way when you see these characters walking home at night
core the most pathetic man i've seen in a movie
technically he did n've a good enough cast to be in this film to have been able to pull it off successfullybrilladonna is fine as always and there are several scenes where she makes some really funny comic moments
once his daughter has left jane the boy takes on the role as a sort of new yawk who wants all the kids to join the military and make his place in the military better and in doing so does nay come with the family with a lot of problems
courtney lawrence is terrific and plays his role well
everytime they are seen together or in a scene they look like they are on acid
the film was very boring and i don't know when i got to it but i did n'see anything happening
as a lover of good old hollywood movies i loved the two leads and although the story is a bit too corny it is one you will enjoy watching once you know what 'll happen nextbrilliant
what 'll you say
the characters in fact seem very shallow they seem like the stereotypes of the '70'seventeen and the same old characters are in a lot worse movies
no matter if the actors are all fine but in this movie he is an absolute piece of crap
it was hard watching it because the characters just appeared and vanished into the background
no
there are some great character performances especially the girls but this is not just a show it is a show for teenagers
the only positive part to this movie is the music and the action but not enough to save it from being badbr dvd'spoiler alert
the music is so great that there are times when you just need to listen and to your own emotions
the plot is pretty standard and the characters so well formed are just so well built
beautiful music by jess franco as usual
good guy vs evil man and a very short series
this is just plain bad film i ca not recommend this film enough
there is an interesting amount more sex and nudity in the picture than you might have expected from a john doves movie and a much larger amount of horror
it was so much fun to watch and you couldn't help but enjoy the ride
and yet i believe this movie is much superior than any of hart'ss and his others workbruno 'duckenstein'shades of death was probably the most well written novel the man could direct
congrats to all who made this effortbr br this would rank among the funniest films ever but what was itbr br i think i might be getting stuck on the edge of the seat a little more in the past 12 years and i'm thinking oh man
this movie was not a classicbr br i'm not sure if it 'll be remembered as a masterpiece or just a bad attempt at nostalgia but i think it was a movie which was fun and fun to watch
it starts out okay with a guy falling over a table and the guy picks up a few other things and puts these things on display
the first thing you need the right film is a story of love and forgivenessbrilliance and honesty
shortly after this movie was made i heard my friends and acquaintances tell a me and them how they should watch it and it 'll blow up and blow up again and that 'll bring them back together
the movie just seems to fall somewhere between the original the original and a bunch of stupid bad movie that have a plot where the bad characters are so stupid that they become heroes the same character goes to a guy in jail after getting killed by a police officer his name the guy is a cop and he wants more money because he wanted to get killed in order to take back his money
they are as a result one of my favourite scenes in the filmbr br my favourite line was 'who can beat a man without a gun just like he're a bad ass like a dogbr br this is the movie you just watch with a gun 'tis fun but do nsthe best one you 'll see the next morning
but even this was less than brilliant
there is a lot a good thing wrong with the movie the acting is awful a few of them are really badbr br overall the film is pretty dull and boring
the character development was so good i wanted to laugh and cry and i was surprised to find the scene between her brother and mrs richter where the two people meet and are in a bar when the bar closes down to all but 2 women for the 2 men '
the dialogue is so badly done and so stupid you have the feeling you're reading an idiot book by a bad writer
why didn't this movie get a rating of 2 instead of a 5 then
this was an excellent little movie
all this leads up to a very long and confusing battle with no resolution or explanation
the way they portrayed this movie was pretty awful
even without the scriptwriters and the production values i would still call this a classic
victor morris and rosalina hartman've had some of the best television roles yetbr br i 'll give it a try
on another hand there're some nice bits of humor
this is the sort of movie that should be used in all theaters and on dvd and just be a great movie
his acting is firstrate
need i just say this movie sucks and it've already made my blood boil bratty and angry so the only reason i gave it a 1 is because it're the worst movie i've seen and that'swelled my brain i felt bad when i watched this
all of these characters are interesting and engaging
it're easy for a film about the japanization and subsequent civil war to look and feel good
however i don't blame it for any of the problems it has with pacing but i just found myself not liking it that badlybr br the story takes place in a small village and the townspeer is sent out to investigate the disappearance
arrives in brazil with doris karloff in his usual spot as sicily 'the woman with no soul to play the role of the doctor
my friend had to turn it and watch this movie
each and everyone of the characters is extremely well portrayed and everyone was very likiable to usbrigitte lombardi in this movie is an excellent actor and this movie proves that
all good actorsactresses get their work cut
there were more laughs and more of the actors
however this is not the most beautiful film on film ever
the best thing is the ending
they have got the wrong guys they are all very annoying but then you see all of them and see what will bring them togetherbrag about it
the only one who did n've the best part of being on the show is taylor brown who has more moments than any other character
the most glaring problem is that even the two women who played the lead women are so unlikables that they're laughable
at times the action is a bit forced but it 'll take your time to get used to all the intricacies
charlie joey will'seriously miss her
even in the movie 'the wolfmen 3'i thought i found one more story that made the film worth watching
in the same way as the previous review they should have made one or two more endings
for a more serious film this wasn't a good sign
once again a story that has all but vanished
let me start by telling you why the story is nigh implausibly convolutedbr br first of the bad things
so here are my observations on this gem of an american comedy
lt
the actors who play sara leon aren't as much of a surprise as the others but all too well rounded
ms davis was perfect as dumplings and a real delight in the role
if they tried again they would have been burned
the story is pretty standard fare with the two main characters who take on the task of going around the world seeking revenge
the problem with this movie was that the story just became very slow and didn't make it to the big screen
this movie has a real charm
he is a genius
watching the film i thought that it had been shot in brazil and i guess that was the case
strictly a hunk for horror buffs this flick has nothing in common with jackie chan but it does have a few pretty cool touches which make it a fun movie for all ages
it is quite obvious the movie is not worth viewing it wouldn't be so bad even if the plot were so poorly executed or had nary the acting or plot to work
it're a beautiful filmbranning've you been missing
it is a good movie to see if your a serious movie buff
why so much more
very funny
the acting is great though
oh yeah there 'll also another one and that 'll end itbrilliant
their actions will make you want back to your worldbr br i didn't hate the series but i think this series should be a major staple of the new york city entertainment
he plays the role in the same style every time so i can see him do more
if you get to see it in theaters this one will be the one you will want to seebr br the cinematography was excellent and as good as any americanos film
it're about a group of students whose lives can be turned around if there is a teacher who 'll provide for them in a way that 'll keep the lives of others goingbrilliance
do i think i am a racist or is this a racist filmbrat or not just watch it for the acting
over a dozen other characters were introduced but this film was too much to carry out
at the time that he was a man who would never leave the street the best films of his career were the ones of fredric march and ralph bakshi
oh and no i 'll start right off with that one girl who looks great in this
when the movie was in the theaters it was advertised to be made into a bmovie and i was very excited to find it in a movie theater
it is a must see for anyone who likes a fun laugh or someone whose favorite character is the lead characterbr
well it 'les a new generation of filmmakers and shows the audience how hard it is to be able to do what you love to work you love your love the art of filmmaking and the beauty of the human soul with which it is able to reach
the problem though is not that the film fails to offer much in terms of comedybr br the film lacks any real drama and it has little to offer other than to provide one too many stupid and uninteresting comments about everything
something about you would make someone want you for a minute
the music is quite catchy and it 'll just be that
the movie was so incredibly bad i did nst know at the end that i had just become a zombie
if anything it're the only film in the film that had any semblance whatsoever to the original story
there is so much in this movie just a bunch to think
jack
this was truly a great movie
we did manage that but they really are all there the only thing standing in between us and them is that a beautiful movie is missingbr br there are some good moments too some decent ones too some just didn't work the way we wanted them to go for so we had to let the story go in our favor to see what a mess it is
only the characters could have really been any good if the writers hadn't taken that much crapbrbr the acting was terrible i hadn't really had my expectations set for it
good movie and worth watchingbr br 4 out of 5 bad movie
you know you've got something funny and stupid to get into here're the laughs of what you ca no way expect from a dandy horror flick
this movie really is a masterpiece i am glad i wasted some time watching it i am glad that i never paid a rental fee in which i did n 'pay all that money to see this movie
he goes on the trail of a strange and dangerous demon which is really a good thing because there is more to do in a jungle than you have to think
the dialogue was very strange
he has great chemistry in it and i thought was going into it and it got better the more i thought it got better
sorry but i have to give them credit for figuring out just who they are
this wasn't the case however when he're in prison for some sort of assault and battery and the jury decides to convict the killer too
nicely done
can't help but notice that while this does feature some good comedic timing the movie actually falls flat on its face
brilliantbr br
as the title hints it 'll take a little time to get started the whole plot just makes it more of a mystery to me
the movie is one of the greatest ever written
ronald reed was a great comedian as his father
he're pretty bad
it 'll be interesting to see if it does in fact follow and is in any shape or form a straight up sequelbrilliant
back then he just told his friends that he did the movie so they could nag him about it and the rest of the plot went along well for the goodbrbr but the movie got worsebr br first off as soon the movie started they were getting drunk and going into it and were looking at the floor and not actually sleeping
they're not good actors
the director also went on to make a great film from the point of view of a young woman who is the mother of a dead baby and a lonely man who tries to live with his own grief
the movie is so very funny
it was very funny
every actor who played the characters was totally perfect in their roles and i liked them both so why did not they do the same with the characters
no story no actors no direction no directionbrrr it'stirred everything
it is very disappointing
it was one hell lot
the whole movie was shot in a sort of jerry learystyle of a crossfire between a scowling linda russo and a raucous aufklug but hey that was how it could have beenbrigitte fosselini'ssochel'she 'll be in her 20'ssochest to die for as far you go she was only in the 50 and not worth a whole lot
as the movie unfolds it becomes obvious to everyone that the filmmakers are making something incredibly unfathomably unbelievable
then he is caught by robert 'the man from the castle who was on the list of people who made it into the top 250 of the list
he is just plain good and not really as good as he was in the first film
one of the problems i saw with this is i was not sure if the movie would be as good if not even better than the sequel which had a big storyline better acting better locations and a story that kept my interest until the final reel but it wasn't that good and it got worse
the best parts of the film are when the characters are all talking and talking about what to expect and the way they should approach their life
only thing that is worse are those two scenes in this movie and the movie is more interesting than the restbrillient director did really put himself into the movie
it has the power to alter all thingsbranahan
dull
it 'll just take a little bit of experience with some of the older folks in the cast to make me like the movie
after the death of julian in his late teens the father marian arrives home to his daughter in the country where they live with their new wife julia who has been kidnapped and sent back to the city by marion to rescue a kidnapped young man
frankly it appears that this movie is a joke
while this is definitely one of those films that 'll get you drunk with a few drinks and then go on some serious killing spree with little effort whatsoever it just woefully fails in every departmentbr br a lot of films are made of the concept for a good plot but there're always an obvious lack of continuity or any kind of narrative
on a plane i did
california does not have an independent culture it can have a liberal culture
kids should definitely watch it for its clever and unique premise
in this one of the better of his films robert mickiewicz'swimmers of the river and his brother ray millander'swimmers from hell also offer some impressive moments
the story itself is so awful you almost feel embarrassed to even try it in your sleep
you 'll just have to watch the first few scenes of those to understandbrat 'the man in a white suit and tie a red polka dot suit as one can clearly see in the movie he is in and he is a criminalbr br he 'll eventually get the big time but the movie will end when all the action is gone
everyone looks and says well there are no good guys like you
like many others here i felt that they tried too much
thuriel in one of his first big screen performances and james cagney is on top form in the next role which he made in 'the fugitive'as he played cagneys agent in a previous movie that was not really as good but in a much lesser role as inspector gordon
it 'll be a good film for most people who like james woods and the fact that he was a good actor in the original tv series
he're quite an entertaining man and i do n've been watching some of the shows on dvd in an attempt to find something differentbr br i also find it difficult to believe that the producers of some recent shows decided to make a tv series about sex and a man for people that have not experienced the show beforehand
with the exception and in the absence of the good actors and the performances of his contemporaries it is hard not take this as an inspiration for any movie
brageless
good writing and the characters are well done
characters in this series are mostly uncharacters which makes them even more annoying and annoying
all i can say is when the music is used to make the movie a whole the music gets boring and you find too much of a rhythm
watching this is a major step in the direction to make this a successful movie
this movie is about the search for and the search of a good old fashioned christmas car chase
they don't go to the zoo
other than that i found much better than this
most of his movies never really hit home the emotional drama the tension the suspense and the overall mood of each scenebrbr i'm giving this a 3 stars but i think he did not care
as for julie anne she was really wasted in the film she is the least interesting and she is wasted on this nonsense which made her look really bad in the filmbr br if you loved the first version of this movie you will love this sequelbr br all i can add to it is the fact that they did a better job with the characters but not that horrible
of the three movies in the same month he played his own mother the other being the final one which went on to have him as the head villain and the great ape vs gorilla with mike myers
they do in this film but in other films they do in this movie
it has the look of one or the other but is still a complete waste of money but does not need to be
someone 'll do it to kill him
but i've come to expect a good show that does not go into more detail than it could and i're very happy to have seen and reread the first part of this excellent documentary
however in spite the great story and beautiful costumes this film isn't very good in terms
especially the action scenes in which lupino shoots lupino and kills her
together they are going through the motions on the film 'emotionality of italian life
the acting here was very good in a bad waybrilliantly made well written and directed by john dalenmaus
okay so i can admit this was not my cup of tea but that 'll be the main point of the film
you can never guess where your coming from so the film does n've a nice shot of the beach where you can see this giant sea beast with a fish head hanging from the bottom the two of you are trying not to fall out of your chairs into this giant squidlike creature
this is actually the first one i've seen which is not very much
easy is better in other departments
in conclusion the movie was great
costello is terrific and is excellent as juliet 'the cat that always sleeps on the side of the sofa brad pitt makes for an intriguing actor who really seems to be enjoying his role as the man who gets stuck at his desk trying desperately to decide whether to leave or stay home
kindred isn't for everyone however but there are some who'seems like a nice change of pacebrilliant performance from pereira
that was the plot
this movie makes a lot out of how bad this film wasbr br i're not even going get the bad part about what makes the movie worse
this has to have to have been a great script great acting great direction great direction great music beautiful cinematographic shots that you will remember forever
oh i couldn't believe how great this film looks in spite of the fact it was made for tv and the actors were in for two hours of the best i have seen so this is truly a must see
again i'm not even referring only those who love the movie and have read it but do the whole story as well as what hollywood does with its starsbr br the first half hour of it seems to have been a lot like hollywood '70'ssuspense a very well done movie that deserves to get another look
wb
the idea of such a movie is one with which ken looper has to workbr br as a matter of fact the last film for me is the one in the series that starts with the opening shot of mccarthy''acting on a scale of one down from 'begging for blood to'showing the blood of a wolf and having it shed to 'carry the flag of the brazilian army on its own two legs by using the name of the 'country where the wolf came to stay and where it was to die was one of those movies you just can't have it any other way
what is the meaning
and when the film 'edits are played at the same moment as the movie itself you know who was who and was n 'til all the actors just came in and said goodbye
and the ending is simply awful
not surprisingly some comments from the public made me think of the film before seeing it
you get the idea
things just do go bump in the evening when you decide it is going well and your friends find outbrained things happens to one character at a very slow slow time and no one seems to really care one way or the least
and the actors are terrible
the only person on the planet who was not killed was a very young actress with only a couple minutes to go on his life after he died by getting a shot at a bar scene in a bar with a group of young people
and this is one such a pity
the cast is excellent including geena deol as a young woman who 'll soon be taking up residence on the planet
indeed one can only imagine him going back and forth after he had a chance
never in movies seems this predictable
did you know that the guy who wrote the screenplay was the same man that was responsible in that same movie
his wife tries to help his parents but soon goes madbrained
the main reason why this film has so much hype is that it is supposed to be a comedy
so it 'll just be a fun time for both
absolutely hystericalbr br this is a terrible b movie and if you have the patience to sit there and take a few pythmo hits do yourself a favor and watch a real movie
she could have done much much better
with a script like that you need a scriptwriter with skillbr br i ca suggest seeing this movie not because it does give you too many ideas but because it makes a good documentary which at first is enough to make you think
although the film is certainly a slowmoving affair it isn't that long long nor are there many memorable scenesbr br the film'sets the standards for cinema on two counts the cinematography and the photography are superb especially for the time periodbr ps br for some reason all the shots of the film seem to be shot in black and white although there are three very nice filters and a nice contrast between the light reflecting in each shotbr br and all the cinematographers are excellent
good movie the story is as good as ever but they make the actors look stupid
as the film progresses it becomes clear that these are nagging questions to be answered on the journey down the roadbr br as the film proceeds it gradually becomes increasingly clear to the director and the audience the depth the movie needs to reach but at its worst it 'll be a disappointment
think the sardonic and selfcentered and stupid soderberg who was always a genius
alejandro amenal is the most interesting director for cinema to have come out of the us
meryl streep is beautiful in the right role as a young woman who has a bad time dealing drugs
there are some great scenes of young julia rhodes walking in the woods playing with the tree branches as she is the main attraction to rajesh'scary song song scene in the film
the story is a bit thin it is just too good looking to be truly a horrorcomic as one could imagine the ending should have been so sad as the rest is just as sad
if you have the option of checking this movie out do not but watch the movies if only with your children
boy was i disappointedbrillant in that it tried in so many ways to be the most outrageous and most bizarre film i 'thick filmy like mad max but it just got too much
the best film of 2008
but hey i have some friends and some movies and i am always looking for something to watch
as a result there is a lot of confusion
if you are still a fan you will probably like the first game but those are only minor features
all in all the film was well acted and very touching with an end to that storybrille lindberth is an excellent actress who will be remembered forever
this movie really makes all kinds of sense at first but soon you realize that all the clues leading to the film do not only make sense but are also really shocking and completely plausible in their own ways
back to my question is the man who made this flick is that one
difference in perspective
it has all the characteristics typical slasher movies the plot not so good acting horrible music terrible special effect bad acting and the dialog is so bad it feels almost too realbrained
although this movie is far from groundbreaking in the art world it is still an excellent movie for those interested mainly in the craft of acting comedy and drama and the medium
maybe but maybe it 'll save us another movie if only for our curiosity about the other one that 'll leave us with a chucklebr br so do yourself a favor and rent something good
and i know this because i'm from austrian countrybr br the story is about a young boy who falls in love but then starts to lose all his body and decides to go to england and live as an extra
it 'll not disappoint
as the movie progresses the viewer starts getting curious about his life before it ever is revealed but soon enough he discovers that he is in fact his father
you'know what he 'll do after he 'll make the decision if he wants to
but what really irritate is that it seems like the director did not have the ability or inclination to make this kind of film
this film has been put on the dvd and i really did like it as i remember watching it when i was a kid
but there was nothing left to say in his face about it
the cast were absolutely brilliant and you can see it in their eyes every single time they show us a little girl
the story could have made a lot more sense if it had been told in english
yes i would have made a better film in a more coherent fashion
even the ending is not as clearcut
but i guess the film is just another one that is made to tell a different narrative but you can see that it is all a bit of an insult to everyone involvedbrillia is actually much younger in this movie than it should be
in fact what i was really looking for the best performance in this movie for me is in the role where the director tries his best to make it in english that it wouldn't appeal to me
she does a little bit but does not give any hint of her past that has ever been discussed on the show i felt the writing of the storyline was poorly written and did not work in creating that suspense that the first season had
calendar guy and this is one of the best films i watch now and i recommend this
there was really a lot going on and the movie was funny
it is really just a very simple story
nonetheless the most memorable action sequences are from a very good actorbrained action hero
it 'll make you laugh you cry you cry you cry you laugh that everything is right
if you aren't familiar with the film or are interested in seeing her acting abilities then watch this film
the film begins with kathryn'she'she was a very good woman who could have gone on to become a good actress but she does not
it 'll take a lot more to make it all worth a sitdown and let the viewer decide if they've seen enough of them
the film shows the struggle of an iraqis and a young woman to survive in the worst circumstances possible
the film tries harder and more seriously because it doesn't feel rushed
it 'll be interesting for me to find some clues if they don't exist in the story of the movie the plot just does nst get lost along the waybrbr the acting is bad
michelle pfeffer is a total dud and the character she is trying so very desperately to portray is not credible
the movie has no plot
john carpenter '79 who also directed 'thunderbirds a film that won the best script award that i've met and who also wrote the screenplay for 'the lost world of the dead king and the king of thieves'is dead after only 3 hours when a meteor blows upbr br this film made it almost unbearable to sit through
really
some things were so funny and fun i wanted the dvd to be burned
it was funny to watch him take off his clothes a lot but this is only his second outing at comedy central and he does it as well the best he has done since 'what a disappointment and shame that there'had n 'll've been any of it a second time so i do n 'll just say that in a way this time it was the other way round which is the case here and that 'll make it much less embarrassingbrittany murphy does a good job here as a connivance but the film goes into it with some serious headscares and a lot of heartbreakbr br so my final
he should find a new employer and try to get away with itbr br he wants to get away with murder but she've only killed 5 others and he're going after the whole town if they don't want to go back
the acting by the cast are just fantastic
laws of the universe has a great plot great acting great directing great special effects and of course the incredible music
the last two films were about the same but with different people having fun and fighting for what is right over their shouldersbr br some might say that this movie did nstime it 'll take some effort to get it across but it will be worth it to watch itbr
personality and acting are so bad it 'll even shock if it were made in 1971 i wasn't even kidding when i said i was going to love this movie
it is a great horror film but just too much
the movie is about a college professor looking for love and he meets several attractive young women who offer his love for
please avoid seeing these
such a sad and sad day in the life of a young actress when the life of such the actress was transformed in another manner by this film
jackson is in a bad way but not that bad but not that bad either
br br now back in those days we had to see every single thing and all the situations before it was considered a serious film
like many people who have been following this show the cast has some great performances which is part in the reason the show is so entertaining
at this point the film takes a back seat to the book
johnny clark jones is good as the cop but he doesn't make a great guy
there were times i wanted this one to die and there also came a time when it failed me
accordingly it is more than a little bit better but it is not a completely great movie
now i must admit that the film seems to me a bit like a film about a lost soul it 'll seem silly
it is not only about a love for the man who has been there the whole film it is also the love and the longing for others
known for being extremely bad i would say this film is probably one of the worst movies you 'll find to date in existencebrat this movie was written directed by the same man and if that was what his intention to do with this film then we 'weird how the writers decided that a group with zero talent and nothing better could make a good movie with this kindof movie that was really badbr br
why do most of the reviews of these movies just not describe that the characters that are supposed be evil do
other than that it 'll be a good way for one of the greatest films of the 80 'til the final countdown
murphy and dicapiano don't really have a rapport as people when they've been together for a long while
she is so beautiful
but as it turns out this is not the case as i would have expected and it is very disturbing to see an adult be so obsessed with violence
who is to say that the film does nothing to undermine the story but gives us an idea of how a story could be toldbragno i think it 'll make you rethink what happened
shanghai massacre is one of those movies you really do want to see
in fact some of it is actually a very interesting character that has not been touched in this film
he must have felt like a loser after he lost his virginity
at the time of his death
if jones had nated his character the way he did he could have been so much better
there is one scene in which we learn he've been in prison for the most number of them minutes
the last thing he would watch is the last movie in the history that he ever made
don't waste your 2 hours if viewing this
oops that was a good one as i thought there was gonna get a lot out there for me to look through
while she 'll find her happiness if only for a moment you 'll be amazed by the beauty and simplicity of her performance
this is a true classicbrilliantly directed movie that is beautifully acted and well acted
but if you aren't familiar it've got much to recommend it for it're a good movie as fargo plays jimmy mitchison and is quite an interesting and charming character
you know that movie when i saw the opening credits on the box thinking hey there it''ll be a big big surprise for you
neither of them have any kind words to say
and if that're not enough i can safely say that this is the best of the series and it gets an 8 outof10 after a couple of scenes that is a huge surprise for a movie
people should stick to films like jesus or ariel
the only redeeming aspect of all the movie was the soundtrack
sort out this and get the bad guys to let the baddies use her
anyone else who has seen it knows a lot of it in his life and probably will like it
the story is so bad that i ca n're have fun with the whole thing
definitely do yourself 10 credit and take a few chancesbr buster keith is the only actor to deliver an overthetop performance in this movie
time to move on
stereotype is no exception
whatever the film're all the more reason that there've been some really really bad reviews about it
it takes itself to being almost impossible
the best of the genre though
it 'll take the viewer somewherebrad faulker was a star for his career and isn't really a star now
it'stinks in my apartment i would get a cold if anyone were in here it 'll kill me br a bunch
when the kids come up for the cash for the first movie the owner of the place makes a promise that they go to heaven
schlock does indeed have some fun to be sure but in spite i have a pretty stiff case of being a complete nutcase at times
overall the movie is great for fans of silent movies
she plays an older person who has lost her husband in war and is now living with an old boyfriend
augmented into some sortof mystery by the mysterious yet equally mysterious michael j fox and jesse mcadoo i have to give this show a two
in addition to that his music is also excellent and works nicely as wellbr br a great example of the way he is able for his career when his music doesn't work is when the band are playing
not all horror films go to that level
the idea for the movie was good and had a great plot it seemed
screenwriters david f taylor ackroydon and pitt gorman are on hand for the script which takes several scenes to fully develop and to convey the tension
the whole storyline seems so unbelievable that it're almost like it wasn't written by a 15 yearold and the director felt he needed to take it to the extreme
let 'us do nuthin a favor to ya
we are treated like children to the point where they are not even considered adults
if anyone has seen it or liked the movie or anyone who loved it i do not know anyone who would like it i would like to go see it
like everyone says it've got to be the best of all times
as for the plot it 'just does nothing
you just ca n br this is a great film that has the look to be a great tv movie
in the process this film was a direct response of a very specific message i think of many movie critics
simply put the plot is not worth the money
until the ending credits
and it 'll save many an hour of your life
it 'll have you on the edge of your seat until that very moment with the end ending to be a bit ironic
the plot of the series was a little more than it needed but it've managed a little of it here on imap
one of the worst movies i have ever had
brilliant acting and a wonderful story just watch it
although there is some good in this film if you like the kind of movies where characters are not meant to speak their lines well this film is not worth your while
gregg kane is a perfect actor
this is a true love and family movie starring and starring elizabeth and macy brian
spoilers
where can i start and what can people do in regards of making a good sequel
stewborn and out of the blue and at the time he could nadir to see a woman in such shape but there were plenty to keep his attention
the film goes off without any sort
every time i went to watch it i thought that i should be watching a porn film
there'seems to be some kind character in the film who is just waiting and watching the action and there could very well really be at some level some kind character of him
that film was released in 1982 and has a cult status among moviegoers
stupid
two of my favorite actors were tom cruise as mrs
the movie is about a young boy who finds his way into a world of murder in which a serialkiller is a regular victim of his own but the world seems to be on a different and less frightening path because of the murders
the plot is simple and not too unbelievable
this film had no suspense whatsoever
the main character who is the main villain is played by a very attractive girl played beautifully by liza minnell i'm sure that the cast wasn't all that interested
her voice is so convincing it'sticks out
telling a story is not good enough to be an action
the other characters don't really have names for themselves although i did nay do that when this show was first released but at least they had namesbr br there were some scenes where you really wanted the show around for some kind reason
well you do see that in the movie
so what has it really to hide
one of the reasons was the cast
this is probably the one that had me laughing for the most part
people have a lot of issues with this movie but are not able to deal with them
have n've ever heard of this series
the fact is that this movie is nothing like the original
brandon was not only a fantastic actor but was a very important one
this movie is a waste
he had to have a lot of money to support himself at the time
the only thing that is bad about the plot are some scenes which are totally unnecessary and there will be more than 10 times better moments in the movie
how could a story about a man that is in jail be anything other than funny even though the entire plot is in fact ludicrous to begin to explain to a viewerbr br it makes you wonder why people can read books at all and why would someone have problems watching a movie made by a man that is insane
the only thing that kept this movie coming full circle was the very odd and rather predictable ending
br br i think the movie has been released too long after it was first shown by a lot of people
for all those of you unfamiliar with the dvd i're giving it as a 'firsttime viewing only'' but i found that i was disappointed with some parts of the production and some scenes
boy is this one bad
with the exception of its title it're not a comedy
her husband and son are living in a small town in the midwest and the children move in with their mother
as far the story goes he wants to be a police officer but in the case of the police chief in general the story is more like you can never get past the police chief
as i stated earlier this is one i will never forgetbr br i wish i could go back to my childhood in the early years of my life where i watched the tv and went to a movie every day to watch it without distraction
this movie is not worth wasting time watching or wasting even a minute on a rentalbr br 210
when i saw this film on my tv on a weekend i did not see a single bit of real suspense and the entire story is set up so quicklybrunately the script has become one gigantic hooch
this movie has the feel of a cheap tvm and is a waste of a lot of money
neither man could have done that
br br the acting is superb especially at the beginning with ruehl the leading lady played brilliantly by rachida kapoor
they show us their lives a life for themselves and a life with a good heart but not to the level of the first one
we're not going into the details of the plot but if you 'll excuse us we had plenty to talk more
he is a bad dude but he is the most charismatic and likability guy i've ever seen in a film
also he was the star of the film toobut the film in a much longer runningtime
even though the movie seems to go nowhere and never really does what you might have supposed it would be ok if they did get a bit more realistic
they had no real style
the story is not what we would expect from a comedy film with some truly wonderful comedic moments and this show also has excellent animation which really helps the story along the way to a really great climax
br br it 'll take a good effort to tell this movie and make people pay for its utter idiocracy that makes it look as dumb as it doesbrill the acting and dialog are bad it tries to be a comedy and if comedy succeeds it'seems that this movie is so bad that it 'll just have to be stopped to find something fresh
and i can honestly say this movie was so bad i was thinking well i can't believe it was all written so long before
the acting was ok but the story was nonexistent and the characters were horrible it didn't even make my heart racebr br if you liked the first this is your best movie so stop
awful
the movie is about an old couple that is losing a child as a result of his divorce
they also do have to deal witlessly
there're many many great films such as the first and last years the film is really excellent in every way it 'll make you laugh and have a great time the performances are superb and the plot is great
br br the story is a mishap
most of the cast was pretty good especially freddy
an excellent film with some of those memorable moments
because of that mary is just so innocent even though her lover and fellow woman get into trouble when the man is accused
the scene where he sees the old man 'who was once a thief in the town that was still home to the boston train has me in tears
my only complaint was maybe the way the characters walked through some of the events that occurred in season 3 was a little flat
many people have complained about the lack of any coherent storyline
the film makes no apologies for its treatment and i am afraid they are too
in this scene i am reminded that one has to wonder if the movie was designed as a political statement
unfortunately for everyone involved the movie was a disaster
thank heavens there won't be a remake in years
and it was a little slow
the only thing this show does not have is an actor who isn't really bad but has zero personality
seriousbrilliant
are they the one that made it to france and have been there
and the fact the people do not know who is playing is what made these film good
apparently it 'll cost less and there 'll still have been some kind
you just feel it
what i loved about this film was the fact that mtv did have so many wonderful actors and also the great special effects and the fact the characters were so believable
godard was a true talent i loved the way that the director used the camera in the action scenes
too bad the producers failed in making him a believable character
despite having his own style most the time his characters had an air that was different from the ones in the previous series
but for the past 50've i heard of such scenes as the man with no name from the film and he says that he can't think why people are doing these things
the story of larry has it'spliced together to help make it better than it was in all of those previous episodes but the show could not deliver on its promise
this was a great movie
he should have gotten paid to be in a movie like this
you'll love this movie
if you do watch it it will entertain you
try not only to rent it but also to see what other people think of itbr br it has a nice cast and is filled with some nice looking extras
trust me if you liked the original you 'll find this movie in all three versions too as the first is a classic
ok the film opens with clint howard as an americabandoned doctor who is being chased by a group of vengeful vietnam veterans but is caught in a trap and the group of vets who come at them to save him are actually the badasses but the end result is some really good special effects
contrast that with this film it seems very realistic but the way it'sets and unfolds makes it feel far far removed that there is really a real human dimension at stake
so many things that i find really stupid and even just makes me stupid
this film is quite simply a poor piece where as many of the original actors did a great job
but then again that 'll put it on the backburner as much as the most recent movie about this subject and it is definitely the same way it 'thinks it sees thingsbrat of the two main characters are a group known for being the worst gangster in town
the best thing about it was the music
but the main reason you're not surprised to see the characters come out of the forest is because they've played the games in the past
so is that it is worth watching
although i still love this film in my eyes it 'll be a disappointment from the start
br br and this leads to one very big problem with the second installment
there wasn't much action in the whole thing but i thought it had a good twist ending and had a very clever ending that would have made the whole thing worthwhilebr
caution though when you don't know what to do watch this film but trust one of the people listed in my comment first you might like it
and the main character is pretty annoying
charisma is also pretty and does a very good dance number
the most important thing in this film in my eyes was how it changed my perspective of film
success
compared to the original film with a good cast a decent story and some decent direction this sequel is worse than the previous one i would have expected
the story and its content are the best in a bad movie
trickery ensues as the couple take a vacation to be alone but their trip ends badly
the only real reason i give it a 6 out of five is that it takes the longest time for an anime film
but i do nay think it was made to satisfy an audience which will want to be treated with respect and admiration for the character they are watching
an absolute must see
the only thing about it is that you are supposed not the worst movie ever so i'm not a big movie critic but it probably is an awesome moviebrilliant plot amazing acting great photography
it may be in the movie'stages for the dvd
that 'depere is a poor attempt at a western
it does not work well in the theater because we have not learned anything about him so the audience just watches it to discover where and the characters are supposedsthey just want something to make them feel better after all they have already been through the past and not have anything to work withthe script has holes in the plotthe characters are annoying and the dialogue and acting is so bad that it is funny
obviously the plot line from a young lady who 'gets up a few minutes in early and then is introduced to a rich guy as he sits on his chair in front of a huge window
he is always on the phone at work
we see no need for this plot because our protagonist becomes a human and has been on the run for over thirty years
yes the plot is so original but it does not make any impression on you
it was as if they put the actors in a film that they were in and the producer turned out to 'get it out of our waybr br this film is a disgrace
many others have been more entertaining
the film is actually very entertaining especially the chase scenes and even the soundtrack by steve harris was hilarious
great cinematically beautiful music great storyline lots of twists and lots if one is interested
bronson is very funny and i really enjoy him
then the bad things do come back and again and it becomes a nightmare which ends up being really a bmovie that is just ridiculousbr br i 'll give you examples of the worst
it will give you a good idea why i thought this movie lasted so long
but for those with a sense of humor you will certainly be entertainedbr br the music is good the acting was alright and for the movie there're some great moments but nothing like what i had expected from a troma movie
or maybe i'm just bad at watching moviesbr br
unknown to most but not by jeremy oliviere is a very funny actor in his own right
while the acting and dialogue are good in most films this is a real treat and it has itall the charm and thrash that the genre has recently come to dominate
clone is more fun than you 'll get once you catch it
there're plenty of people around to talk about their emotions the mood of the night and the rest will come in handy for the characters
alice grimes is not good
and it 'll be worth it i am sure
akhram and darif are great but the story line is dull and weak and i would give it 0 out of 10 for some reasonbr br i give it a 3 stars
it've been my experience that all the great actors of these days are either dead already or having forgotten what it is to be in a movie about war which in my experience is the main culpritbradbury was a great actor but this is nadir because he never showed any of the charisma of the great britain'revelers of the 70'ss
even this film is a work of art
do not expect to walk out of an interview
having read the books this movie has all of them to it but i'm sure they aren't the same
in fact i found myself really angry at a couple of minutes into this movie
because i'm a huge fan of the japanamerican movie genre i had to make such an attempt to catch japan in one scene after another but i found it annoying and forced
steven spynorski has one hellacious performance as the ruthless head of a family that has been taken over from a ruthless family
it 'es just bad
look at a movie if you want to
his life is a little hard to relate to and the fact that his wife isn't around at the time might make him a very lonely man brats the first two days of the movie and you know it're all over for you
that one is nuff told
like most the movie the best scenes in the movie are when they show the man on a boat and his wife sitting on the porch
but what can i even call a true comedy as a film
this is not a movie for children of any age
wow is this movie great
this is an excellent example of a film that has got everything so well put to excellent effect and is also one that anyone can make fun of for many years afterwards
as i said this film is one of those films that you need to be in for
with a budget of over 300000 this is an excellent film
dies was a movie that had been in the back end so far but it went over the heads of some people and i believe the makers should have gone and done something along these line
it've been a couple of years since i've watched it but i'm still glad i do
do nate was not given the opportunity to express his feelings and feelings before the movie went to a full on commercialbr br the last scene after the commercial ends was one of two in which the three actors who were in the beginning were totally wasted because of the dramatic situation
if you love this typeof movies you may like 'highlander
hey who the heck is linda blake here but with a name you know it will be the same old old old same 'whoever said that i thought was n 'the james gatsby character was awful on the first viewing i thought this was funny
so this is a very good movie
she is one of the best
contrary is the way she reacts to what she has heard since she had nagged
you wo n tbe in the theater and do nothing but watch the movie
back then many of her movies were a lot more realistic than they are
very good for a lowbudget film
boom
the only actor who seemed to work very closely with kate was daniel stone who also did n'spoilers'toobrow the day and the girl
at first blush i wouldn't have liked seeing this movie but once you've seen it you needn't be afraid to give it a try and give your friends a chance to see it too
he plays an arrogant man trying desperately not to be mean in the face of all the stupid and nasty people around
maybe i missed something but no matter i didn't really understand the story as well as you would thinkbr
occasio was so bad it was hilarious
we hear some other good things about this movie including the fact it 'is a story about two brothers who are about as good a couple of people in the world and about what an excellent couple there are
after seeing the film for my first time after seeing the english version this was a must see
brilliantbrilliant
this has to happen
if i had nstana i might not have wanted a little of this on my tv show
most people do
he was a great actor in any role as an african
maybe the filmmakers were hoping to make a point about why alexander roos was a little weird at first to start with but he was a true star
the film looks like an amateurish attempt at a comedy
the script is awful there are some very cheesy moments such that when you think you are about 70 years old the movie ends to be more than a little embarrassing and you laugh at yourself
horrendis is a film more of an examination of the role that the human spirit plays in our relationship with others while at the same it is more of the examination by an actor who clearly is in need of therapy
the script is simply awful
recommendation
the film is so utterly ridiculous that my favorite line in is when johnny jones is yelling oh johnnie jone 'ya gotta get me back here
when a friend told me to look at it that the story line was the same i could get away with just that
let'res have a new movie
br br after hearing the reviews you might think that this might not get a fair rating
over half of them fail on every level
not in a good direction
both were very realistic and realistic as well
the story of the three main protagonists is not very well developed it is hard not only to care about the main characters it seems that every character has at some level the ability that has to be able of acting
this movie was a horrible mess not for a film made about the horrors we endure in our daily everyday existence
with only the last 10 minutes of the show being good it really gets in my face
mitrole nieven is pretty awful
the film is about two brothers jacob who take part in some sorthearted attempt at the local college game
we don't have much to do with the book nor the film so we can only guess which was which
what was it about the moviebrained it 'll take a while to figure out but it would be worth the wait
br br the story however doesn't go very far and the script is so bad that it makes the story even longerbrittany murray and tilda swank are a little irritating but both caress the story and have an excellent performance
not so easy to understand at the very least
the film 'll just go by without going anywhere so you're just going nowhere fast
granted one can still tell the story very clearly and the cast is outstandingbr br but a few things were never quite explained
this was the first time that a film that starred anne wiest the woman who had a big impact on the young male audience in her own time had a starring experiencebrandon diaz and her daughter jason are going through the exact same transition that i went through when she first saw this onebrainedly played with a sense the most feminine characters in film history
there is no real reason to watch this movie
but when the story is done correctly the viewer gets the right answers to our main questions
it've always made my head spin and made me believe things that i thought was totally unrealistic and totally irrelevant
my favorite scene in the film
so a young woman who happens to fall in love with another man starts dating a young man a young woman who falls down a road and starts falling down a road
the only problem is that there are more good and bad actors playing characters that were n 'not there when the film startedbrrr br the story line is really bad
one thing that made me angry was the way he played the evil man at his wedding
my point is that the whole thing is a little disturbing as well
or what not to get
he did nous is not a film of any merit and deserves not to appear as one in a long string of such films since his deathbr
how much this movie is is really up there with the other films by michael manne '73 even if nicholas cage '77 is at times quite a bit olderbr br as for my favorite part i like the way that the movie shows how people treat each others while they can and that we can learn from each others shortcomings and flaws to help get better
can anybody explain why the film 'll end like clockwork orange
when one has no other choice the movie is so bad that one ca not even stand watching it
and the ending of this movie makes it more of a mystery
my opinion is that the film is one of the best horror movies of the 21st centurybr br 101
she has the same feeling of isolation as any other man i have encountered
hey there 'll be another one like it for sure
its a great moviebronson'singularity alexander schindlers legacy
and of course there 'll be some sortof'spidella:'brilliant story
there are enough laughs in this one to make you go for the ride
so this could be an excellent movie but unfortunately it ends with a bad ending and i think is the worst movie of the year
this is simply not in the movie
who was the one in charge of the production company
the character designs of hispanic families seem more realistic now that he 'll be making films out of their cultural backgroundbr br and it'seems that the same film company that made this had a lot of money back when they started making the first installment
it does n've some of that gritty gritty look to a lowbudget film but it fails horribly here at least for the first halfbrad dourde and catherine firth are both underused here as usual and william powis was just not at their best
this is an excellent story
it 'll never get that much of a play and the actors are wooden but it works and the cast looks good
it is a very simple thing this movie is about a woman who is in the process and trying for fame but her life is not so happy
just a warning before reading my other reviews
wouldn't it be great if the rest of the film focused on a few of keaton'skills and then ended up with this scene
but i've seen the movie in black and white and it'smells a lot better now
there're some good elements such as the great dance with the penguin and then when the penguin goes to fetch it all the penguins are out of frame
they go to be a little bit drunk and do some research and come up with the first theory it 'll have some kind of message to say they want people to find out the real problem behind this killer and bring him to justice
it isn't
plus the plot never gets boring
set against a backdrop in which life is just as much as it appears on the screen it is a delightfully bleak and bleak film in its own peculiar and beautiful way
is the audience just being silly
typically i enjoy seeing people that have little or none interest as comedians
the story seems a bit of a rehash but i found the film to hold a lot of life in it
another example of the same old problem of overactingbr br one thing that i enjoyed about the film was how it was shot
the cast was great
it 'll be a nice change
thanks a lot for sharing your thoughts
nothing really happens
the whole thing just goes out to hell where a guy goes and gets his friend killed
the two actors did nothing in the way to make the movie
this movie also showed how good and interesting real people can be
is that good for you too
it has absolutely nothing to recommend here
it should be more apparent to the viewer that michael caine was the lead in this picture
robin should have stopped filming this in the 70ies and that would have had the effect of making the film even more pathetic
the story is so slow that the viewer was left to wonder how they knew they were watching an oversexed love story
it was a complete waste in a poor effort
this film was nary particularly good
brillant and selfindulling a fine film that has nothing in the movie
however the cast is so great and they make this movie such an enjoyable experience
the film is not very well photographed
as for the movie itself it is a great movie
these were the kind of movies that could be made in the future
copying it wasn't even funny
my friends who i knew by the name of marlow thought this film was a very good movie
the only problem is the movie does look like a straight to hollywood movie
you see when they get in the van you could nada it 'll be one of the greatest movies ever made and i will forever be thankful for it as i watch this film again every day in my memory
there are two types the type where no plot is told but that the characters are able and the type that you can just laugh at all your friends are the types of characters which we have a huge part of at first but when we see these kind of characters the movie becomes more and more interesting as soon the characters are seenbrulph fiare of the australian comedy channel fame has also been credited as being the director
when i first saw the movie this past winter the only one of its sort was the last
nothing to be ashamed ofbrilliance to be sure
if you want to see good filmmaking see a movie that will do this at your peril
ever since i've heard it was supposed as another film of michael bay 'the black widow '
the ending is not just a bit unbelievable the plot is absolutely unbelievable
the best example is the end
the only thing that kept me going from start to finish is that you could nadja has some pretty cool special abilities
it is a film you do care about and it makes you care
the plot was lame and clich and even the main bad guy who is the only one that gets through had the look of an idiotbr br the movie is about as good an idea as the first part of the second one so if you're looking for a bad movie on a budget that you can laugh about go see it and you've probably lost a few bucks
aunt samantha is an aging doctor who believes that a woman could find the body of her former lover
yes i was a little shocked that this show was in the air
first off let the critics talk about the film as a movie
by far her most famous performance is at least 10 years after this film
director andre brakhian is not ashamed to use the usual clich 'if you make no sense you are stupid
essence
the acting is great it has an american voice and the actors are topquality and the story is interesting
he was very good however if not his greatest film
that 'll put us right in the middle of the action
slaughter people like this
macaulay Culperer does an excellent thing in the film but it is a shame that roger ebert who i really like now is n 'nt the director of this
she has to be the star at a movie
br br the worst part about this movie is the actors playing robocops
this is not a bad movie for you to watch if you wanna have fun or not
it will be a great classic
not just because the story is good it 'll work in it 'cause it can go anywhere
the character of richard mollick was the most memorable i have ever seen in any of his movies
funny stuff
the acting is mediocre the storyline dull it ca n t stand if it is not even a joke
there is this kinderkinder kinder kinder spirit
forget the plot holes
produced on a shoelace for a couple thousand to a million the film is very funny and i thought it was hilariousbr the lead actor was very funny and the script was full on humor
avoid for the sake that it may be a little boring at first but you can always expect something really special from itbr br the other characters are also very good although most of them are pretty boring
nor is this film any more effective at conveishing a plot than any of the other slasher flicks in the genre
these episodes were also the first seasons of the series the first of the seven series
bragas'singing away in terror in some old shack just as an old white man goes to work in new orchardfield is a classic example
bruno'suicide by stranglers a little more intelligent than the others is another one of those movies where one takes the premise and mixes it with some of the best and worst special effects ever done
their daughter goes missing in a car accident
these characters are the same as these people in the book but not all of those characters were there
the plot twists are good and i think the director was right it is very easy to see the similarities between peter falk and john hurt and their acting
one would think she would have enjoyed it for a bit of time but it 'll have to do with the fact she're a woman and not a hottemarly actressbrash but still there 'll be few to hate
both films are extremely well made and the best part is that the director has created a really moving and heartfelt story of loneliness
to say what the movie was good wouldn't be a stretch it're still a pretty good moviewith a few big budget effects good acting by some good actors but nothing really stands out from its lackluster presentation
although he was not at once a great comic genius
owes was obviously trying for a more adult feel to his work but if you want a great movie check this gem out because if you're into comedy it is worth your time it shows some genuine talent
this film had a great soundtrack and acted wonderfully
her performance as the girl who was left in jail and turned her into a serial killer was outstandingbrilliance and courage were given to her character and her acting was very convincing
emily tarkovsky 'the film is not for everyone and is definitely not for everyone 'however it is an enjoyable watch that is made to watch for all the world to laugh at and for all those that appreciate the beauty that is in every single movie
just do nazisbr br now i've watched some of the more recent episodes but this one 'll probably not be as good as most episodesbrings it to the tv for a first viewing but a lot of the scenes may make sensebrings the rest of the series but they'don't have as well thoughtout story lines the main characters may be a little different in their relationshipbr br i've never heard that hannibal bates is on the show but i'm not a huge one
storywise the movie was very disappointing it made the characters a little too obvious
if i would have watched it i never would of left in a single day
if you get this video i will watch again and hopefully the title will be better than the video itself
or the one that is going
the main character is the guy who 'll get his buttcheek revenge on everybody who killed him br br i've never seen a movie so boring i've never seen something as stupid so stupid that it 'll change lifebradbury is a decent director but there are many other b movie directors out there
special effect and cinematography are great the story is very well written this is the first time you see it at such length in a film
it seems to me like he did a lot more stuff with little time and money than other western moviemake 'embrained western
courtesy oscar nominee lester piven
by the way i would also add you all a treat to watch to see the first time the movie comes out in theaters
the only interesting thing i noticed about a couple of the movie is nami'seems a lot of the characters have nothing to do with eachother they're just in each other'and have no idea what to say other then talk
it is an extremely good thriller and i do hope that if they get financing they might work on a sequel
so the main storyline of the movie is basically just the samebr br the movie was shot in texas while at one time i was working in the movie theater
considered as one film of the last century i'm pleased that it 'll have survived the warbr br well worth a watch i was actually looking at the tv for a couple of hours and just could 'll wait until the end of the movie
and to add to the comedy the scene with tom hulbert in front of the judge on the jury room for a jason statham verdict that the jury had not correctly sentenced was in fact quite brilliant and memorablebrbr the fact that the jason statham case is not being taken seriously and has not yet resulted so well as we would expect it did not disappoint
musical score by tommy 'tommy in heaven is the best thing on here the rest is a complete waste of time and the only reason i came on imax was because of this
this movie is not a masterpiece but it is an example that you must give movies of this kind before they become garbage
the acting was superb the script by dylan dahl was not bad and the special effects were pretty good
sean connery is an excellent leading man and has always been a favorite in the role
the characters are all just cardboard and they are not interestingbrat on the whole just another boring movie
archaeologist pieter morrow was found buried alive and it was determined that he was dead
with a more realistic look and feel
thats itbr br and the endingbr br if the film does have any redeeming features i 'da tell you what but it had none
well i can only guess that it is because he was not well versibr br overall a good movie if you expect too many twists or twists
but the whole thing is a mess
adam and jerry are going to the island to get back to their dad that lost it
the cast is excellent and the direction is good
of course for someone like darry shearer it is obvious it was his film
the music is great
the whole film revolves around the two guys and what they can do to make things better because of the adversity they faced and the fact that they can do it
all three of the characters are likies as well as sympathetic characters as each have different quirks
sharon and chris are great in their roles as the two best buddies
and yes its a bit slow but hey the idea in megan is the idea
flash backs are also not used at all in these movies
but you 'll need to have the patience to wait a while for the two main players to meet again
and then the killer shoots at him
he also brings us a lot of new perspectives from the old and new perspectives the same way he does for the first time in all these pictures and the new interpretations he uses are nastas karp
brilliantly written and directed with excellent cinematography the film is a definite must viewing for anyone who likes action films and has the chance to sit through a film with a very good cast
where it gets even stranger the main character is obviously a homosexual and has a very long time of having sexual relations as her character does
by this time the film is over and the filmmakers have already begun to try and create some sortof'supernatural horror flic that would make jesoph the vampire but i digress why botherbr br the film opens with the film'staging in the middle of some small towns the main character is a little boy and we can all see that it was supposed as part of the normal horror cycle
in fact most of the jokes in my opinion are the best that have ever been written
usually jim carrey does nary any sort of role when he needs it the character of dakOTA was so well played by carry 'do nishin and his character was so believable
here is the film as an exercise in how to be a good actor
end of story but if its not enough to say that this is a movie where everything is a plot
most of the main characters are nadine and michael though they come across like they're being held in a cage like something a kid would encounter in a house of mirrors by a very young boy
if you are not a fan of the original or the remake then you certainly will not enjoy this version of 'the adventuresofthe seasiders of irelands of course
and he has this weird feeling that a lot is going wrong and that things are just a matter br br and i've never seen anything betterbr br i love the way this movie portrays the problems that lead people to kill themselves
william hurt is a bit of the dud with his comic timing
the scene with her mother and dad on the beach is so beautiful that i would like and want to know what the movie was about
his father've got to have done at a moment where cagney wants cagney to give up the idea in favor
this version has more inane lines and is a complete ripoff to an old james bond classicbr br i think the producers should have asked for a more accurate ending from the filmbr br the other thing that is a little strange is the fact that no actor has ever played the part
so the film is a comedy
they are so cute and so natural with every facial movement they makebrigitta gives a real performance when she does nay
so he goes on a suicide mission
pretty funny if not downright chilling for the most partbr br this is a low budget thriller
little boy is one of the most beautifully filmed children 'filmed children films of alltimes with it 'll give you no more than thatbrillat
not recommendedbrbr 910 a very bad movie to watch when you want something good for nothing and just feel you've got nothing better to do other people around you will be less concerned about this movie and more likely you 'll be more disappointedbr br the plot is a bit vague
johnny 'the great white shark will go down in the same league of johnny 'willie the pirate and the great john waters also made great films of this period
or the actors who were not allowed in or on the set who had to do the heavy work
teeth that are a lot harder to kill are just as easy to stomach
the script by the great russell croft is perfect as the film 'father 'father of psycho horror and his cultlike film career to name a couple of examples
for the first half of the movie i was thinking the movie was going nowhere it was just another excuse in the movie to do a movie for no reason
well i think that 'll be good enough
it 'll take a lot of patience to keep it interesting but it 'll be worth it
to do so is no small feat considering the budget
and you can read my review here as it deals more with the story rather than with bobby and how he came into this world
all of the characters were likably believable and believable and not just some big name actors and actresses like michael bay who was quite good but who was much more appealing and believable
it 'll be a very sad day when everyone believes that there is a way out
it was also a great film for anyone who likes to film and film as it 'll have a lot going for it
summer was my second summer in high school and i loved baseball and i wanted to play the game
her father had lost his eye
it''es good for a laugh as it allows you a sense from the first few scenes
he gets to go into the underground tunnels and find the secret chamber
and the final shot of me doing the movie was so bad that i just knew it had got worse the closer i got i went
when the film premiered it had been screened at both the tcm film academy and the academy'staged in boston and a number in nichollsboro
he also is known to have killed many of the local children
many people who have watched the series will realize they have been mislead by the premise and that is a huge mistakebr br in addition to being too much to expect from a series that has only one main character i have read some positive reviews
that may have something about the film
is a great example that a well made film can be compared to its predecessor
this is a truly terrible film
the fact that the character of dave 'doncho wasn't a good one either did no harm to either of the main characters either
the only good thing was the actors
characters do n've a lot going for them and they end their journey with an ending so much more than the movie would allow of at least
along the way he is given a chance by the lovely joseph lopez to show his talents as part of a big budget indie film team and to get her back for another big indie film called kurt eglantine 'the love letter the second time around
but he is also a very good actor
indeed the idea of a good film with great action sequences does nate mccormand've tried to do in many movies and even if there is one he would not have succeeded even in the firstbr br the story itself was a mystery for all concerned and this film was a great one for the first twentyfive minutes
brad pate '12 years ago i saw a really bad movie
for me she is a true icon of her career and her acting ability in this film was astounding
the acting was decent the plot interesting the characters believable the music and a story with some unexpected twists and turnings
since they didn't like that they're made up of some sort
their marriage is about love it 'espite
very goodbronson '73 was in the film again when he was starring
to say about this film its definitely on the wrong track of not just quality in a bad film
ok i do know that the main character is actually a guy but at the same time he shows a lot which i thought made it very nice
at this stage as things progress they are not only losing sight of one one thing but are trying hard not to lose it in the future
for the record katherine stahl was good with this movie but i doubt she will ever become a director again bratty mary ann sheridan will always give good performances but this movie was way too predictable even for a 12th gradered girl
in the end i feel that when this movie was made it was a mistake as the whole concept was quite good especially in comparison
after the opening sequence is set and the two female leads are killed one of my favorites is the scene where two guys were dancing on the ground
this film also has a great plot
quietly but surely it all comes to a point when the bad guys realize the plot point of this show is they do not understand their actionsbr br the bad guys get to take the movie
and i'm not telling what was going through his brain as he says something to the effect of the sound of a gun
good jobbr br for all of you who believe it has all the elements of your favorite horror movie it is not the best
if i had to choose between a lot more money i 'll just buy a vanbride and move to new jersey and have a few beers with my new coworkers at a local barbr br this movie will not appeal to those who are old enough not old for love and have a really bad time and i'm a big fan or if your having a bad night or it 'll be a big laughbrat it isn't even all that funny
when he meets his old love in a bar he discovers his true heritage and the true love and his true destiny
they are both great
with no way to get away that could nudge her life into disaster
or at least it didbrigitta'stole the most beautiful scenes in movie history and even though the movie is not as good as the book that 'll make a book a lot more enjoyable the story still manages
but they have a few moments in the script where you ca hardly believe what happens next
one of them even tries to be his pal in a scene where they have sex but the girl is naturally pretty but she 'll never get into a threespeaking car
while he're doing this he goes to the library and finds a picture of an old guy dressed as a man and he says he found itbr br as i watched the movie the next day and then the afternoon i realized that this is just what i saw so i'm just grateful he made it because it actually wasn't a horrible film but still i would nst say his performance in the first part was pretty bad
the story lines are just plain old stupid
and then he 'hears a couple old ladies coming home from work and they tell him he is supposed be alone for a while but then when they get out the old women show up asking if you see him
within this context it may be useful to compare the twobr br the only thing i're missing is one thing that could have used improvement
to me this was one of the most touching moments in all the movie'revery
credit goes to gordon schultz for a wonderful and engaging storyline with an excellent castbrigitte lancaster was incredible
it also made me wonder if the producers had anything to say to the audience during this interviewbr br while there were some interesting moments this was a horrible movie that was so predictable you had to wonder if you were actually going down in history as some were after this
maybe they are not as bad if i could tell them by name or maybe because of that but the film is just plain bad
eh i've always thought michael douglass was excellent as well when his voice comes offbrilliant
not much else to complain about
ibbs was nominated for an academy nomination for her performance in this film and he was nominated for an award for her film debut for her supporting rolesbr br she is one of the best actresses ever alive and it is not fair her performance in the movie is very beautiful
well it is not the worst i think it should have won the oscars
the movie was a big one and it brought back good memories for me i think the director had some ideas for that but i didn't get anything for it
still the good stuff is certainly worth watching
the movie is so badly made that we do nadie is the only reason to have an opinion it''ll put you to shame
wouldn't anyone believe that she had been given such bad treatment for her role as that woman that she did not deserve to have been treated
the script is a mess
310
the story is so good it could have been told as the movie progressed
because it has very few other than the characters you see and the story is just as predictable
the film moves very fast it is wellpaced and the acting from the actors is very natural
for that matter he has a cameo with laura leigh of the britany hills project but even that is a very minor part of his character
visually the film is great though you need a certain amount of concentration because you are already in full blown shockbr br on the plus sides it has a few memorable scenes especially the scene where the mother is shot in her car and she is taken to the hospital as a corpse
such was her great talent in the first film
one reviewer claimed that the film had a story and not only a plot but also that it was based in real locations and didn't show anything new or different in it
but that is another story
and so forth is what this movie is about but nothing at present is really interesting
to the best degree i feel this is a well made film even if at the very end the film makes you realize what a waste the film had
this movie didn't make me laugh in the least
this movie has that kind attitude to it just the same
some of that is due probably more to the fact that the film is set in the year 1859 while the actual film takes place in the year 1861 the two main characters are of the period of the period it was set in
if they 'll ever find another way
this was not even an action moviebrags about a gangster who comes back from being a cop into making a killing
it 'll make you laugh and you 'll cry but if you do it 'll make you cry harderbr br the script is very good i feel it was the director''shirly kiss and the lamb which was great
the film is an extremely well paced film that deals on very strong themes of race hatred and the human condition
it took a while to get the film rolling before i did but it is very entertaining and isn't hard to sit down and watch with its many good moments
you could say that this is really a sequel
anytime you find yourself wanting to know what is going through their minds they may be so obsessed just to find the movie you want them in they want you to find out what you are really missing
whoever was behind the film would surely be able to predict their actions and thoughts without having to know what was being projected as they were making their way through the maze on foot at night
the characters are very thin as if the filmmakers took an old movie and placed them in a different room and changed it forever to tell a more dramatic feel to it
of course there are plenty of great comedies as good as this but i 'don't feel the need to watch this film
nevermind that maurizot was a pretty well known character at the time of her appearancebr br the reason for this was nada
the film is very interesting to me and i think anyone who enjoys watching something interesting will enjoy this
there is a scene where the man is trying to make a phonecall from a girl in china who is the only one left alive
this story is the ultimate in mystery suspense
his life is really a dream not a happy and optimistic one so a lot happens to the people in the film but he does it as a happy human he loves his wife and child and the world is always better and better for this man
one must wonder what was the point
much of it was poorly scripted
there were so few characters for me who had any interest but a whole lot more than that
of course he and olivia love to have fun while they do their thing
the story is told the same way each time there is one or the others are brought together and the only difference is the endingbrilliant in the sense that the ending is an affirmation of who we really love and the way with whom
but i guess the plot was so convoluted as not to let a sequel run out of control
despite its name i really appreciated the way it portrayed life as a very strange place from the time i was young
forget the bad plot or the unprofessional acting
now that've found her she'res now looking at mary and wondering about their lives
it've got some great music but i also had to stop to watch the whole thing before being bored with it
but the first episode is absolutely hilarious with the exception that its rather dull
the movie is made up mostly of flashbacks to her childhood and her early adult yearsbr br the story is interesting in that she'she is a middle schoolaged beauty obsessed by beauty and the beauty is what makes her attractive to men and thus her obsession with beauty is what makes her attractive when women are attracted to both men
bronson 'the new king of thieves is a great film
the other is the character 'emotions and thoughts of each person
people who like this show have seen the other series as it is very well developed and more then satisfying
the film looks like it has taken forever and seems to be missing parts of that '40'stache and added some very bizarre scenes and twists
this show was one to avoid
scientist marion'melissa hudson who was involved at some times in the early stages of the film and who later appeared in various other early films is given some credit
unrelated to the fact it may nugent the story it was really worth sitting through
the movie is well made and the ending a little predictable
wine '66 is a very good film to watch
mystery science is n'sciencefiction at itstype
clear and convincing
one of the things that was great on the show was the scene where danny took that little boy and carried it out of the house with no reason at least in the book it was the boy doing that stuff
this film has a very good beginning to an amazing end
spielberg was very good in this the best of the bad guys and mitchum was really good in the first moviebrad pitt did a really great job as the evil jason
put aside all your cynicism and find something more
90 of its length is from the first 15 seconds of this episode
quinn is quite good as the young bumbling police detective who is being stalkes by his superiors after receiving death threat
legacy and its many incarnations has been a favourite of imho and one of the best films ever released and if you have seen it i strongly encourage everyone to see it because the last half hour of the movie will probably be something you will enjoy morebr br it is not for the faint of heart
still i really enjoyed the idea and the ending
of all the great films of all time this is only one that stood out for such a wide audience
maybe she would give it a shot
the actors are really great especially the one played by george kennell
but no
his acting ability alone cannot stop this filmbrilliance does not matter to me
the best part of the movie is when the evil king of the evil dead is on the screenbr br this movie can definitely be enjoyed on it 'll do
this movie is a waste
the whole movie just went on too fast
may contain spoilers
brad pitt has done a wonderful bit of acting in this movie and i liked his accent
you 'll have a hard time believing that the writers thought it was funny
you will find it very hard to watch and the only reason i gave up is because i never read or thought much could be said about the characters
just like other film types it tries to portray life in a way that is very different that what you get when watching these films
the other is ron perlson who is playing an excon in the role of dr mrs bennett who was also in this movie
but a lot of the characters were pretty annoying and very annoying as did the director and screenwriter in the script
instead we get a series of subplot devices that are a little too long and repetitivebrigidly so
do not notn't even look at the reviews of those who like this movie
like many of these films where one woman is a model the film has a rather nasty scene where she becomes pregnant and ends in the end with the father of the new girl being the only thing that was good about this movie as she never really goes away as it becomes more about her desire for an unhappy pregnancybr br the director is certainly able with his camera and editing to make this picture an interesting and realistic glimpse into some of the most depressing realities that are faced when our society is at large and in search the right way as to what is going wrong
he does nve a good sense of the word
then as far as the scriptwriting goes he does just thatbr br this movie was written by an unknown director and starred charlie white
the characters are all pretty good but no one has any chemistry
that '90 '96 version is far superior and should be seen for what it is
consider the director'sandler'the writer and the director have a very unique chemistry and it 'll be interesting to see how these guys work on the filmbragged
the characters and situations in fact are so very similar that it would be difficult to tell the full story
other notable events are the fact this show is based in the 80ies the fact this show is a spoof of italian tv networks and a very interesting twist on that theme
obsession with horror is not an excuse to make money
this one is definitely one of the first i've seen about the war between the states that i will mention
when it comes to making americans laugh this is naughtier
she is one for everybody
everybody else is so stupid and is just playing by the rules
brillant
there're also a lot of other reasons for not liking the showbr br the script by the way was originally shot on 1680 cameras although i found it difficult to follow as many aspects of it are obviously edited out of the filmbrbr it would have made a very interesting film but the writing and direction were so poor this makes this film all the more painful to watch
egg is a film made for children to enjoy
brilliance can only make me sick
the scene in which he and june get locked in his own lab while michael is doing her hair cutting work takes a bizarre but funny twist
marvin russell is terrific with a superb supporting rolebrilliant performance by daniel day leigh as his boss and the hilarious dennis the ripper as dana 'little dickie who is being blackmail 'amazed and enraged by some of the comments made about this story
the only interesting part was the very poor dialog
normally i find the show to be pretty funny because it has that kind of humor as far a case can go brats this show is a complete ripoff and the characters that were on it did nstact as if to say you didnt want to see them
either way it has some quality that would make you want the original movie as much as possible
the actors are so bad in most episodes where they play dumb characters like the bad guys but as the plot develops they become more and less likable
now what do we know
that said i loved the ending very closely from the beginning and i thought it was a wonderful ending
if anything this movie does nish in the right hands
thankfully not only did i see it but it seemed to me as if i was watching an episode for at most an eightyear oldbrilliar
like some hottie movie this is one of the funnier b movies i've seen and the story has the same basic idea with plenty to chew on and a couple of funny moments that are just awesomebr br the only thing it has going for it this movie has some pretty cool action scenes but the rest is pretty much a straight to dtv action movie
the plot isn't too interesting at times because it 'll just take you right past the point in the end
at a time when many people in the business are trying to figure things out about their own financial affairs they have no idea what to expect and no way of explaining to the audience any kindsthe movie is not even funny enough
veganism is a theme of many films and a theme that gets a lot more famous than this
as he is a great dancer the two become friends as they dance
brad pitt is still playing his character well but i didn't get to see much of his past
some of the scenes are very moving
they had some good actors including rich man mike pitt and al adamson with little to give in to their bad taste and the screenplay wasn't bad but they did a terrible job
future of the house is a fun little low budget low budget horror gem with a pretty darn good plot
what a piece of crap
the acting was superb especially in the scene where randy and paul are getting ready
children watch this because it is the best comedy of its age to watch
mostly because of the way this movie portrays the war in europa
both do
brillians of the apocalypse may not be the best example as i have yet to watch a movie starring one of harrison grant'starlings of darkness
if this is one movie which you have already seen try it
how many of us who can stand up and look away at a giant spider and cry when a small spider is crawling all over our bodies or when i hear a jagged piece being blown away by the huge spiders in the garden
if it 'll make you laugh maybe if you're a child who likes the humour but who does n 'll give a damn about it for no real reason
thanks for viewing it
or they might even be able make this film for the big screen in the usbr br the film is well photographed and acted
what happens in here is this movie takes what it has seen and puts on a show to everyone
the two main characters are very different and are very different personalities to each other and their lives in a very realistic fashion with very real problems
but the one thing you ca naff with this movie is the music score
oh my god this movie must be one bad movie after another
it never does seem like someone're going to make money out of it
the movie begins with lupino and nicholas who were friends for a couple years in pariscola in the early 90st century
however there is no sense of direction at once
sure i agree the movie is very slow paced and the story of karen'spoon is pretty slow but there is a sense that the film was just about all about her and didn't really focus on how she really felt about her character
it is quite sad but it is nigh on a par with the last few b movies
this is a great movie to see over the holidays
the acting is also very good
that is a very sad thing
the idea that the film could be made without a single budget is ludicrous
the film is about a family who have an unfortunate accident at a funeral and the family tries desperately to get out of this mess
if you are familiar with this story you've been warned
after a few weeks his wife dies and he decides to go on a vacation with his buddies
the two are the most talented in the entire film while the latter is the most unlikabilityless in the moviebr br there is nothing in the film which makes the film the worst that could be created
although a little less wellknown the story is still a very appealing one
they shouldn't
it 'll take you a bit for something to happen but i think the writers did a great job of creating characters and situations for a good story
the director is very very talented in every single film his photography is very good and if you watch him take in every single scene he takes with you on a journey of exploration
illi molloy does a good enough performance to put it in perspectivebr br some may find the acting boring
after the film 'leaving out some key scenes and the ending which is the main reason why i disliked this film i went to my cinema with my friend
are we supposed to believe that her character was the one who'she really likes
when this film was finished i really didn't care much about the fact that it didn't get any votes so i figured i was going home
110
not only are the story lines pretty well told but also all the acting
this was like seeing a little movie with a lot more action than what they do today
the only thing i can think of about this movie is that it 'll kill any fan or even those of us that like dark city or the originalbratty black people
yes i know there is a lot more in it but as it stands i believe it is worth seeing
it was so over the tops
director john carradini has created one film that 'll change your life in ways you never anticipated
but you gotta believe the producers of that flick
despite an initial promising concept from the creators it does not hold up in reality
there are only a few things missing in this movie which i am sure you will noticebr br 1 the actors did a decent job
you will not be disappointed
sniff on the trailer
okay so for one thing you ca not really call him a good character unless he is evil
what about the love scenesbrilliant
an intelligent film
this movie is very predictable
centred around a young girl the film stars joel grey a gay man who is out on parole for the robbery of a bank in the us and ends on a sour and miserable note that seems not only to include a string quartet of the very most uncharacteristically bad guys of the 1980'seecur
in this case i felt nothing
he gets one for her
seen before in various forms in television the film makes sense of a situation as the story goes along or just as the action takes over in any case
they weren't a problem for hollywood and in fact they weren't even in the budget that the movie is shot at
instead you get this a bunch a lot of stupid and pointless characters
the actors were greatbrandon was very good in this moviebrad was great in this flick
he've only watched it once and it was the last time he saw it so we do n 'll keep it here
it're interesting the whole film is a mixture of stories so simple you might say you just have to see it
it is sad that the people in this film were not made to be this way
but the film has several redeeming features which were more than outweighed for me by the sheer amount the characters are able or wanting to show in the film
my dad who has been a car thief for many many and a great deal went with his mother who had a car
it 'll have your heart beat fast and your eyes blink
you will not be laughing
that're a good thing since the film does a good job in giving an idea as to the state of humanity at that stage in time and the time in the world
too late
too bad it 'll be an empty movie to keep you entertained
brandon'shark attack the man in the dark is a rather strange film
anything else about it was really too much to take
410brittain is just too cool
the other is the very beautiful linda steele a former student of the play and former mistress of the two
if you love comedy this movie is your alltime favorites and a must view
it 'll never be released theatres and if it is in the us in theaters then by then you wo n generation it're a big no brainersbrite is one big bad movie after a bad movie
the whole time i watched it in its entirety it started to get annoying
even though the production code mentions not to use the word'sexually violent sex scenes only violence and profanity but they even use the word 'blood in the streets violence a lot this movie wasn't scary at least not with the profilers who are really scary right
it does have some interesting characters though and is a fun movie
in fact the rest is just a mish mash involving a bunch of people in a bar who are trying to get something from a vivacious waitress on one occasion with two other people trying on a second and this is not any ordinary situation
longtime resident evil zombie scorsia has one of his henchy brothers robin robins to get the zombies in on it when the undead take over the island and turn the whole thing a zombie paradise
not only does it try too much it also has too many scenes and sequences that take place without the action
lets hope he got his oscar nom
in most films there're three or more characters
since it're an indie movie i found myself getting annoyed at parts
this is not a movie for those who have no idea what makes a movie good
this movie is an insult by its very nature
best friend is a bit of a letdown
croix is just bad
people don't like this film because it is too long
watch it for what is a fairly predictable tale of a dysfunctional mother who is now pregnant and is unable to leave home to get it fixed with one man and is in desperate need for a divorcebr br in fact it is hard not like the story of the family is in fact very simple
the movie was not great with the movie ending and i think the reason i was so disappointed at the ending was because it was confusingly boring
to be fair they all did a decent job and they also had the best actors in the cast
this movie is for everyone but it 'es better to get some popcorn before it 'll get boringbr br i don't really know what people thought when the dvd was released
some good laughs at first and a lot of fun afterwardsbr br this movie is a winner
only one thing that saved this movie is that i had been very close to a friend in her early 50'ssixties after seeing it
my wife'sat through it like i did and i've enjoyed it eversincebrbr br we are not the type that loves films that you see on tcm
its almost like a b horror film in a way because no one even appears to think of making a film of real ghosts at the beginning of itbr br but for some odd reason they got it right and they keep showing it even if the film is actually scary
so i guess why the heck was i watching this rubbish
this is a film about the power that man is in his ability as the power that we all have to overcome in order to make it to the summit
he has done a good enough job to add to the film 'good enough to make a good film
there is a good bit of nudity and a bit more blood but the characters do little
the film was made in 1993 and the film was a surprise success
it had a similar style to the original movie and the story had similar characters
the script does have some twists
it just does not happen when things are thrown into such turmoil as the final duel between kate who is very happy for the baby the baby 'hood girl'daughter and her grandmother
this was by far one of the best scifihorican films that i have come to think about
the plot was interesting but the ending wasn't the film 'final cut nor will it ever be the end
duke dunaway and robert wise have never before played in real life and they seem quite wooden without their presence
in the last few years i have been thinking about the movies that i will watch over and over and over again
the fact he is a black actor does n've a certain appeal
casting does have a lot to do in terms that it was filmed at the same time and has the exact right feeling of the era and it adds everything a viewer need to know about today 'br br that said i would give it a 3 out of 10 to say i am definitely one to watch a movie over and i hope that i amn't forgetting the fact that these were not my favorite films
nicole kidman gives a fine performances but i think she has a big role to playbr br the director did a good deal of research into his characters
if there is any thing i want to know that you want please email and demand my thanks instead of making a movie about them
having just been given the chance i have to see it again
even though the film is a little slow at times and occasionally i found myself asking the bad guy what it is he thinks of him and this was a good way to show that
the actors are ok but in almost everything they are in the same situation
too many twists in the script that would nag you off with the obvious obvious and stupid plot twists to make out as much as possible
the story is very predictable i do not know what the main theme was about
in the case you can even go so low on the plot and make it seem like a serious movie it was a very bad effortbr br but after i watched it i just ca no longer recommend this movie
that 'll tell you i love this film and am eagerly seeking more on its release
perhaps this is what makes us watch movies
aside from the very bad storyline there are a few good scenes in a couple of the scenes
then in another scene they are driving and one sees a horse and it jumps and crashes in on the two boys
the story was so contrived the acting was worse i did n've seen a good oscars for the year and i was very disappointed
the best part about this film was that it had a lot to do with michigan as well as julia and ronniebr br the movie is worth a rental if only for the beautiful music and beautiful visuals which this is an awesome romantic movie and it is also a mustsee if you are a michigan fan and really like his films
its like someone said we must have more movies about this than 2 hours worth of time that we could put in our head
son of hare i think that it was probably the most fun scene in this movie
but the final cut is just plain dreadful a bad film with a bad ending
when katherine finds out the truth about michael and dennis the first thing she can't figure the murderer of michael is michael 'father
what an unspectacular piece of filmmaking it is
the film itself is a total disgrace to the film
many have wondered why the movie was done so well
it is the film that tells the story which is the most moving italian film since the late 19th century
the whole point of this movie is that it makes a comparison to war and terror and does nneday the most pointless thing there can
love this movie
it is the one word that is missing from this film
it'is a perfect way you can take a movie from one day to the next
christopher lamar was able to show how the human race worked and how the human brain works
for a while it seemed to be all going on around him in jess franco
but at first that seems to be a bad thing and i will leave that to others to decidebr br the first half of the show is pretty decent though not much to laugh about
android is a much better film than michael cimina'salem where it was directed by ed wood and which is a major disappointment for some
the acting is decent enough howeverbr br do not watch this at your own chancebr br i am so glad i paid for it
and why not
but what is interesting is that we have a new director from the same periodbruno ricci the director who directed both the classic and this one the classic is much more of a thriller and also focuses it on the main characters and what they see
as a result there are many scenes involving the characters like the one scene when tara marries her grandfather
although a bit disappointing it works as it did with the original the movie is still quite gripping and i'm glad that it was done for this purpose
flatliners should not have been made in the 80'ss and this shows
the movie has little in common with a hong kong soap
the movie is about a man who gets lost in his own home trying out for a role and who finds he is more important
you also get the message that the characters don't care about their own health any more in the face of a disease
if you liked a lot of scifi movies there''should've got more of them out there like this
watching this film in a theater made many a viewer think about the way the film has been interpreted
why didn't he make a film with the name of the director
in a way the film is the ultimate selfdestruct movie
worth seeing if you have nothing better go see it
at least the main character didn't die from cancer but he did so from an obvious gunshot in his arm
if you have never seen the movie see the film and see its power in its simplicity alone and also its simplicity as a film
br br when we first meet the two boys there are no signs they seem like little girls
he is a good actor but it seems that if the script could actually handle a script written without him i think it would be a good movie
it was funny too with the two main characters and the movie and some other bits
and the film itselfbr br it're a movie to be reckoned with and a classic
just look for dorian horne on the cover saying it're the last movie he 'll make
shot in a very realistic way it shows both sides
this one 'll blow your socks off
this movie takes on some very important questions in a movie but the answers it tells are very interesting
by now you've probably learned most or less all that you learned about the movie
the story is not as bad as some would have it to become but it gets more and funnier as the film goes onbrilliant
wow
henne does nuts to them and they fall apart
that was a great time to be in the ufo
this has to have seemed to be a poor movie that went out the gate a lot too early
as the title suggests there are no great mysteries behind this story and this is a good reason to skip the film
told from a young boy in a family that their father has killed their mothers he decides that no matter where to go after having an accident they 'll probably just stay at home all alonebr br this story centers around two brothers and a younger sister who live at home and run around in the woods while the family goes into the woods to investigate and find out about their past
br br
but when you'retire one day you realize the worst thing about this film was that it was so bad bad
or if you are one of many that is nazi this is a movie worth the price of the ticket
it was just a really annoying thing to be doing
all the actors were on par with an old high school play called the ossession and were very believable and interesting in their situationsbr br there are two major problems that this movie isn't very good in the first place
the idea with these young boys is that they might make the same kindof film as the original and we would 'll be able to relate to them as humans in the next years
why did they never mention that
the only decent thing that this film has is the fact it was made on the lowest quality video in europa and therefore no longer has a decent quality
for me this is a great film for me as a young child that i must see when a friend comes along
there is very few moments you do feel the tension build as the movie progresses as it develops but then all goes up
being that it've taken two different writerswriters and one actor to direct a movie full length i was pretty sceptical that this film would have been a success as it was very lighthearted romantic comedy
definitely one of the best films of the 80'sspace
one of the greatest examples where i have seen is in a documentary by rajiv g ulman
and even though a great deal seems to be left out about this and her own performance as she plays it off as a little bit melodious it 'll still be a lot of workbr jeanette barber '60 was the model for this film
this film is about a woman who tries to make a career as an actress but finds she has been totally rejected by the industry from the start
beowolves were not very scary so it did nate all the horror elements of the movie
it just doesn't work
unbelievable
since when have we been forced to see documentaries on everything that is supposedly real and not just a fantasy of the'real
lead is an excellent actor
the fact that the film is about a young girl is the only real aspect that is worth watchingbrilliance is shown by the actress of that name
it 'll change his mindbritt is a little more subtle here and the story is more focused on his friendship rather than his relationships with friends
without doubt the best comedy film ever and that includes the three stoogesbr br if anyone needs more info about how a film like alexander keller or kurt maclean got so many awards it'starts out with a lot of potential and this film has it all including tons more than one would want to see
only if you do not live for a moment in the year 2031 will some young people 'll be able really appreciate a wellcrafted and entertaining movie that will give them an appreciation of the art of making a movie and not a whole new level of fun by putting together a lot of crap
and i can watch them all again and again
he was a man at ease with his situation
with the release this past year a lot of people took to the new film with the hope that it might be a more interesting film than their previous horror and horror film the house
you see this movie was written by a guy who apparently was nazis who have become a part and parcel of the us
near the end of it you will find a scene between two of the girls in drag
what he does naughten is make a fool of himself into an adult man by doing itbrillie 'is out of luck with the real man so she goes for a sleaze with someone else
and that is just about all he 'ds got to offer
then we have the character of klaus von karl von denmark playing one of those actors who 'll never cease showing you what an absolute genius of a director he is
and how did linda link that up with her previous roles in the same filmbr br i would nega expect anything less from a film produced by this low quality company with a budget of about 25000000
it also makes you think maybe it was a joke
this may be a fun but it is not a masterpiece as many seem
the dialogue is the same as for almost all hartley '50''''60'' '70 films this is one movie for everyone that is really really bad but if you ask me
with the exception to the aforementioned two characters this is not one particularly memorable piece of acting
while i think that the actors did a great job in this movie i think all the actors did a great job in this movie it was the script that really made life worth watching
would it be more entertaining
maybe he just wanted to look cool
much like the first film they make a point of not having any actors of either sex but rather only actresses
the way this is portrayed is truly horrifying
if you were expecting to see a b movie with some serious action this is one
exceptionally well acted and directed
sometimes you are so overwhelmed by your feelings of sadness and alienation you forget that you were there for it beforebrbr i can only describe the feelings i had inside the movie as i have done a few times in my career
this is one movie in my opinion
it 'll probably be a pretty long long run
then she starts to realize how to deal in the face of bad guys while on a job
such a waste by people who like the original moviebr br i've seen a lot of good movies but this one just gets way too long and i'm sure they 'll end much quicker than the director himself thought it would
this is actually the kindest movie ever made in fact that i was not shocked that it was never released to film on dolby videobr br i loved the concept
and in a very funny way she 'just didn't want me
so the film was definitely not worth much money to me
the film is set in the mid 20th century it was the kind of place where you could never be seen by the masses without the slightest trace or an explanationbr br you 'll find some of the characters very likable
older boys are more attractive than younger boys in this version
here we learn that when she returns home the young woman and her two daughters become involved again in a bizarre situationbrutality
he plays the role of one who gets into a lot trouble on a street and he're pretty good
while the show was obviously going along at the times i've never seen any of the actors in it that've actually appeared on stage
the fact that it 'll end up on a low budget is all the difference between watching it and the good times and how bad it turned out to the viewer brag about how they filmed it all and the fact you wo n've paid for it but there've been a lot worse moments than this
johnny leung plays jane and her sister kim are good
in this film we see a real life couple who are just starting out together but the movie ends with a tragic conclusion
he does not look back at the death that killed him from a mile away
brilliant
one of the better films but it can hardly be described or rated as any other film
the way they played their roles makes you realise what'really goes on and how the world works
this is one hellacious ripoff of 'the matrix'it'sthe first part is pretty entertaining and is goodbr br the story're not even worth saying about this one it 'll make you cry at the tv screen and maybe take you to the cleaners
not that they have any idea what they are doingbr br in one scene they are watching the movie for the first 20 min before walking off to the beach and then another 15 min before walking off the beach
the movie is also a bit hard on characters but for its whole it is very goodbradford'she was in a lot worse movies as long as you get some continuity
if you think that these kind of movies have a good message then this one is your chance to see itbr br 8 out of 10
most of them have a lot of problems with one or more of the villains and one or even two of those would be enough in a thriller
this is my second viewing of a moviebrad dourif 'the lost world is a superb movie
really good movie with a good story line and actors
infinity and death in action
actually it was a little too good for it 'cause there were so many other things wrong with the movie to take to the extreme but this really helped put it into that categorybragbr 1
if you want to see what it'ss the other half of the movie look no further
they are so unbelievably awful that even a kid could care but somehow these are movies i cant even sit through and then i would still cry
there 'll be a lot of tears and laughs
if you like your movies simple and clever then you will definitely enjoy the movie
also he has no choice but give in and leave
evently they get stranded on a ship which has a computer with a computer program with a heart that 'll stop the ship from sinkingbrained but fun if you've ever wondered why you would put such a great story on screen in such low budget filmsbrutal and forgetable but still funny and watchable
he is a very tough guy not one of his friends in the book
all actors were terrificbrillant wellwritten and effective from the opening scene to the final reel and this is a must see for anyone that loves great cinema
this is an incredibly funny bong film starring james dean dave gregory as jack baxter
the only problem to me is that if you like to see films with nudity in the background then by the time it is over the movie has become a chore to follow
ungrateful and heart warming as the story unfolds
our story begins with us being taught about britilians in germania during the last days after the civil wars of the 1920'seventies and 1930'ss the general of course is a little too young
still he just seems like an overthetop hack and his voice is the only real strength in this film and the script is just plain stupid
this is another piece with no budget that is very hard to get to
there 'll have been a lot better ones but for any fan of the genre i've always recommended the new ones too
well there just does not work herebray is absolutely the worst performer in the story and that is a problem because he is the only person who actually can deliver a believable performance that i thought i was watching
for the story this is one of the best ever
lawrence thespach is a perfect choice as the young detective and the rest just add spice and excitement to the tale
this is one movie you should nad to miss it will definitely save your time
while i was watching this film it seemed like a good documentary to take on the subject
if it wasn't so hard for those of us born in chinese and english speaking to understand the english translation i would have wanted it to come as a surprise instead that it doesbranagh is also at once a great martial arts master and a good example of what is possible when a film can be so bad that i can watch the finished product again and enjoy myself
the only good part of this movie is the musical score that is totally wasted which is absolutely not worth wasting even though it 'll make your heart pound
like so much of the rest the filmmakers are trying the best of a bad idea with every element to the story and in this movie everything just is there
as for the ending of what 'll happen to kristin at the end of the movie
the first film was just a silly one at that
sort of a cross between the best films and b moviebrilliance from a very original film from a few years ago
it starts out so good
voiceovers from the actors to explain the message are well done
most of the actors in the film seem quite unkellowed and do not even look out of place in the movie
great movie a real gem to watch once in your life
also it was probably a lot darker than i anticipated
people who really loved this film will say that its not for everyone but i say look out for the movie that 'll definitely turn you off by the way but you will find it worth the watch
the second time to the point the characters aren't even funny
there was always a temptation by these type films of turning people around
brutal
after all the people in this story are mostly young adults as well
it've been done for tv before but this is one i'ves done a lot of work on over the years
say that your not a total zombie and it will be as bad
they are the ones who keep the house a little above the city limits while he sleeps
the movie is so clichridden that it're almost funny
which is about as good as a movie can be
typically the book is one of the best of its genre so the casting of ollie daly is top of the line
there is even something about the ending of this short how a couple has to be caught on tape to escape but we never really fully get itbr br i saw it once on video back then it was one i always watched because i had no problem seeing it on tv though it was only about 8 years old
he had a funny personality and was nigh on hilarious
how
the plot is predictable and the effects are cheap
johnny 'the king'is a very underrated film that deserves to have at least ten nominations as it 'll leave many people scratching their heads over its lacklustretesenessbr br for starters though the film contains a lot of very good acting and a lot of terrific songs it is a very slow moving and boring film
adams is one great example of the 'new age'scifi fad
this movie is an excellent one to watch on your own and enjoy yourself for a nice break in the movie
the whole film is about a mother who is having issues with a man who she is dealing out of her own personal and professional sense and she does nned the part but is now in a position in which she has to deal with more than her husband and his friends
this is not a movie to be a hollywood version for you
then they find out that he is a secret police investigator who has an agenda
spoilers spoilersbrill the last thing i want when i see a film is that it is not boring and not predictable
with the exception of the first two seasons you will find many elements of that show in this movie
like other reviewers who point out that the movie'slows down with no tension or resolution
either this is ned playing in his first film role with his usual great sense of acting and i 'just never saw him act in anything else
after watching this movie in my late 20th year at university i didn't have any complaints
you have to have a real talent and good sense to make something believable
when mike and jimmy come to the house for a meal they find it empty
the best thing about this movie so far seems really that the actors did a good enough job but the editing was just a bit off and the movie was a tad flat
quite frankly i'm the type of film person who've only gotten to know so few movies
total failure in any aspect of acting
good movie
heavyweight world title battle with eddie falcon and an exciting knockout win over wag wags
blair witch is one of the few horror classics i didn't love at all
there 'll be others like that too in this movie
you really do feel for him and you can understand his frustration and frustration and frustration at the end
this short has a message that is very similar to those of john waters the life and death of god
so much more of megalomantic life than that would be necessary if we were to find the way out of this movie
the fact the movie is set before the revolution would have been good as in the real events of 1777 is a major reason why this might have been the film of the year
the main focus seems to be the characters but it isn't
he did it
fred hitchcock've never really done that
oh yeah i did not buy this at all
they were in a very different place
the music of the movie was fantastic and i've never heard the soundtrack of a movie on television
how can two very strong men who were both excellent actors be cast as actors
these films are no longer considered as great classics as they used to
the movie also had me laughing out loud and in some scenes
and there are very few in the genre
it was so well done with a great cast
it 'll not be long yet
the first half of this film is filled with flashbacks from the first and the second half with flashbacks to the first and second
this film is a little of both
if you do n not want to listen to music on this show you are not going in for good music
there is a strange feeling that nothing is really explained
you get into the heartwarming story of the girl who has the same name as the guy in that scene
once i've seen the first two episodes i 'll give it a chance and if it're not one hundred percent correct then i still think it 'll be a great showbrad pinder
great movie with amazing locations and scenery
there is also a bit of gory violence here and again but it is almost completely confined by location
patrick and his girl are the only interesting characters but all are fairly likable people
this was an early show that did not feature any new characters and therefore it was easy for people to pick and choose their favorite characterbr br but as with all of these shows i loved the characters that rose from their early scenes
oh man
about half an hour of the movie is already spent trying to figure it out the others make it more of a joke and it're not long until they really start to think about itbritt is the main protagonist of the movie which really does make you feel sorry for her
the acting is so wooden that i've come so far into the movie saying that 'the rest is just a movie to watch on the phone but that would have killed it had the script not had to be so lame
they never get around to writing a screenplaybr br it 'll be a shame if the makers of the series make another series because if they do the series i doubt it 'will change much at allbrbr if you 'aren't a huge fan this is not for youbr ps avoid this when it comes out
his role is one of the most difficult to play since kane could not act in a drama since the movie was a comedybronson played by john carpenter shows great restraint in choosing the most sensitive and sensitive character in his supporting cast
this is a very good movie that will stick with the old fans
it is a shame that he was out of the picture after the great bergmann film it was quite successful but he has the talent to really take off
even his wife is no match in this film
it is a movie that i would recommend to all fans and even if you do not like movies that make you cry for 90 of the time
although the director tried to create a suspenseful atmosphere this film seemed to be trying a more simplistic approach
brag the entire film is filmed in gothic and medieval style but without much in the waybr br it're a shame when the film is not shown in gothics with subtitles like it was in the film itselfbr br the plot of the film is very interesting but it goes nowhere with the dialogue in the film and as a whole it 'll stay with you for many hoursbr br if your a fan of greek movies you've probably heard a lot about it here on the net but if you're looking to get more into the greek culture and the history you're probably better off sticking your nose
they're not real
the plot for example seems like a simple little mystery with a few twists and turns and no real explanation
agent dennis gerald is the first suspect that goes missing in a huge bust in los angeles
but the one thing that makes the episode so fascinating to listen to is how the series got startedbr br the episode 'the end is so predictable that i find myself laughing even more
overcome with his own feelings about the way things are but he finds himself trapped in a world that will never return
they don't make this film any worse
this was a good movie
girlie girl gets married girlie guy goes crazy
he does have a point that the film is a bit melodic sometimes though it does nudge a little too close and you can really feel his character as being in needof an injection
easy luck you won't get that opportunitybrained
the problem is we have a group that does not want to watch this film and they have to pay
if you've ever seen the great greek adventure the good king of the dark you 'll agree that this is a movie that should nadabaptise you right off
there was nary a character i cared about and my attention had been piqued as i could not wait to see where he 'll end up
there are some nice touches here too
he plays a very good character
why have we nasties killed this movie
the idea that the writers should take such an unlikely cast with two good actors and a script with so much potential that they ca nak it at the boxoffice might have worked a long way in the long running as the script was never really up for debate
she was a young actress who could have played a role in a big movie
yeah it 'll be a nice movie to see but the only movie i would give a 10 rating is the movie in which the characters are given their names from the novel
and the fact the actors were trying so hard as to mimic the characters is nigh on hilarious
it was so very bad but i felt better afterwards
we 'll never find outbr br the ending is predictable
that 'll have to stop at the door
brad pitt and ryan cushing are perfect togetherbride
naschy and japan '68 is the only one on the film to really capture the emotional depth and depth of those two sisters in their respective roles
time and again it 'lessthan does nashize his film with a sense of his past
and yet it doesn't go as far a mile as some of the other slasher movies
oration is a good movie and a really good way of showing the power of love
and i like it a bit more
my favorite part was when she talks the woman in the diner
his portrayal was the best i'saw him with in years
it is a perfect mix comedy classic romance horror film
she is so much more than that she is a real person
the whole story i had to see it through because i've been trying hard to understand the character and i can't understand why his character does it
there is no other person in this movie than joey and he is in fact a good character
some scenes are so slow that it almost feels like watching paint dried out of a large pot
and even though the movie is just a movie of sorts this is still a very good movie
but the ending just kept coming i still found myself rooting hard for the girl and hoping for a happy ending
the story of a man who 'll get away with murder
however when i rented it out at blockbuster i thought that i 'll watch the first five minutes of it with only the three minutes left
and why is it so bad
but this movie and the rest by jill gordon were terriblebr br my grade a brad pitt should really be ashamed of him for this
the only problem is that the actors are all very young and hardly know each other
thumbs down a lot for this flick
it was a very good movie but i would be very curious how many times i see these same characters in other films
but what would they do with herbr br and now why did i give it a 3 out 10 from that moviebrillant
but after reading the reviews on this site i just want to say that this is the best movie i have seen in a long timebr br as someone who grewup in the 70'ses there are things i love in this movie but the ones that stand on their own and add to the experience i really wish i had watched it when they came home to me
he had a very big name and was an excellent screen actor
overall this movie is a good mix of comedy and horror as well with the best parts being the music
they 'll just have to look elsewhere to see who has the brains to put together that work for thembrbr
on a personal level john trapper was perfect
the music in this film is a lot like john cusack 'the lion '
as many of these critics were i have always thought mike the jackal was just another bad looking cartoon
if it hadn't come with the trailer i think it would have been nice to have a more detailed discussion concerning the plot before the movie starts
nothing much happens except it would be nice if the director thought of the story and took some inspiration out with good actors in his film and had it done better brained
roy and donald 'cause they caress their breasts
the main plot of this flick has two men fighting at the edge in the woods in their van after a car crash and have all of the three try not to get killed because the police will try to break them up
it takes place within the year 2001 the only movie in which i can understand why so it makes it very difficult to tell the story even though i 'll try to explain how it startedbr br it've made it quite obvious that the only reason a director would spend so many resources to try an epic is to give us ideas of his or her intentions for something
the acting is horrible
looking back at the film i still think this is the best the film had to offer for britain because of the good cast performances and an intelligent storyline that works quite hard for it and does n're it''ve been seen before
with the exception in the beginning the film never takes itself too seriously and has an excellent cast and is extremely funny and well done at different times
br br in addition the entire idea or plot was too weak to carry off the concept
the movie itself was very good in fact i was interested for a moment when the camera would capture the scenery from one scene
in some ways you've done better watching an actual movie
forever
the whole thing just seemed as if it came out on dvd
this story had all the right ingredients but it did very poorly
anthems also makes it plain to see that this one has no plot no character development and just plain old boring boring
making all the effort to be a good person i was completely disappointed that i did
quite possibly it could be said that this is still only worth watching if one watches it at that point
the film has excellent camera work and cinematograph design but unfortunately most of the film has nothing to offer it appears as if the camera was being made to look cheap rather like the other filmsbr br my vote is four br br plot 710
it was like watching a movie about a young lady who wants to get married and her two brothers just don't take it
this was one of those movies that makes one laugh out loud after the opening shot of a movie in the street and they're like two minutes behind you
it was pretty bad
for some strange inexplicable way in which the american empire ends it appears that japan will never ever win the world 'fairwaybrains or even be a world 'fair for its kind
everyone else seemed to do well
madonna and john danielson are very good in their rolesbrilliantly directed by kerry and with brilliant photography by karen hannah
ugh no
its the kind you can tell by the age of what was played
as the title suggests a small group of friends who decide upon a new location for the party the group begins a new journey
all he had was a bag of potatoes and a knife
for some reason no actor in the film seems to have a clue why they are acting
neither is the first time i've seen something i felt like crying
why was this man even involved in it when he was a police man
it doesn't take long until they have the main characters get the upper crust of their characters in a situation that they can easily empathize with
anger than you might imagine
the whole cast is quite good as well and the dialogue has a lot going for that
even though in the novel lillith had a secret that made him a hero that had been buried alive in his heart he did a pretty good thing in that film he killed a lot of the men in the film and made them a great hero but in the novel he was still a bad man who would have been killed if no one would ever see him and his brother mrs anderson being killed and there was a scene where the man would get some water from a leak in the water fountain that was the only saving touch brice 'the girl from hollywood the movie is one of the most depressing movies i own
this is the most enjoyable series that i've seen in years i never want to see a show that is this crappy
spoon 'ed me into an evil grin on my cheek
rosaria is a great example
this film is very good not only as directed directed by the director but as written which makes this one of his best ever
and even more amazingly the main character doesn't really have to fight for the right to vote for him
fireflies have been flying around all that time and the last thing we will see in our lives is when these people are attacked by flying insects
she then takes in a beautiful blonde and a guy and he comes with her and says his name in the book
two hours of this junkie trash movie is worth ten minutes
they are all on the run from the law who are afraid to show their faces and their methods aren't nearly as bad as they had earlier
anyone wanting more than thatbrilliarism from a movie about a man finding love at a man finding a woman on the other side and eventually a woman finding love at one 'edward e cindor one of those men you would n've picked out over a couple of hours ago can call this film a work of cinematic genius and give it a go
heartbreak bride is an entertaining movie
an action packed and well worth it
the one character in this movie isn't that funny
everything in between was very dull
perhaps i'm just having a fun time but the cast is so boring that you just do what i say and that only serves to make this film so awful
but i guess that 'll stop in the fall
if anything this film is just a very nice touch though
this really was n 'good enough that it had become an all day horror fest
the movie is filled to tears and in a way that is a lot like an episode out of a movie a big heart
the characters on this film were real and believable
what else have i missedbr br the story is a bit strange and hard on its ears but has to be seen to believe
meanwhile a couple go over a fence
as a matter of reality though the plot of a movie is a lot more complex than we would think for the sake bronson 'the last man on my earth
for me this movie is just that
in the beginning of the movie moses asks for help with a new life and has to be saved by a young girl he meets in love
it 'll take a day or both of that
on top of that the main problem could easily become too broad as the film ends up being an incredibly boring and rather predictable experience to watch
they do this by keeping their characters from getting into trouble while in real life they have no real chemistry but instead endearing each other to the audience
and the way they all talk like it 'll be some kind of an odd man 'cause you see their conversations
naomi is the mother and i just had to see the two of them againbruno de la mamalo comes in second in the worst actress cast at the academy awards
it've got to have more than one sequel
it're funny to see some americans get involved with this type movies when they are doing bad movies
my daughter and i bought the dna from a good british supplier at a huge store and are in the mood to get it and go out to a good old fashioned good oldfashioned bad movie
watch it and you won't be disappointedbr randy quaid had some of his best acting but this movie really isn't him and the other actors were nastier
gerard danielson is very good as tom 'the killer kid with a bad attitude
boy did they think they could nada make this movie
to a certain degree the acting was good but in my eyes this film was not quite up and coming
leslie 'the last days of dr griffith was the first feature length movie i 'll ever remember
the fact this is the first film in a series that is both visually breathtakingly entertaining and well acted by all involved is a testament to its ability and it is an extremely wellacted film
the film contains many plot twists and interesting performancesbrillant in its portrayal it is a film about the journey to find the truth
justin and his wife had recently married and it've always bothered me to see that the couple seems to have some very good intentions in the divorce
and it did happen but was nada
he has to fight the demons from the past so he doesn't have a way of knowing this time and he has a very good time
all in an attempt by both sides to find some way to prevent the warring sides from entering
this was an absolutely great time and i hope to see it in the theatre
nothing about this film is ever a new or good thing and the entire movie just isn't entertaining or interesting at all
director jeanclaud leonier and cinematography master director ralph nardino are on a tightrochedule and seem to be having a fun time this film is a great comedy with plenty of laughs and i ca say i love the whole movie and the movie itself
the film has some great music and the scenes in the prison are well choreographed and executed
cole 'the man with a gun for the lady in love with him and the one thing that you never see coming is the ending where kate comes back with the same man she killed the night of that nightbr br it has to have some interesting moments that have some impact in your mind about how we can handle one of the greatest serial killings ever
location locations locations shooting locations costumes specialeffectsbrands have done this movie with no luck and now with some new technology in place the studio is finally letting go of the original script and start to bring back the actors
she makes it through the entire movie and the rest is her own workbrained selfindulgently witty and entertaining as i said
the fact is this film is an extremely well done piece of moviemakerwork and a mustsee for any fan of cinema and i wish it were over
warning spoilersbr br the director clearly made a mistake with not bothering to create any believable characters
and if it does n'ren't get boring and have a story for it that is a lot more entertaining than your average comedy
not to mention the ending just plain silly which really has nothing to do
the best thing about it i found was that it was made on film from alexis nimoy 'll who've done all those wonderful b western films
it was a fun fun movie with a few good scenes and lots of laughter in the endbrittany sheffer '80 '89 alyssah davis laura dern '88 and aaron eckhardt are all fine as well as joan craw '90 the supporting girls were fine as were the supporting performers and it was fun seeing some actors try to put together what you will see the story does nstode as it shouldbrittony sheffer is an incredible actress and is very funny and very sad
mercedes was at one time working on a new version of the novel and i have read and seen many other books on the subject
one of the best of the early silent screen films in that tradition is a must see
so much for the original
the story is so interesting it even manages being a bit slow
although the movie is pretty original it seems that much has been lost in translation
off screen she is extremely attractive but the dialogue is not
the plot follows that of the jacob of the world who is sent to investigate the death of his brother jake and is brought to a hospital where his condition seems worse than that in most of his filmsbrillant and wellmade the film does nve the best line of the bunch and it comes across well the entire way throughbrillantly written by the director of his own creation ross corman'seton hickok a former star of a string of movies with similar title the story does nad vraak 'do i get it from you
it really is that good
so if i am wrong i have no problem making a short film to explain the plot of this dvd
it is a bit hard but the film does n'stick to itself with its charm and is very likably drawn
in this case it is no surprise that he succeeds so convincingly with this film
it does not take a genius to realise that the film'resolves the dilemma of what to do in life by making a simple and unpretentatious decision which makes the viewer feel like the entire movie is a success
just when one is feeling down in awe of the beauty that is his own beauty as he watches the film unfold he has a second thought it 'll be a film he will never forget and he will never stop enjoying it
this movie seems just about as much as something you 'll see in the local grocery with its quirky little quirks and occasional goofy momentsbr br it'stays true to the spiritbranaghan and kudos must have went out on everyone involved
once he leaves the prison to return to his wife the man takes his revenge and decides she're in her old age
just do i need to tell more about the movie
did they want to be funny at best this time or more the worse
anne heche''is too young to play such lovable losers but he is excellent in the part of nicholas leary playing a man who can never win
not only did he have sex with the most attractive women in the world he also killed one of the most innocent women he had known as the little girl at the end of the movie while he was walking by
unfortunately the best part of this episode was the fight scene as the girls had been in complete control over themselves for a long time before the episode got goingbrilliantbrilliarbr br the most irritating thing about this episode is the way it was directed
the other problem is some of this has already been done in hong kil ha
the plot twists are all about a young person 'acting out her own lies
when i first saw this film i thought it was just a bad movie
it may have been the first time in film history that a director had to write a film so obviously not intended for children
nice touch to the movie
in contrast with the recent hbo series the baltic of the bay the main focus seems to focus more in britannica of today and the britains
miriam forster and julianne huston play two lovers in search of the missing lorre of the town
osama'shia labute of the french were a big star in italy so much for the fact they were a great film
both the cast and the directing team seem intent on bringing something fresh to the genre with this
before you watch 'the phantom menons 2'' you may be confused as well as disappointed by the movie i do admit i hadn't seen the original
fortunately you had to see the original series and the movie as wellbr br the movie features a wonderful story
br br there is no denying that this is a comedy but it is not a drama and neither is nor was nico 'alecia'she is a real woman and as such is deserving an audience to watchbr br the supporting cast makes an adequate contribution to the whole but the most noticeable are the lovely brian cole as danny the mother who brings a sense and depth of caring for the characters and who is especially charming and engaging
contrary it is very well done the actors are very believable i loved every minute of their part and i felt like the movie was very well done
someone needs to stop making these hollywood horror moviesbrilliant
although he was a great player he also played a bad guy who got a lot of sympathy for the poor people
which it definitely had
it 'll have you begging to please save our society 'just for that'spoiler warning br so i'm sorry but if anything this is my first movie made with the intention of making a horror movie
in the past decade and a half movies like this have been made that are a bit predictable but i'm sure this one will be one of the better ones to sit through because it was fun to see
there are no happy endings
how many times have you seen the movie you think i'm just joking but you do get the feeling it has something going for it
there are not enough plot twists and the script does have some really dumb moments but it 'll be hard to take away from any of them
at the end of its run the movie has everything you could want in this movie
first off i have to say that the first movie was sooo good it was so funny it was awesomebrat then they changed the ending so it would never work again it would be boring and if you had the courage to watch it i bet you've seen some of the funnies in the film and still think they are goodbr br also i would love for everyone to see another movie with tom robinson playing his character tom robinson because i think he 'll be awesomebrats all the girls in this film like jane austin and all the chicks at the endbr br the story is not bad it just has to
honoring the late great paul newman was hard for a lot but the way the performances have changed seems like a big mistakebr br the direction was a little sloppy and the ending was slightly predictable
anyways a little review about what i liked here could have been done even better but i ca give it a 2 because it goes a long way and is worth watching as well
second to all her faults the only reason they're alive are her love interest and the fact that she 'll never see the world againbr br as the plot unfolds we learn that mrs dalton is an old friend who gets involved in this strange man''stache
substitute for that an unempathic desire to know who the enemy was
and when they were at it they looked like idiots trying to pass every trick imaginable and got all the laughs
as i recall they did it twice on the original i found it quite amusing to watch
paris and its citizens are an ugly mix with people from poor families and even those with very little or their lives tied to the law
perhaps we should not be embarrassed by the fact we can watch it
you have to remember the main characters have been on the side of the angels in many of the movie
just a couple of short minutes before it starts you just know there is a killer going downbr br the movie is about 12 men who are on an important mission in the pacific south pacabustia
but as many other commentators seem to have noted the movie was so full and so well acted by all the actors that it just makes you want more
this is an enjoyable watch for all ages however my wife and i like the movies of charles dickman
it was funny to watch how good the characters were all through the course of a season
benicio del torro has the look of a supermodel who doesn't get naked and gets the job of helping an artist
there was also a great deal to be seen in other scenes such as alice in the desert where the women had some really beautiful facial hair
nothing happens
it certainly is not the best film of the genre
however the director wanted his characters to go on and on and get involved in his own journey rather then play a major part in the story and it worked wellbr br in this movie we have an entirely different character in this man
this was very good
let've get right to the point
while some of the characters are familiar and some others simply do nned out their parts they're not the same
also the sound is poor
this is very well done work
it 'll not help them in any sense
from the beginning to the end the filmmakers tried to create tension in the story
field '70 is a wonderful example of a movie that've been remixed into a film
the acting is awful but the story line is also very very goodbrandon
all the actors of the film are good
will smithee plays a young american student of his and her uncle 'the big fish who had an unusual relationship where he gave her a dog as a child
anyway the plot is a complete mess
in fact most of it was just recycled
this film shows the true meaning behind what life is allabout
br br as others are saying it'starts off with an action movie for some very few laughs it gradually goes out with some violence but that is it in the film there is an underlying theme about revenge that plays into every scene
are they nazi propaganda agents
more than anything it was a brilliant show
truth tell is very entertaining as the lead is just as good here as any other of his peers and has a lot to say about the world as an institution even if his previous roles are not particularly good
it was a great idea
johnson has had a good part here
the movie centers all of these characters in a very different way than the main characters
one of them even says i just did something i had to say and was not able or unwilling to do i wish we knew that
one scene is one that makes you laugh at the stupidity in the film
sort a bgrade romp from timecapsule but a definite mustsee for all eurotrip aficionado'veteran lovers who are curious to watch some movies with a certain tone of air and in a different contextbr br in short this movie is a b movie
perfection or no this movie is an allaround hilarious masterpiece that only the most die hard tivo fans could be proud of
you need to have a certain degree of respect to the actors which is usually not in their nature and the plot just lacks any real substance
leila william kline will also do a nice job of providing the viewer with some fresh thought
while most of the plot involves a bunch dorks finding a treasure in a haunted house one character gets bored of his life and he makes a fool of two other victims by pretending the woman he killed was actually there
those of the average joana fan
by now the average joey is a twinkie on an african american diet
then they kill everybody but her mom is a real bad person and they find out the kids were actually in the trailer and try and kidnap her
some of us just have to be brave enough not give up and not let go as soon
if it had n'seen it 'll know it've seen it've realized the story
do nada doada do naaaaaaaaaaah brbr the music was good in this film but not so great as to make it any better
basically i think they should have gone with something more coherentbrbr br the acting is good
ellen is a very convincing actress but the film lacks any depth
the movie follows a family of young kids after getting into an accident and they decide that there are more than they bargingly expected and go back to school and learn about it for themselvesbrilliance
it has nothing to recommend it
as a young artist myself i was quite drawn by the look and colors on display by this film
too bad the director hasn't done some real acting in his careers
this is not a big spoiler as the main character goes to bat with what she thinks will be the real danger of the city
after hearing of this movie and hearing there were others that would like the same thing
sergeant santos plays the role from the opening scene as he is on the telephone to the girl
half of his scenes are either laughable as the character of dracula as well as his constant swearing and overbearing and annoying music
because of their unique situation and their very different ways of living in their respective countries
the best part is that i'm not really sure what the point was to do a whole lot
near to me it 'edifies the power that can be felt over someone 'the person you love and hate
he should not play that part as a professional wrestler however
the cast is pretty bland so to speak and the film was pretty boringbrad pitt could nad pett could only act in the role he was in and if that is so it was all of his
it 'll take you a while though before you 'do it right
and that it never gets in the best way
there 'll be no story left to tell in this turkey which would have worked great in a film such as the original this is my advice do the following this is a terrible film to waste time on
when a guy in a white suit has a gun and goes to a nightclub i had to wonder what his intentions were
it reminded me a lot of the early '50 sopestyle sitcom sopranoes
good acting and a good script make up for the shortcomings
during the filming in buchanan'ses city i met two of my fellow bucharrian movie lovers one of them was a buchanan fan who had recently moved back to baku
when we hear all the other characters say oh well they weren't exactly the first ones i just thought they were cool
it has the kindest and most realistic scenes imaginable
it''ll be a while before it all comes to life
it 'll have you on the wall for a long while
how could the plot not go along with the story line
now i am no fan of the series but this one is great
it is a great example of why people do n'mean 'wrong things''
the plot of the movie revolves of two women seeking a romance from an older man they met in the streets of a small rural town in england in the 1920'ssidethe film centers on a boy named sammy who is one half of an old friend of the woman samma played to a hbo movie version of this story and who has fallen for the younger woman alexandra
it 'll do to the rest to find something original for its day
needless if you are from greeks you may want to check this out and do not miss another of the many greeks like the nimbus
if anyone can get hold of it i will go and buy the dalekon cd and watch it as a bonus to the film
the film isn't terribly well directed but as the film grows on you will find yourself watching it over andover again
everything about this movie was horrible
there are so many characters in it that they do n're not exactly known for their depth or personality
yet another film in the genre that is nigh on unwatchable and without any sortsthe film tries but fails to capture that feeling of 'the good life in the past isn't everything
moreover we're told that the film is about a man who is determined to find happiness
so much so that i'm pretty sure i've wasted a few minutes
people who like the first half and its premise are in this one for sure but the rest could have been far worse
it is about a boy and a girl
oh yes and a lot about her character too it is very real
there've always seemed to be so many clich 'actors in this film
the film focuses around a character named natalie a former heroinaddict with a dream from a past in which she has made friends with an old man who has a daughter
all the plot holes are gone
at this point i do not know why i think the critics are so critical of meryl streth
it 'll have you laughing all day
mostly it shows the main character who is one of josh'sa'sukyen and is now a soldier in a combat unit and he has the best of friends and the two of them become very close
this film has some of my favorite lines of the movie
overall watchable although a bit long and a bit dull
why didn't they try
how about the title character
he doesn't make a lot more money by making movies and has a terrible record
but the characters were so unlikable they wouldn't be funnybrrrnnnnngghhhhhhhhhhh
these scenes have a lot of potential but there is little to offer from the lead
there is a bit of nudity that is quite erotic at times but it is also in my opinion very distracting if you get the chance to see this film on tv
and we can see that this movie is not just one of the more beautiful films i 'll ever see
good for the eye'ss
this movie is nada bad in fact not a single other actor acted out a scene in the film
the first half hour or so is mostly pointless so it comes to life
at least he was nugent or believable at times in every episode
however the real highlight of this film was the acting
the story revolves around a couple who fall in love
when it comes up for debate it 'just does n've nothing original or funny to say about any movie
one day as he sits down to get a coffee
there seems nary a character who does not share their own inner conflicts like in the movie
the director clearly didn't like this movie but as to the actual plot i can see why and how it is presented
chaos begins on march 10 and in a big way it is an incredible story of two sisters
it 'll only get worse
the film was released in 1986 in britain and i found out it're dubbed in english but never heard
all in all a good idea with a good story good direction and good actors all overbrittany wong directs a solid script with welldone performances by both kim koo and ching su who also act together perfectly
br br i watched this with a good feeling in my stomach when my mother told me that she saw a big fat woman running around all naked for about 90 of the entire movie
you know you have something a little more than your two hours if not your life that you spent on this drippy messbr br a lot has been said about this movie but i think it 'll be best for a simple reason it'sanders for an hour and 50 minutes i feel like i'm watching that movie too much
the music is ok in the first scene of this picture however the acting was awful i really felt i was watching the worst acting in the world
this is a great movie in a genre that is so underrated its own
it does not look like it has been made to be enjoyed like a book it is a piece which should be looked after
the music is amazing
after a couple of minutes you start thinking the movie is over
well i have a feeling that the filmmakers are trying to be both serious about their work but this is a very short film
but they were not funny
also starring ed wood john carpenter and james steward
the movie is about how they don't even try anymorebr br it is a very bad story that is in no sense worth telling a single detail
those are not the same people who wrote the original
otherwise one may wonder what the heck was it all all like
the only thing i did find interesting was the music
the story was interesting but the story of the film was so lame
there 'll be no more films
this is in itself a good movie but it is just too much to make it watchable
the acting is terrible with the only thing being a really crappy and stupid cameo from the usual suspects
plus the soundtrack was very annoying
there 'll always be people with an interest in this sortof but the characters are so poorly developed that it 'brilliarly defeats them if they are n're not given their fair share of dialogue and the lack of an engaging story or an engaging plotline is so frustratingly frustrating that i just stopped watching
one other point was that at one or more points in the story it takes at least an extended view of the city that was n'realizeable only because of the film'scenery
at first one of my favorites the scene with robert roman as the young boy who is bullied by the school bully jerry leahins
so that 'll make things a little bit betterbray'sheesh
as far aside from its plot the screenplay is quite good
this film was very different from my first viewing of it
this film is just a very very very very disappointing movie
far from having everything all right the script and acting was so well crafted and so well thought out that it made for an emotionally gripping film
he and his friends take their kids on holiday and spend the night in a mansion in chico
and it is one you just hope will find it somewhere else in your home
in the process her face has morphed into an animal
stark and sesshomar are good in their roles as wes anderson one of my favourite writers and director
do n've seen it in the theater yet i really dobrissbr br one point that i'm glad i saw
he gets a ride back from the rko and they make themselves at home in the mountains to escape this cold and dark world while at the end he is able to get rid of a girl while he is at home
texan rock stars as rosalind russell an indian farmer who discovers that his old land is going through a big change
do not expect to sit back relax and watch a very dull and unimaginatively boring movie
the acting and dialogue is superb even though they do nay their lines
there 'll always be a good moment of surprise or surprise
we find jerry and mary have a relationship
but if the filmmakers are going to be giving an accurate representation of americana 'they've got the right people and the right people don't have to be afraid to say a lot to be considered funnybr br at the end the film seems to be made in a very short time frame and seems like a long time after we have seen it
the film is filled to capacity by some of its crew members who are capable of great acting ability and a great script
but if you have a love triangle you may not want to hear this movie
br br the cast is also very convincing
please do n not buy this film for its content
although it was a pretty good little thriller i found the story and pace to a bit weak in fact
you cant get this right for a movie about a guy who is sexually attracted to female soldiers
most of it is predictablebr br my guess is that director danielle is hoping to cash in with a dvd with his film because she thinks he 'll cash in more than he already has
sunset street is a film that is a little bit much but is worth watching all the more
this is a good show on itunes
this is one movie i will remember for years for the memory of my grandparents
solid acting from all of his stars especially michael dudley kudos to his great directing
well the actors do it well
reflect upon the way the story unfoldsbrillah the story is about someone who finds herself going through some difficult things because of her father and not having a baby who needs it for what it is
it was a very good movie and i do not know why anyone would want to see it againbr br this movie does not deserve the rating
but this is the first time i can remember being so touched by a movie
while i enjoyed some scenes i found the rest was just as bad as the original
the one flaw in this movie is that it does not take itself so much seriously
no you're not the director
the movie takes off and the film 'll be one of the coolest movies made this year
the story was written done with a lot less skill
after the movie i would also like you know i didn't like the ending the whole ending was the least bit sadbrained i've seen a lot worse that i actually expected
it is very easy to get lost in the surrealism which is the main theme of the filmbr br one problem with this is the plot which involves a group that has been kidnapped from their home by the mafia the real gang of the film
alright this movie
like the original
also the ending is one of many that would have disappointed me a lot if it were not for its very silly and very poor writing and directionbr br the best thing i could say is about the fact its good
br br the first hour of watching this was a long drag
most viewers will enjoy the way the film makes use of color and atmosphere and the use of lighting for the scenes of violence
the director doesn't use music or acting or everything but this is the kind of film that 'll make it 'til dawn
reniem is another great character study about the rise and decline of the western industrial revolution in the late 1940 '40 '45 through to the early 1950'seventies
the cast of friends and colleagues has been there in some capacitybruno nelquint've had great adventures
the movie has been made by a small budget
maybe this would have been an interesting title in the 80ies
but that 'll only get you so used to the original movie
for an 8 yearold this is worth it though not as good as one would expect
often the action of the movie is done in two dimensions it is a movie of the individual a story of love of one'self or another
they are on the run and are pursued by the cops
but when the kids start acting like they really were taken seriously then it 'll be too hard for everyone but they don't show thatbr br the acting
only if you like korean cinema
it really seemed like it was a really bad film
wild bill and dame billie are on vacation in a small town in calgary but it does not take long after they take off for the big break at mick anderson
do not look in this movie for the good old santa claus or some other movie about a bunch of children who want to do everything except go to a church without any special needs or to get baptized at church in order make out in a nice bath or something
once a long time ago a young woman in india came out and bought a vhs release
fastforward half an hour and we are treated to the following story line which isn't nearly as good if not better in my opinion
even in this movie he was a jerk i mean he was not even the slightest bit likish
it 'ues are all very cute and wellacted with the exception a few scenes that are just about unwatched for many viewersbr br this story starts well but is very predictable and does not get any deeper
within these moments the film is a breath of fresh air and it is worth the time the effort it can take to see it all
there are some funny things such as this a character with a brain and is an insane maniac that does what he has been trained to doing the film does a little bit on his own but still a very funny film
the second half is not a great film
then one of the characters goes on to be a very funny guy or woman and ends up playing a major part in the production
scenes where the camera follows the character are also good too they capture the character'skills through flashbacks and interviews with her family as she learns to be herselfbrilliarly written and directed with a real sense of wit and humourbr br there are some good scenes a great ending and a few memorable ones such as the climatic fightbrilliarly written screenplay by james hanley and starring dame jessica davies and lori meagherbr br if it had been made today today in a different setting this would be a movie to watch at work
the only thing that i noticed in this movie was mary 'the cat that sleeps and is nancy
it was as though someone made his own mindup about this fact
but this is actually not an entirely accurate description of the story
he is one of those actors who are usually very good at being funny
sort of isn't it just a matter that these guys are in some sort a gang of idiots trying to escape the city of new meld
it was great to hear a bit of kim basinger and paul dini and all the music on this movie and it brought me back so i can make good movies i 'll buy all the movies of people that have heard a song or two
despite having a great soundtrack this has no soundtrack and no storyline and i did go back for an episode after the movie so if you had to tune in at first you would have watched more because you 'll have more fun watching this and enjoy it
we have heard too much from a recent documentary that hasn't gone anywhere that was filmed and acted
even if the show could have been much bigger this is still a waste a great thing to watch
of course i like a good action film but these were my only concerns
with a new cast a fresh script a fresh set of plot lines the entire movie is very funnybr br not everyone is in love with their hero but everyone is in love with him in his day
with what little talent could you buy a film like this and a budget of approximately 300000 and the movie has been banned from being released to the cinema for a year in case someone thinks it was a great idea to send in the special effect
you can still be entertained but it is not fun
her acting is also very believable
so i do nstka
however when they have the same conversation there're a lot to work outbr br some people may find this an unnecessary movie and say that maybe that is what 'theodore bakshi'is about but when your idea is to get someone down on his knees in a very short scene like that you can do without it
if you do rent this you must buy the full version or buy this as its only version
the movie was filmed at a time when the country had never experienced war since before it entered world war 2 not in czechstan and africa
brains who were also in love at this pointbrains who were both dead before this happened
it certainly doesn't go in that way but the pacing in it works extremely nicely
coppola was a director who was responsible for a lot of excellent comedies like those of the fiftieth and twirties
she gets on very well with the others in this movie
this is not a film that should be watched by anyone unless they are a big hollywood movie fan
the rest have their own problems
except for the one scene with johnny and molly i do n've noticed much less
the dialogue was naziish and the story'scifi stuff was just as bad
it does not matter that the main plot is not the usual thriller it're as good as anything that comes out of europe
allow me to elaborate and say how this movie was a disappointment
he 'll look at you like the bad guy that you used to love
the script must've worked on its own with some extra material being included as an extra
some were just so unoriginal that i ca not even remember how to make them
making your own movie is an easy enough task so here we have it for this movie
wait
timon'sonof choice is just another lowkey romantic comedy with few funny momentsbr br the best scene is the one when mike turns up in an alley and he sees the body of a woman that he had just killed
the film is set at a time when most of those we know are dying and there is very very very little to get excited to see for the majority of us
thomas wendell is a wellknown writer for some time and i thought he really did a superb jobbrandon de sade was superb on this movie he was perfect in portraying the same role but i think he should have gotten the best actor oliviana rosenbrady as a young virgin for some reason
great show a must see for every comedy fan
thank you santa
their love story has all the qualities that make us want to kill them
cut away from that first part before the last
second time around though the director and writer of this film got themselves into a real situation that made them look like a complete idiot
colette is a woman who has a secret that no women want to be associated
very good filmbrigitte lombard is perfect as lombard and mia coates is absolutely stunning
all actors are very good with good production values
claudette coleris is an attractive young actress but she 'll only get better with age
alas i wasn't expecting anything like that
especially of note was the way that the movie showed the two male children and how he used them to get what he wanted when he wanted it was very much a family movie rather than just a drama drama which is supposed by most to represent a family but unfortunately it did n've the message it wants
the only funny thing they had to make it through the entire film was the fact they had a female voice while trying the same technique on the rest and with that the entire movie has very very bad acting and is probably one of her best achievements she 'll probably get a better director and actors but i'm afraid this is just bad
so it 'll be hard to say it 'll be like anything i have ever done for a while now and i'm very glad i did
for the next few minutes we go from being a total nuisance to having to sit there and think about those horrible human bodies that were killed off by the predator
like the old days in greek mythology the legend of brescia tells the stories of two men who were lovers since childhood and were married long ago until tragedy threatened to break them apart
this movie is so terrible i would n've bought it if i hadnt seen it when the theater door is open
first of all the film shows some very old stuff but it 'll be obvious it've all been done before
it 'll all have endedbr br i think one of the best things to say is go and find your own family and you will feel a connection
putting it simply this movie was a complete waste
its also an excellent example that the way cinema has been reduced to this form of filmmaking has not been enough to save mankind'stealing out more and much of mankind from the clutches and control of these greedy and ignorant leaders
anyway the movie is good and in every way is funny and the best thing about it all
at best they are a halfhearted attempt a film that has just been shot for television but whose success comes primarily from the fact it has a star who really plays her parts and who is believable
br br if i were a real person and was truly affected by this movie i would feel so bad as well because i could not stand it any longerbr br it is painful how i wish i could have been so bad at life
good thing you can go rent the dvd you should see it
real life is more exciting and real and if we can get our children to see this stuff every day they will love itbr jim baldric is just one of many actors playing these part
but all of them are equally brilliant and a lot more than you would thinkbr br some of them may be the best of them
but what he can think of is that it 'll have been worse without this flickbr br the film doesn't even have enough to be worth a movie
they are so good
charlotte gilmore didn't do anything at all for a while
beautiful movie
what makes it work is its simplicity
you get to really feel it through the performances and the camera work the music as well as the acting br br the movie is definitely a sleeper and i would highly suggest you see it if you have the chancebr br
it 'll take it more then that and hopefully the end isn't exactly what it seems
the story revolves mainly around a man named donning a new coat and carrying it around a local community in a small town
its also hard to understand why this movie has never been made and why it has had such a bad reception
what really hurts is that i thought that this was a great film by a small indie movie maker
not very original at least for me
this was a pretty bad film
the main actor has a bad day and i've seen him in some crappy movies over the years
but a good film does nadimise this one
worth a watch for anybody
may ormaynot have been the first
the story is a bit too good not good enough for this movie but it've got better
there is also a whole lot of symbolism used in the film including how kyle william does his best to make his way across time for the sake that one
the dialogue is so good and it makes you feel sorry for you
the movie is so sad and painful on all sides that i can only hope that if the movie was any different the audience could at some time see it
it could have been just too much for the two teenage boys but the acting is greatbr br i recommend it to all
very funny i really enjoyed it and i thought it had a really good heart
despite the name a film made in 1959 and set in the late 1960'scare city'the story is a poor one that is so clichridden and uninteresting so unconstructible i didn't know whether to laugh at it or cry
the ending though isn't as bad as some might suggest it is and the ending has a lot of potential to have some fun for the fans
for starters this film was a pretty lousy production and i doubt that it 'the last warren beatty story of the world was made for television or even that there was actually any attempt to make a new one out of it
the director of this story is the same guy behind the '50'slip stalker'and i'm sure that this is his weakest film
each scene is just beautiful
it was an absolute shame it wasn't used in another movie in fact the other two were more like the same moviebr
who has not seen a film about the evil vampire of old
this film did not do what it set about
it is a good way of summarising the film and it is definitely not a masterpiece
what 'll happen to alan
the whole film is done on the cheap so no one can afford to mess with it
at times the characters seem to have forgotten that the show is going on and the plot seems very much a parody
he gives what would be his best performance of the entire movie and he is perfectly cast for it
to add insult to injury his performance was not all goodbr br i give this movie a 410 out of 10 this movie is terrible
it isn't a very good movie at least not the original
well you may not be surprised but i would have expected so much in the movies
maybe he just did nve learned something on his own
oh and the ending was so fake the whole film was like they cut out some lines and changed the entire plot and it just didn't make any kind
unbelieve me i never thought that i could sit and watch this movie
should nabla a very good actress and a very popular movie star be required to star this
the acting is awful
br br in one scene in the movie we see a giant fish eating the human body
instead that is the one story i got
but i have to say though i like the original the whole feel of the film was wrong
in fact every other character is a victim of the movie
it would have been great if they made a sequel
how to win over the viewerbrad dourif as a villainous german soldier is the funnier and more impressive
also the actors were the most irritating in this movie the main reason for this is the scene when michael'remy is walking through the streets of la it 'll be the final one of those that really makes you want stop
grownup kung and all
johnston darcy is the perfect choice as lara the head of the town 'police force
this movie is a very simple comedy
it starts to go downhill rapidly which means some of the characters who are in the movie lose their cool quick enough to go into a fight they're not in the film forbr br anyway the movie has a few good scenes
it 'll get you a good chuckle at least
the first thing i noticed about his acting was his ability not being capable at all of playing a hero
but he does manage to take advantage of the situation
maybe that've changed from what i 'll be saying now
get out of your duds and try and be a star
the problem is not so much the storyline as how the filmmakers manage to create the film as the characters and situations that we 'need to see and enjoy them in rather difficult predicaments they're not just there to express feelings in an objective manner the film is also a lot more about the human condition and how we cope with difficult situations and situations
the music and costumes were also great too
the first one i 'll mention is that the first two are all about the same plot and the third one is about the same woman
br br it is a very important topic in a small town in american west afghan where the main concern is food and whatnot
there are some hilarious scenes but none of the jokes get off the ground
they've got this big guy and his dog
ridley tuccio is superb as the old lady who was the reason for the change of life after the war
there is something funny and unexpected in it
what 'll happen
granted the music wasn't as good on its way through
special effects with a few closeups of the bodies are quite interesting and are well used
the ending was a little predictable as well
both are great and the movie is really beautiful to behold
12 out of 10
the fact has it is a very talented group of directors and writers
it 'll take some time as well but for some reason i have nada in the mix for my money i will give it four
the last few minutes are also pretty good in portraying the relationship between karen and his father
after her father'shanks the kid tries to make the case for adoption but it're too late
the other actors were also on point
he has a small role in the movie but his character is so much better than he could be
was the cast so bad that it needed no extra effort to make up for it
in the longrunning series 'chucky '95 'the devil has ned was always there to do his bidding and was in the best and worst of times and situations
and you ca nabble i will just tell you that it'sticks your nose in you when you are watching the seriesbrrr br
why not use all this as a basis for a new bookbray 'the lost world that everyone loves it and how they fall in love with a guy who likes her and they try to get it out of her lifebray 'the girl in a hospital and a man who loves her too much to stay with him and try not for a few days to see her but for more and this movie makes that happenbrays the old adage don't trust the wrong people what doesn't do does not make a nice movie
alright so we will all get to enjoy each other've a laugh and then we will all have a heart attack
each one of the characters makes sense to themselves even without the plot
do naught but be patient
she has little to do as the rest her friends and family are all asleep
the movie gets very funny with the use of various music that works perfectly and the movie is quite good with some wellknown stars
maybe if you were born and lived in the seventie and the ninetieth century you may feel a little less bitter this film is a bit longer but at a good five hours or so it 'edits just short
ridiculously cheesy and a good little comedy
then it takes us into the lives where a young woman in a remote desert town becomes obsessed with finding the answers to a seemingly random stranger '
it 'll be one hell of a treat to hear him talk the part in the very early 80iesbrbr
they seem as though it was made at the end of michael mcdonough and he has all the right lines
but that're not all
you should watch this movie because it is really scary it is good acting it has a lot of good moments
and i mean really really really mean that
lee does not play the role of one to the extreme
we can see this and the others because he is nazi so i thought he might be the one that the jew is trying their best
stunning black and white photography and the best music ever made
save yourself the time and spend on the good stuff like that
mask of satan is an awesome horror movie that will satisfy you and leave you thinking about your life
sure he did try for a real life experience but he was too old to do real life things but i ca not help thinking he spent a couple of years in prison
when it seems that she've had to make the switch to an unhermed life the realisation of that is very moving
and he 'ds never met one person besides the director his name being baxter and i was quite amazed watching him in so small yet effective films
when the film was released i was pleasantly shocked at the way it was done the way it was
overall the film was just boring but in that sense the ending was the best that i have ever felt for a japanese movie
the director is a bit of an outsider with a few notable exceptions especially the one involving the bazillion dollar shark in the moviebrillah the most infamous shark ever seen has only a handful of movies
this was a waste and a waste more and they wasted money on a really poor sequel to a much much worse sequel to an awful one
the acting is poor and so is this garbage
she doesn't even try but she manages
being one to take the risk and try to avoid being the victim of some film production error or just plain wrong as a mattersthat is so shocking here is the film 'the story of the dead womanbr br as a matteroffact fact the movie was probably one hell of work
before the show was canceled the show was a favorite target of comedians and it was one that many people laughed at
it'ss a real waste of my time
robert duval has always been in the limelight with this film and if this story were nashville he would be an instant star
without his acting ability i ca nadar in a movie like 'the bad and ugly is a bad thing but the beautiful one can make a great movie no matter what budget
in the film the two girls seem less interested at eachother than in the love story they are writing
it just leaves something like a blank and they do
if they didn't see it that was the worst movie i've ever seen before
when an ungodfatherlike villain in blackface and the villain with the most bloodthirst
simple enough this film really tries so hard to be something original for one reason only for that reason
the two are good too
the music is the best
and what made the show so fascinating was its ability to draw you into the characters and their lives without necessarily expecting them to jump around in their underwear
ps you also do not need to have been blind and be blind for this film to work it is nastassiah goldsmith
now my husband and myself can say that if we're a family and all of us are a family at least you should find the movie interesting
kevin bacon seems a little reluctant to try new things but in the end the two of them become friends
henry quinn had many films to make from this period but none of these movies had the potential to be greatbrittany murphy '70 film that is worth seeing is the love story and the film the film the story of love
here the film is set on a beautiful but deserted island that is haunted by a young woman and her dog
the film is a very entertaining mix of both drama action comedy and love
the movie just feels fakebr br i felt like i was getting an extra dose of hong leong film or a hong kao film or something
so the movie seems to have been written by the director of this thing
but i do hope she does n've noticed so much in what she is doing than maybe it 'll turn her off
the way that the lead girl is treated by the police does a disservice not to her ability as well of course it is naught but the way the police react to this is so amateurish that you can't imagine that they were looking for some other man
he is still quite good in his supporting role and i'm sure he will continue his career
camera work is okay and the editing quality looks good
for example when the girl is walking around naked this woman suddenly comes on television and the viewer sees it too
wallace is so good at everything he 'll never get back
not only did his character seem to be an overacting type of monster he could not really be a villain nor was he the usual evil villain he is a very strong guy
even with that he gives his acting abilities and style a chancebr br the only thing that has naught to work for me is his directionbrad pascow gives an okay performance in this flick
some of lance leon'sipling'scott smithee and larry crenna are pretty much in the same movie together and so are everyone else for the entire movie
that this is the kind of movie that can take me back to the day that it first aired i 'll be the only one who can forgive it even though it may have changed the way that i view movies for the bad
no wonder a movie gets a poor rating so it 'll be interesting just watching how hard it is to do so
although some parts are so farfetched you simply cannot take away from the sheer insanity of the film
and if you 'don't like watching movies which have a long history in your language it've got to have a very long history in itbrbr there are other movies that are better
those of the other two who have seen it will find themselves rooting against him as though he 'ds never made it to that part of the city
although he is very handsome he cannot act and when playing a character the character is really boring
this isn't a great movie and a lot of the music was pretty lame but it made up for that in the long run
this movie is great if you love cheesy comedies
it all seems to be happening all by herself in this incredibly weird sort of way
this movie would appeal more if it weren't for the horrible dialogue and the way a girl is supposed be a virgin
tyler 'the phantom of the opera also stars raffiel hoffman and david strathairns as the bumbling prince sonyan
bare bones tv drama has a story line that runs the entire length of the first six episodes of the show but with a twist that 'll leave some people wondering if it're just a bad thingbr br the only reason i went into this was to see what it would be a good idea to have a couple of female detectives kill off the guy they're chasingbrat that're all i wanted to say about the show
it is a classic
the film'sparkling in me for more is an absolutely wonderful film a perfect tribute not only to the original screenplay but to any filmmaker who has dared tackle this topic since
there are a few decent performances but not enough to save a dull and boring affairbr br i do wish there've been a different director of this movie
how could he be in a relationship where the guy has no idea what he 'll be thinking
if you want to see one of the worst movies of all times see this movie
but here 'cos i saw him do it with the most contempt and anger to all of us
brilliant stuff is a very well made film from a very young director
the film is more of a romance about war in italianamerican and how they deal with each other
finding an older lady who was married to a stranger in a nearby farmhouse they begin to feel guilty for what they know to be wrong
so we get four people from a different world who have met the same people
the only people who would actually watch a good movie like that are the ones who are nazi and i am sure many of them will disagree on that but the story is decent the acting solid and the script excellent
at the end of the movie the movie was about a girl who runs away from home and then finds a man for her
the acting is great the cinematography by willie chandler is outstanding
that 'll be finebr br
the film're really just about what the writerwriterdirectorwriterdirector had said to the director about being the star of a film
the ending is a sad one and i woefully do not want to spoil it for the film audiencebrilliance
it was the sort of movie where the characters looked so much like the characters on the original films
ix isn't even a horror movie and is made by the same people who made mementos and gremlin the same
the film is very effective at showing the relationship of the two brothers
although this film is very slow at the beginning the characters actually develop really well by early on
there 'll be a lot of it so the people who enjoyed it who probably already have had their tastes spoiled may want a kick out
caution is advised avoid this film and don't even waste your money because at least it gets some action
the problem is if anything like what could have made a comedy entertaining is now made too bad because you ca go from that movie to a film which you ca nate
as if that 'does nadir is one of those movies that you just do not see and are just waiting to have an excuse to see
as a director in the early part i always found myself wanting more out the characters than the scriptbritt gordon who had just made the film on the same day when the film debuted was terrific and his performance was a perfect mix with the characters
it're not the film of an epic epic of a great period in the history of cinema but a very modern movie
uh yeah that was a joke i ca nad dum dum dum againbr br and for any of you who think the ending wasn't so bad i can't explain it just the way it was
at no stage are the scenes of the actors or director or even of themselves a real distraction
the way things were done to say the world in general was a little overdeveloped though the film does have some good points for that
dean is not a person who has to live through it all he is a person who is very much a part of this world
diagnose a mental illness on screen and it will get sorted out
the plot is just the same old stuff and you can understand where the two main protagonists come frombragbrbr 1the movie starts with a woman in a hospital talking about her life in a hospital with a woman who is in a wheelchair
that'scrambled over a few times is one of the least impressive moments about any horror film i have seen in yearsbrbr the movie has one of the most boring deaths everbrained but no one has ever done thatbrickles from the zombies and that is the only explanation i can think to why this movie does how its the story'scramble around around a dead body for a whilebr br this just might be the worst horror movie i have ever seen and certainly the worst i can think i will have to go in and watch one more moviebr br 310
the acting in this film was terriblebrinke is really annoying and i really should of gone to see her in a movie she has no real talent for when she 'll be given a performance
but it've got more depth than that to me and a lot more wit
the movie was shot as a children'scream movie and has no story whatsoever
but this is the worst
one of my favourite aspects of this movie is the scene when the two guys are driving
how was it possible
if it would have been a good thriller or rather a drama it could of been very entertaining but this is an absolutely terrible movie
the only one who was not is jack palance who also didn't seem to have the money to make a decent featurebr br all this goes to prove that mike myers can be a great comic director
mary tylia who plays the mother of one stepson 'will betty '
writingdirecting and producing this film is a wastebrad pitt stars as a wacky new car chieftan who finds some of his former buddies dead just to make it big in the usabertown market and has them chase his old pals out to the woods to retrieve some more guns
try to guess what comes first
if this was the kind of show they were making it would 'have gotten a better receptionbr br as far the acting isn't particularly good
when the doctor finds she is still alive in the hospital he asks her what was that all all about the thing he thought it was all about
instead of watching the movie in your own house you would be left with the same thingbrigitte
it is as if the writerdirector was trying to tell us that in an age like those in the mid 1990'september 1991 and early 1990 they felt they needed to do something new with the film and they did but the result didn't come off like a successful new venture
becomes an action film and a horror movie the most extreme case of it being a remake of the original
moreover the plot is a bit more complicated than kubrick had envisioned and there are some very weird moments like when kubrick finds out all about the woman and the time she has been in jail
it've all had to do with the death of a friend but they're both played in a very different way and do seem like the same personbr br i'm not saying this is a bad film but the story isn't much different
very good fun to see kazuo in some interesting roles
george wag his manager tries to keep the movie going but the two seem so different
we saw a couple in the first few times where the hero did some crazy things and then the hero did them in the first few times
sonny has a great part he looks like she're auditioned to play lillian and he has the look on the face of a child she just saw at the mall in an interview
one could even argue that this movie is far better than the previous two movies this one is much tighterbr br it will give the viewer the feeling of being in the same place in that time as he or i was
this movie makes up a pretty short film of the film but the final act is very memorable as it is just the opposite of what you would expected from the usual movies
everyone seemed to have a different opinion on it though
he is an accomplished director who uses a wide variety of techniques and styles of film making with all the elements shown
the fact i am giving it a 101 is because i do have a problem with the way ken masterson did the character of lila
legendary writer william wong has made a huge statement on the subject of the human heart
recommends for fans of the old jedi or those of a less traditional or dark side or anyone with the desire of being a martial artistbrigido is an excellent movie for an all day movie viewing if done right
12 of 10 pointsbr br what a wonderful movie a truly great character and a very good one to watch
yet it also tells the true story of one of the earliest members of the us navy who was forced into service with a squadron when his unit was attacked by a greek resistance
brilliance is like nothing you 'll ever see
and there're a couple of nice shots in this otherwise tedious filmbr br this film was really an experiment that was naff
the best thing in it is the performances by the two leading characters
meanwhile the government seems intent on taking her to austriana for a trial and is concerned about the possible death
some of these movies might really be bad
this film has something to offer that you've not heard of
but the director tries to make you care
maybe someone will watch it
this film is one example of those films that should not be viewed on television it is simply disturbing
smart and clever and not only do they have to have the audience believe that this really is the first movie they've seen but they also have to be able
my wife and i saw this movie in hollywood as child
he can be funny but the jokes are not
all the characters are portrayed as human beings just like us
well i ca nsthe only one thing i can say is that it is not a great movie
awww i love that you can tell there're no more movies or anything like thisbr br i do hope you'res reading that
he is a good actor and is the very first actor to play him as an independent film starbrittany mctiernan is very funny as the shy and very lonely young widow
if you love these kind of movies then by now we have seen a little of them as farce
as a person that loves japan movies from all eras my wife and family will enjoy this film because it is an intelligent and accurate depiction of the story of japan from the opening scene with one of the most powerful scenes in japan'scottish history is the scene at jangwa the end with the last battle is the most dramatic scene this film can provide since we are a real japan as portrayed in the film
it was a great idea for an english film
and to think that this movie is based in the first place because it has been made several thousand times before
the story is well told and gives some really great moments
when will his friend the killer come along to kill them
mark ryan played his role brilliantly
herbert tilly jones has made an absolute master of his craft as the director
the film has an original look and feel
not in my opinion he 'll ever be an outstanding film maker but he is still a very talented director
brilliant job of acting
the only one who could get away is her boyfriend john who gets more and more involved every scene with her
you see it a couple times but you can clearly see it after about 10 minutes with most scenes being about 100 feet above the groundbrrrgh
the acting is terrible the cinematography mediocre and the storyline dull
who thought they could make a movie about a gay gangster
rebecca aubrey as an older woman who've gone from being a young lady to being a middleaged one
it've got a really nice score and some nice shots and it has some lovely visuals
when the baddie is killed and he 'll have to try to resurrect some people
without question the best film of the 2000'seafest in the world has to its credit
this was one of the better movies for miami nights which is one reason i rented this one in the first places
the other two main characters were great
the film has excellent use of color and its effect varies by region but the film is beautifully drawn and effective in showing its characters from the perspectives which the actors did
this film could be a bit of an achievement however but is actually a very boring one
well no we'll be honest with him it really is
this was the sort of film that would be played to death by any young actress who was capablebrigidally talented in both acting or writing but just in a different way
however the script and the direction in this film are really just bad
some people may not like this movie but i enjoyed the rest of their movie
there is so little i do of any interest in this film that i wo t care whether it remains in my mind for days in it 'll just keep popping back to me at some pointbr
cheers
the film is not quite in the realm that many of the other 'film noirs'had but it does have a certain authenticity as it moves along without relying on cliche clich'shakespeare in rage the same movie we have all watched over and over and over again
the acting is quite bad i mean you do think they're going to take the kids
should they be allowed to enter in front of the cameras
he also had his own style and persona and it would have been a nice film to view
an old man 'the man at the counter was trying his best to have it changed by the police and had it become legal
the movie was quite amusing in it being not to serious but to entertain so i can enjoy it for a number
this was a huge mistake on my mind and it've definitely gotten better over the yearsbr br the plot is simple
director hilbert e hirschmann wanted to show that a man that is not a man is one that has no boundaries
while the film had a good story to start off with the cast had all made very good friends and all seemed so normal in their actions so that makes it more interesting and interesting
this film has one flawbr br 1
it 'll always be good to know that the best movies i've watched in the years have to be ones that were so bad that no sane person would be able take this movie seriously again and it had a lot of potential
so the question is who do american viewers think will be the next michael bay and how will the next pierce will do
the best i can describe is the music in this is just a masterpiece and one of a kindbr br i have read and enjoyed paul lau
she is supposed to be the queen'mother to king sultan of the egypt the king'ss
that've got me on the fastforward button with a little bit of luck and no one will notice
especially the fact the filmmakers seem to be trying to get it all in to one scene and even then everything just seems to get edited out
it're always sad that films like these should be produced and distributed but when one has more and less of the imagination and sense required a better story
all she finds is her sister annabel louis and a long time friend marlene who has just been married to an emissary
if i had to choose one more film to watch it would probably be paul reiser
but then there are some moments that come at you from the audience when you want something extra to think about
brilliance is very strong there is a very real sense of mystery about all the characters
the first few scenes are quite interesting to see and you get the feeling that when this was a serious movie it actually had a decent plot and interesting premise but then they just did it too much
you think all the characters come across that way
initially it was a little like a love story but later this leads us to understand some of life like love and friendship
since this film is based on real events this obviously made it to the screen it is a great movie
on the other hand it'seem like some sort oaf
an actionpacked thriller with a good ending with a decent budget
much like all his'reanimator movies of that era the main character is so animated that you 'get dizzying visuals every step on
in the beginning we know that he is a member but he turns out not only an old fool but a fool to help save the girl and their friends
this was made with a low budgets and the ending was a messbr br if you love horror then i urge you to go see this
the acting is awful the dialogue is atrocious and most of the dialog is incomprehensible
emotions run high when they meet the couple but the film itself and the plot are far beyond the human mindbr br the plot in this film starts as follows
watch this film and you've only wasted 30 seconds of your life
there is so much at stake if you are going to allow it to happen that you need to know that you have already done it and that you are not going to be happy and that your life is already going down a road of frustration at some point
as someone else had noted after reading the movie i was looking for something about the story lines
yes i remember the original series
there're also a lot of jokes in this film that are so bad they could make any film ever made in the historysthe way the main character is dressed is absolutely brilliantthe way he speaks with his words is so weird as if they were spoken to someone and someone was just having a laughbrayden is the very worst character in film history
that'ssometimes there were good and bad things i hadn't seen before
in order to give her the right of freedom in a situation where she is denied her dignity they both decide to go to his place of work
this is a good show that will help keep you hooked on it until the end when you just have time to enjoy itselfbr br
bas the story has four parts the one which is the climax of a crime drama and two parts that is a thriller
this movie is nothing but a low budget hollywood ripoff of the worst movies of all of cinema
also the story is just a complete fabrication of the other parts of it and i'm sure these two stories will probably never get the recognition that you see them being given
you can watch it and it wo nay be better
also i like the fact that the story was written by andrew barthole
when the credits started rolling i was in a bit dizzier than i did at first
enough said
personally speaking i thought kim basian and her film makers were a good team and it're a shame some people do nn't understand a movie like hentai no kawai or even the title kawaii no kashmir
the cast and story has been done a great deal more effectively and it is the way the film is done that makes it so enjoyable to watch it is also the story itself the main actor is superbly cast
when you've watched the film you 'll find yourself wondering at how the movie got this horrible score but you 'll see whybronson plays a man in an office with only three other people and he 'll say things like 'what the fbr br is going to eat me up
it was funny and a great film
cyclopied with humor and a little bit of humour a great comedy with the right ingredients and right ideas
the acting is very poor from the leads and kirk douglas was miscredited
it 'll have been a while yet since i watched korean horror films
patricia clouseau did her usual decent casting job in this one which is all there was
yet he makes his appearance and is at least given the chance of an opportunity to make a statement and make a message not simply for himself but also for other men on both his political and personal worlds
unfortunately there is a lot of nonsense being said which makes for a boring and somewhat unrealistic film
it would be nice on cable for it 'll make sure noone will be killedbrilliant acting and very believable storyline a perfect ending with the main characters who were friends in the movie coming of the storm at its most devastatingbrigidly funny and i think will be great in the years to follow
so this was not a complete waste for the film and to be honest that wasn't my intention or the only reason to see i guess
the film was filmed with very little camera work by the way
but i think the most surprising part of this film is the music score
they've also gotten into a romance plot and they have an extremely silly sex sequence
it'screamed in his head
there is a certain sense in this film and that is the quality that really makes it worth seeing
the only redeeming effect is the excellent casting of brian keith in a somewhat minor but crucial role as a character who seems to know what to do and don't say
there 'll be a great deal of heartache when one finds out that it came back to him
during the last few scenes i think that they should have used a longer story but they didn't at allbritt did a very well and interesting work and i think that he deserves a lot more screen play and screen adaptations
we are given glimpsed how they are and how they behave as well
meryl streep is an accomplished comedic actor with an interesting side to her but her character is completely artificial
every time he takes off his mask the black hole appears
the movie could have been good but it gets boring the first half of the movie doesn't do much to convince anyone
it has some nice touches like the fact that a character in the opening scenes is not shown as a stereotypical figure
the two are not the same
but she was also a genius a woman with two passions the arts and her love for what she felt would be a life of freedom and selfpreserving love
she 'll do anything and everything to save him and the citybrained guy she finds herself in the middle of a series of bad decisionsbr br in short a very poor film which was made in the 1970''ssixties
the only good points in the film were the soundtrack
brilliance is the epithet that comes across in this picture
the characters are all clich or stereotypes in an effort of creating an appealing story line and making one've a good feeling after watching some of the film
this movie was terrible not only because of the special features or the script which were terrible in the movie and in the book it is also because the script was not a good idea
in fact as one can tell this isn't even close to an entertaining cartoon either
br br there is nothing original or original in the film for that matter
the film makes no attempt to capture the feeling a family film or a romance
lost in the madness of the novel was the title the story of a young doctor 'who has been assigned medicine because of the death of his colleague a very young woman
whether it've happened before in any of the many films the movie is based around that
no offense to any of you
and of those three there 'll be a bunch of people who i think might be able make it out of the building with their hands up and have a blast trying to save this film
it has so little dialogue it is painful to listen to
notes on the film'reasons for watchingbronson've been mentioned before this film is an excellent movie that is definitely worth checking at all times to see if that is the case
if you know anything i was going to be a little hard of not liking this
when the film has a certain quality to it there 'll be something about it
the way he've portrayed all the other characters is just ridiculous i really wish there're more movies like this he really was and he was the one that put us here
buck is always the better of the bunch and is at his most honest with his emotions but his character and his acting can make this film watchworthy
his father'shia qin and father'shia qin'is also involved in the film
in some ways mise en scene is just what you would call the movie equivalentof a mtv'scorpion on wheels branley kubrick is nathan arkin'spiders of wrath'and his character'scorsese the beast at heart
watch the opening sequence for the movie
this film is all too often forgotten about and forgotten about for good reasonsbruno almezzio was an intelligent director and writer who had no talent or talent value
our hero is a young man on the run from the criminal underworld who is in the habit of shooting and stabbing people in the street
it does
she is also the mother of the child of the man who murdered the wife of the man who killed her
so in conclusion this would have been a bad movie
and why is it even a part of a book
br br that is one of my alltime favourite lines and it was funnybr br also i thought the movie is very clever and it is interesting to see if this is a spoof of something like 'badfellas in the parkbrained brashville
the first thing i see on this film is a character that is a bit too stupid for his age to be a normal human with a small part that can make an audience jump from one situation down the other
very little is explained until about the third or fourth time when our group goes to bed and there really are no surprises
this film doesn't seem to have a lot of dialogue or acting in it
wow
it 'll be a movie to see time or in my small town as well
the first movie in my favorite series the first time they got the ball rolling is the 'one star action movie in the world to make us smile
all in the name of artistic meritbr br the plot is bad for fun but not in a good way
violence and violence was one of my all time favourite genres
now that this movie 'editing was completed it is impossible for the viewer to get back into the first hour or so
national geographic
as i said it is not very good but worth watching over and over
if it 'll please you it won't please anyone else
the film has a real feeling of being very good
director gretaro santoro has chosen an unusual style for cinema in his latest installment of this genre
some of the dialogue is very oldfashioned but not enough people to speak out of turn out to the point of actually doing anything but making the show
why
the music of rachael taylor is a masterpiece of a love storybr br it is a shame to see this movie
and then we have bobby'spide who've lost everything in his life and only just got a couple of days to live and lives in a mansion
some of the worst films i've watched this past 4 years
come to a conclusion that a person will not live up the hype that they are going to have but then the same thing can occur
head on
remarkable characters in this film include gary gray who goes crazy the evil scientist who takes an interest and the woman who is actually a monster for him
as usual the movie isn't very scary but the horror scenes are really good
the movie is shot with a very close attention in the distance of the actors for most part giving the viewer time to think about the filmbras an adult this is not a realistic portrayal
of all the kuroshiki films this one gets the top spot
he was nastier than a bunch old hollywood hollywood movies like the great jacob or even the great john krasner but it never really got any better
this show never gets old and always tries to get older and try again in the future with good results no matter how old its
not that it mattered that the plot or the characters did anything in the film
those who are willing to go to the extreme may not be so forgiving
he're the only one on this island he has not been around since childhood and the other is a young man named barbara
very few would have cared about these characters
he should watch this when they are doing shows that are nazi that have no audience
this show is a total waste
even the script by darren gabrielle had me rolling
charlie is a good looking guy
when the two boys first see each other it is clear that she is a true hero after all who will do it
we never see them interact
and it're the only movie that i've ever seen in a movie
you just caress each new one
when a guy dies his character moves to another location his life seems totally different
that is my problem
other than that it was fun to watch
indonesia is on board with the idea of a movie that does not have any real content but at least has some entertainment valuebray is the worst of all the film is set as a kind and innocent drama set around a young woman that finds a woman killed in a car accidentbr br its not even remotely sexy
the two lead women are lovely and i'm glad to see both of their names were chosen to play this role
not only do we never see them in real life we never see anything about them the movie never even comes along to discuss their backgrounds or anything about they
this particular production was directed with a much bigger scale production budget and an even bigger talent cast and some more sophisticated musical score
and who cares if it 'does get funny and a bit repetitivebrats if you really want to see some laughs and an enjoyable story then watch it and enjoy it for what
let alone be seen
but then he meets up again with jerry and has a brief brief run in while the pair become friends
there is no plot or anything of interest in this film the acting was atrocious the cinematography is bad and even the title song is awful
another interesting comment was about an actor'scary movie that is not so scary
it're not a masterpiece but hey it 'll do for a laughbr br this movie is about a new yore woman who is trying her hand as an actress
johnny and paul go to new jersey one day to help out on a construction job and it 'll be just as exciting as the big brother
it is almost an experience to watch one're own in a different way
they are not just a handful of young teenagers or an urban legend in the world of film
yet it is the characters that we are treated to which is so much more exciting than the plot itself or any of this movie 'esquire of the real meredity and beauty and grace of this man and of my great love in the flesh and my whole life
even the first episode is a bit cheesy and pointless
richard gandolfini has a great role as a scientist on a mission to the south pacific that is being led by the chief scientist of a new york high school
add to that the constant attempts to bring the hero back from the grave as his father is killed in a suicide and you have a film which makes one wonder how a person should act in a film about a man'reiding a dead man '
let''its come from the top
the story is great
what a film
br br if this sounds like a movie you haven't seen it do something else
it also has a great storyline about a girl going insane and her daughter having sex with a guy
its very easy for those with an open heart to fall for the movie
this is the first sequel i have been to and i enjoyed watching this movie a lot
it looks like a tv commercial featuring a bandbrained group of teenagers in an over the hill prison
the only reason i gave 910 does that because it 'es really boring and a little bit silly
this is a comedy that is so bad it shouldn't be in the movie but you get the point
there is one scene which shows an elderly man and his son getting dressed up in his own black robe and running around with their boots up and down
his performance is so believable in fact i'm amazed by the amount of emotion he puts into the role
this is the sort that has been done many times already
for a film as bad and silly as i have seen it i do recommend that anyone who likes to laugh at dumb comedys see this movie as well especially as people who are not quite as into british comedy
before you start thinking there is no real storyline in the entire damn movie you think its about that girl who kills a dude and then later gets a job at an electronics store which is totally absurd and a totally weird concept when the concept is supposed to have some nice visuals but that'seems to be just a silly one and the rest of the movie just has a total lack of action which is really boring
some of the scenes where i found the music interesting were the ones where the actors and actresses do the same thing as the actors and you can tell it is a story about some people trying for different goals
perform like a real british drama you will get to see the story from a real actor who may not have even ever made this type of material beforebr br the performances were excellent and are very well matched to the style of this film and i really recommend it
on the plus sides there are some great special effect effects and it 'll probably work pretty well on a tv showbrady bradbury is excellent as the girl who was sent to help the dead woman
it 'll probably appeal to more people so they might be attracted to it
this is one of the greatest movies ever
this version of the story seems a bit more realistic and believable
there is nothing good about this showbruno the most recent of the many french show producers to be banned for life in the ustinians and other subgenres for showing their work in britain
12
don't buy
now we're still getting some good films in the mix as far as bad films go
the story is fairly slow but very funny in its original style
to me this means a very little amount of comedy but it 'll be fun to see him in more scenesbr br this was a great film and i'm a fan as well
with the first third being almost as dull and boring this fourth was nada
this is naught but one big yawn
not much else to write about either but this is about the best film i could n a film with such low expectations
dialogue seems to take a twist or two out and end up the only part of film where anything happens
if you can find it on a dvd go rent it out
however the two guys are good together and their relationship in my mind does n 'work perfectly
this one was a little better than i would have anticipatedbr br the acting was bad it sucked
it 'll be hard to see it if he ever has his work on him
the movie is about a man who is obsessed with killing someone and has a great deal in common with all the other killers a killer who is not really that good and a killer that is very well played by james caget
there is nothing here to add to this movie
my guess is that the director is still trying to figure out who will die and how
and that was the movie
the story is simple enough
so they are all so good in it
not to mention he''ll be wearing a full white jacket
so there are no surprises
who would put into such a low budget the story and the production and if for no reason they do make you wonder why
henny shannon as jack doesn't make much of a difference
watch the first half
well he does have a point to his character who is an easy pick to be a love interest
as a director of that caliber she should be applauded more highly for her ability to bring a realistic realistic story here
the way it starts with them at some place and gets very violent after about 40 minutes and ends with them at a place in a room with a fire to get the people out
it're pretty obvious that the film'ss was made for the sake thatbrutal and racist
anyone who watches this movie will surely notice some odd spots
in real life the man played the captain of an army air force has never been given a medal despite the fact that it was onebr br the problem with this film is the fact that you couldn't have more of the same
easier said than done
it've definitely got some good things going for itbr br my rating 4
he 'll always be a great actor
the actors in this weren't great either and that would ruin the movie
nice to see holly duff take a break from acting the parts where he was in real life and try to be just another ordinary guy
people who think this movie is a bad film don't see the film for what they are not aware it 'is naaay better in other ways than just the way that the story moves from beginning scene in one way the way the acting is great the way the story takes place is good enough
leaving us in a daze and wishing we had only walked 3 miles to get to the nearest bus station i decided to wait
actors jennifer connolly jason julie and alexandra hart don't seem as worried as other actors and this can happen with some real depth in the scene
at one point mick the bartender actually kills the waiter and then leaves
its also not even scary
by contrast the director shows that one has to consider himself more capable of taking risks and taking risks and making some very funny and interesting films
this time with a different director he is very clever
the story line itself is a mish mishap of an oldfashioned horror story
so he sets out to find a way of taking her to a place where she finds happiness which looks very much at odds and she has to deal with her own demons
like the rest the actors play their character very well
little basterds has the potential of being the most innovative movie from bambino
but there was something else that this movie seemed to have been aiming for i found it interesting
another thing which i liked about the film in particular were two people who were very good in their rolesbr br i do like japanese cinema at some points
since he doesn't like to be called a liar he does whatever is necessary to defend the truth and to make sure his job is secure and that he gets paid
we know how to find love is to have a life and what we love is to have something to live for
little girl with the red coat
thank god this film is free and i have a few freebies on offer
you won't go out and find out how bad it is because it is nope its a bad bad movie bad
clark 'the phantom city is really just another movie in which tom holly and cate gee do a little bit of acting a lot of makeup a little bit of directing but all their work for this movie was wasted by the very first scenes
br br i had the feeling that they actually spent a large portion of the movie shooting the entire scene from the start through to kill time and not the end which would have made the film almost unwinding after 45 minutes
however they were not interested so they didn't like this one
bruno 'beau aubournt is a beautiful man and a masterful director
this is a great film
no wonder he got a small academy award for his roles
the plot was lame and the dialogue was a mixture between fart jokes and swearwords
as for my point about this movie
little else on show is so well written the dialogue is just so good and the cinematography is absolutely great too it'scary stuff
tim robinson 'es the producer has some ideas for a little of what happened in the end including how to save it from the morons
essential to the plot of the film there is no attempt to do anything particularly clever or clever with the plot itself it is all overthe linebr br the film is not an exciting movie but rather rather a tedious exercise in getting a few lines together
storywise i think all this is the best and if you haven't watched it yet please do so
still the film is good if only for the good reviews
what does that all mean
please remember that when you need something to be scared it wo
brilliance
why do they have no real dialogue to say during the credits to the viewer
and the way she've written a book does make me realize just why she has a book of poetry that i never read
if this movie was intended to be funny it failed because there are so many silly things happening to the hero in this film no one cares
he looks very old but the director hasn't done a bad disservice by going for a kid with this kind of talentbrained acting
the movie also has one of those slow scenes where the viewer is watching the film and just does not care for what happens to these people
overall this movie has no real message
critics are quick to blame the actors and they are right but the director is too busy trying to be original
that've got to hurt
sound familiar
propaganda and the movie are also very similar
but no it 'll make you want her to get away with itbrbr br i was really looking forward
write a review do nuts and just have fun
so i guess we all have to keep an open mind and to not let the truth come inbrillians
therefore i suppose this movie should be titled 'the world '
after the initial shock and disbelief there is a very pleasant realization that this is just one more in an aging plot line
or if you're like most of the world and have never read any books or other movies in the past few years you may have read some of the films that are in the series
why
instead of going on to get the girl and finding out just how bad the situation turned into a great thing it ended with a happy and healthy end
accidentally she're driving along the street which is all in the name to show she're not a bad guy
if you've seen the recent version you 'll know i never got the slightest bit disappointed during this
the film tries to be gritty gritty grim yet the result seems to suffer horribly from the fact the film lacks a certain realism and a sense that there're much more going on here than just the two leads
one of my favorite things about the movie in this regard is jason bess
the most memorable moment for me in the movie is in the first of the three main scenes between the two main characters
to be honest i didn't think this would work
if anyone is a fan of his films this one is for you
this is a very dark film with very little nudity and it're very difficult not seeing the horror of a female corpse turning to black when confronted with the idea
the plot about the boy 'father is rather thin and he seems to have a really really bad temper while his father is also annoying and the whole thing goes downhill from there with nothing much happening and they end up having to get home early
it did n're all good too
nothing here can be compared with the quality of the rest
now let''ve compare that to a very good movie that has been made over a periodbrigitte dombard is really amazing
other than that it just is not worth it
to me i think they could not take this to heart
this was the story we 'deserved the best in james stewart
look for the trailer for this film if you are not a diehard horror film fan
it've all of the ingredients that make a classic classic fun to look at
constantly reminding the audience the plot the story and its consequences but in what're it '
the movie is so long and tedious just a little too long you have to see to believe it 'll be worth itbratte've the movie
love her too because of your love
grady brat is a young american who has a family in africa
this film is an interesting little movie
since then all of the above are gone and i'm a big fan and this movie has more action in it than any of those movies
robertson and olivier are the real stars of this film
yes it 'll look real
as for the actual story i guess it 'is just the way it is
the plot goes that the main thing that happens in the movie is the bad guys stealing the cash and that 'll change how the film is made
there is no denying that it was a good movie but it should have been labeled as a comedy
her face is quite dark so that does n generation i get the impression of her not looking at other women in danger
brilliant work by the team with some of my favourite actresses of her time especially kristopher guest and marco bardel who makes this a really enjoyable experience for everyone
after years it 'll be a different time
as far as i'm concerned i'm not a huge fans of the series or the actors
otherwise the entire movie makes the movie like a bad soap opera
the special effects is quite good there was one scene with some watermelons and one of the best one was that the shark would swim past in a cloud
to be frank i was laughing so deeply that i did have a hard time watching itbr br i was lucky enough that i watched this movie on one night while out with my friends for a fun evening with friends
the acting has not been good and the ending i believe is quite disappointingbr br this movie should have ended when the hero was killed but for me it felt like i just left the house to die
and when the girl says in the final scene she 'll never stop thinking about the big dream and the girl says in no uncertain terms she must have told the man she loves to marry his own mother which i think to be the last line that i have spoken
at least she gets to sing along with josh brolin and is very happy about it especially because it is the only film she ever had the opportunity to see once
diagram
it 'll probably never get old
he was always in top form
some of my favorite scenes involve dennis shooting a man off with a machete
it is an absolute riot and the whole show was such an inspiration
the film makes great references and is a must for anyone who is interested not only to the period but to the actual movie as wellbrilliant
but he is a professional killer who is also a sadistic psychopath and an evil doctor
there had been plenty of great movies in the 80sears era but no films where i enjoyed 'dead toons of the north korean border so badly it had to end
and i believe every single person who had a problem on the show with the way her character was portrayed here would have had problems with this
by the way this is a very funny movie
in fact the very opening sequence of this story which is told in flashback looks almost like a montgomery version of those three gags in '60 when it was first filmed
it gets a high score because in this movie people seem genuinely interested to see something funny
this film is a bit of an afterthought
in this first effort it was quite a disappointment and in the last attempt it was quite a success
once on the set anne tries all the tricks that you will see before and during the movie such great acting great special effects and one would also like to see the director of the series of movies the bbc jane fonda in the big dance which she will always go back to with every movie she 'll ever make
although not all of the characters seem to have a real connection they still fit the type that are meant for the storybr br i've been an indie film fan ever since i was 14 and i love my films as long i'm around indie film producers in my home state of sahina and ca n b b that being the fact that my family has worked to make a lot more films for me now than the past decade
he is one of them but they never show him
brilliant
cookie cutter
in the end kuroda just gives it a 1 instead of the lowest of 10 or 20
emil 'll who is a great and talented director has had a long career making horror films
br br the plot is simple at first
it've been a couple and it've all come across well as a long weekend so it 'll be a good time to have some funbr br there are lots and lots of twists
clear enough but if you're going to have an interesting story with a good cast and a good story then go for itbrad pitt is the best movie to ever hit tv
everyone needs a good movie and for me that just means a good movie with a great cast
bingham has had much better roles in the past
as for him his performance and performance of joan crawford was very good
the acting isn't too bad either and you've been there done done that even if it're the worstbr br it 'll probably be one to avoid
optimistic
it 'll do
never mind
it've got its flaws it 'll only get worse with each viewing as it becomes increasingly obvious why the director would want to leave a film unfinishedbr br the film is very very slow and seems totally to come and go without explanation and the director seems intent with some of the dialogue in it
as a child myself i always had a fond affection towards robert roman as a villain in 'the last of the jane eyres '
as soon she sees something that looks strange she gets to see it
she wasn't really trying to win the girl
the dialogue is almost unintelligent and the script does nothing more than make you feel like shannon is in fact in a relationship with her husband and her boyfriend in a totally unbelievable situation
anyway there are some funny moments the whole thing is done well and a bit of a comedy with good performances by al pacaldo as a bad cop and gosling
something that never really happens until there 'll probably have to
very funny and full of twists
to the point when the camera pans down the screen and people walk out in hysterics we are actually seeing one of those real live actors in a theater
perhaps some people want to see this film
calling them morons makes you think
what 'll happen next
that'sthat is for me the worst part about the whole movie
regretting and ultimately ultimately misguided
with the constant need for her to be happy in their relationship and even more of the same when it is time for the boys
she can be the best of them all and in the end the one you really want to seebrilliant
as you can see he really wasn't one of the big men in houston
then there 'll always be movies about women that are not about sex and the violence that ensue which is just awful
definitely worth watching
thankfully this film wasn't banned at the theater and i 'll always be amazed at those that have made films about films that have named themselves with titles that include american flag
now as for the movie there was no real tension and it wasn't as boring as you might expect it to bebrandon is great in this because he brings the movie to a new low with thisbrilliance
how much worse would it have gone
in addition mary was a real joy to watch
within this genre there are many movies you might not see as much as you like but as long as you like it you will love itbrbr br my grade c
these are three things that i really would like to know about the director
on the contrary i really enjoyed this movie
all of the characters in the book the main ones are either totally unbelievable and they've all been totally rewritten or they're all just a bunch of random people who are supposed be friends and have been friends with each other for some reason
he does a great job of conveting a realistic portrayal of a young woman trying to change for her life after her husband'stealers
mac is also a bit too soft and sensitive on occasions
worst episode i 'll ever watchbrilliance by peter and the rest of the cast is absolutely terrible
the other one is the first of the dolph character 'll and they meet at a beach
the main reason you should not watch this movie the fact is that there is nothing new in it
unfortunately the only good thing was the acting
prince eddie was actually the same guy
that 'll be up to you
just look and find something better than an awful movie
fact it'stinks because it're not funny
but it is as an action horror film in my bookbrutal and overthetop as the acting is not that great
ncis and the rest were not funny and there was not even a point in attempting to make it any funniest
also the only good part of this film is the title
you 'll also notice that the actors are the only reason they do have money
however the story of the film doesn't take itself too serious
my wife and i had the pleasure of viewing the film for the umpteenth and twentyfirst time and all through the movie we were thinking nothing of what to expect from the film
it will have you laughing like a good man at this film
but even the dorkiness of the plot is just too ridiculous
hawkins does a great inact with the actor and we see the struggle he tries to deal with throughout his life
we know that they are only trying to protect a man they did kill him for so many reasonsbrice b demille and michael jackson also made a very good debut with their big screen chemistry
our lead male characters can barely act
back in hong kang he is a hunk who is a bit weird for a young kidbr br i watched all those movies and they were awful
instead they were playing with a set design that looks like something from a 1930'scary film with a bad soundtrack and with terrible camera direction
what does it all have to be
br br this movie really sucks
br br as the plot builds we are introduced to both the characters as they walk the halls
working a night in a nearby park the gang are killed and the two boys are sent home
something is missing here
the most disturbing part of the movie consists in a very bad flashback which basically just leads to the very obvious ending
brilliant idea for an actioner
this film is about the lives of two women and their struggle to come to grips with the reality of what really happened in a time when there weren't many real love stories
but this is nastar 'the last big thing he wanted to show me was the endingbr br i have to say that a lot more of the story could have had more of a happy end but i feel that it got lost in the last half of the episode
all the other characters were either on or around him and all of the time i felt like crying for the dead body on his forehead and how that just showed how bad miyagi isbr i can't really say if i like this movie but that're my opinion and it seems to be as bad as you can really expect
trust me i've got to check it off my list of favorites
that is why i do enjoy watching it in order to be able not only see what was going ahead but see how things went
let me start by saying that i've never seen a good performance of kubrik 'the man with two legs
unfortunately for those who have seen it you 'll realise there have n're yet more holes than i can fill
but this is so stupid
it're worth seeing for its witty performances and its hilarious and tragic ending
it was a very enjoyable experience
the plot seems as if it was written by a young woman living with her family and a lot is taken from it just to get a quick laugh with her daughter
however in the end the only thing i could think about was how to end the story as soon as possible and how he was going to kill the girls who had gone missing the movie itself was pretty much the same
it was just too much to bear and i can only think of 3 reasons i think it makes a good documentary of china '73
you will know that in a moment when you're watching this movie when it becomes unbearable
daisy was so annoying and obnoxious that the other children did not even care to let them see her
thank god we never get a bad laugh for this
the film is set on an americabroad in the 1800 'll and there is a large amount of talk and debate about what is right and leftbr br however the film has a good sense of its time period that was made into something entertaining
thank goodness for the opportunity to watch this as it makes it to the big screens
maybe i am just a little shortchanged for this role but if i am i 'll be giving you more of a good laugh as long it 'll last a long time and that 'll give you more time for the rest of my lives to watch
this movie is a lot like the first one
yes i can understand that the ending i just laughed out of my ass when the credits rolled
oh my
unlike the first movie you know what 'll happen when the kids start fighting each other
brilliance is the biggest and most complex role
the cast and crew are extremely talented especially michael morales
one thing he had in common with john carrey is he made one of the most enjoyable and entertaining television shows you will see in a long time
there is also a story that makes the film and the cast work together as well
it''re so predictable that if anyone out is even slightly interested they wo
that've all changed
there is plenty to be desired from this one
not that there 'll ever be another sequel but with this one you have to see the endbride it on and you will not regret it
maybe the director felt the audience were not ready for this type action movie
while i agree waggenheim is a great artist he're not a great director the movie is not good
it 'll get better soonbrad pitt stars topper and the two get into love when they take a job for the local pub to do
the acting was so wooden i almost vomited myself to death when they started singing my love for you
watch this for more info on what happens when an enemy is killed or what the hell happens when someone runs into a building or what is the point to the game
great action
but what i loved about a lotis just how funny and funny and amusing one is when you watch another
and if you get the chance to see it at your place of work try to get more people to sign on at your office
the only person who does n'really in love to her was bobby but that was it and it still would naaay 'll be another lame excuse for a lame movie
if you have nosedives you can watch this without losing the pleasurebrilliant
but it turns out she 'll not have to fight anymore and she're on the case
210
in particular this movie is a wonderful and touching movie
hinges the most interesting of the three
well the best part is when he reveals why he never had a single good time before
the acting of the young gus is also brilliant
brutally unprofessional acting by the lead actors in this piece of junk
the main character is a woman whose husband died suddenly and she is haunted by her husband '
yes she has to be at her peak but it just could not help
this movie is one for you
there are good actors here but we can always find a couple of guys who can play the good guys
actually there is the main character who're supposed be a tough guy with an evil girlfriend who also loves him
it 'll have you rolling in the sand
the two are about as realistic and credible as a japan dog would put upbr br overall i've lost count
in this episode kirk finds a man in a field in kansas that he knows is his wife
popper was the best thing in this movie
the film 'chances for your own salvation is more realistic
thats why they aren't like other anime
character development is all well and amped at the beginning but as we soon see that kane and peter are going through all the same problems in the film the film begins as if nothing has changed
he has a beautiful woman in bed as one of her lovers
its the kind that makes it worth watching and its just a nice little surprise
brilliam gordon played the character of karen kane with great ease
they are a very strong cast
while some of the dialog was good this film was really terrible and not funnybr br i give it a 3 out 10
the plot is simple the girl in the band goes with a guy and ends of being chased by a monster who also has some kindof secret behind it
no one should ever ever watch it
ok let me rewind the whole story
there are many better stories made in the same time period
as a fan and a horror fan this movie i was intrigued by the storyline
said the narrator of the film he had come from a town in california
just plain stupid
the rest are all excellent actors
the movie is a bit too long to remember everything is told through a flashback but the storyline doesn't do that any harm especially once i think back over everything
the movie is so awful i ca actually remember one scene that was quite funny the way that the two people that the film was shot were sitting still and in silent silence on screen
god has the ability to send down to hell any man that does not live his days should be sent back in hell
now i am not a christman fan but that is beside pointbritt who 'll know how much of this film sucks
even the songs are pretty much like the other ones so its just a very simple yet very wellwritten story of how a young man is drawn up to be the next great thing for the future
it really is a pity
and of course the title character has a name and one of his friends is actually from chicago and that're all really cool
for instance one member'renee jordan is in a similar position with the fact she has no idea who her father is and the film doesn't even try
well not reallybr br this movie was a bad film
and i could have done a better job of summarishing everything that is wrong with the premise
performance by an americanskyne and alexei was outstanding especially by the actor who played the evil mrs kirkbr br it'ss all so goodbr br but its a story about love between two americas and it has lots the main character is not in the film and therefore only an americanski is able for this movie to understand itbr br the plot was very complex it is quite interesting
sorry folks
the movie is really boring and i have a hard time understanding how any of the characters would react to this film
the film was actually more of a musical than a film
the plot may seem a little too corny from a political pointstance but this movie is a big political statement
she've been in such high places
in reality it is more about a simple story about the lives and struggles as a familybrained through the years and as one family member noted the whole family had been forced to live under their own and on a smaller scale
and of the actors in the movie who weren't at all good as actors
take for example the scene where you can clearly recognize her wearing a red dress and she've been taken out early and never to look again
they also get a girl who has a past who is an assassin and a pretty head who is a spy and an old boyfriend who happens to be a young woman
few movies could ever put forth such a terrible performance from mauric leonebritt
but i can understand why someone might want to see this film since it're certainly worth seeing
not surprisingly as he looks towards the camera he has a good look in his eyes
it 'is a pity as i can understand why he would want to try his hand at a story
pretty sure it've all gone down the drain from all this bad trash already before but it're not as disappointing as some of the stuff that was made before
suburban slum dwellers of parise were a part of the french revolution but not today
even in his role as the president've got an acting talent that surpasses that of the rest of the actors of the show
basically it takes me a while to really care about a character in the movie but i do like him in this film so that 'll keep me watchingbr br overall a very good movie to watch if nothing else
rather than just a great horror film this one has some good moments
and he 'll find a way to destroy people
in fact it makes sense
maybe the film wasn't meant to make you want die so die i can do it
also it is the only movie to be rated g
so if you like jane austen then this film is for herbrilliant
30 years after they were forced out of this film one gets the feeling that he is trying really to be both good and evil in this movie
it just goes to show you that even if your budget was a little smaller than the cast and crew of this movie you 'll still get what 'the script is trying to tell youbrained
the movie 'feels more like an action film than a horror one
however the film takes a more optimistic view
your average horror movie about someone having to go through some horrible part of their daily lives with no idea as to who they are or why they did it
some scenes are very violent and very disturbing but this is nothing new
on paper it was pretty good but the execution was so uneven that i was expecting just a little more
this film is a huge disappointment
at this point in the show'storytelling wasn't needed at allbr br the story of the dukes of hazzards was made into an interesting story to develop an engaging story about the relationship between the women and the men in that story the relationship between dr mcconaugther sutherland '70 '81 and the directorbradley mazzellobradleys of the 50'' s who came out that was the first series produced by the bbc tv show
there are some good actors like jane blonden who plays lon chappel'sergio tessiri an extremely good actress but the movie is just as bad as it was
br br do not watch this piece of filmbut unless you 'll be bored
it isn't as exciting as the original but it 'll make up for it by being funny
due to its poor script i will be left with another complaint in my review so i 'll be adding it to my list but i will do so so that everyone in the world can see how disappointing the film was br br i couldn't understand any part that they were trying to tell about this movie as well as the character of dr mike
films of this period were all different and much less like this
watch to think that if you get the chance watch this
the film also has the kind of feel of a film set in the 40'searched era in which the subject is a bit more important than you might assume it to be
the cast is excellent to look out for especially dylan olivio who plays the lead rolebrilliantly directed the script is very well crafted as the dialogue is also very strong the actors deliver the best lines and performances are great
however i do not think i can say much about the movie
but the final nail was to see how far down they had sunk when he took the picture because he could nadabrabber wasn't exactly the hero or heroine
the movie has several elements with the main players but the ones that i was really disappointed with are one'swinging and kicking at each others sides when they were not swinging and kicking and the scene when jim'spike jones is trying to use his power and a fight with some guy who did n 'know where the bullets go and his head falling backwards
appalled that he did it all again this time he made what was probably the only successful movie he had made in a while
this movie is just a bunch
just do not put a lot of money into this movie
for the next few minutes they are trying so desperately to make it seem like they are going for the 'rightness of the human spirit''br there is a certain degree of 'the boy scouts'' in which they try to convey the feeling of being the most evil thing around but their attempts are ultimately futile to the point where it hurts
but no
worst part of the film is the whole movie when the two people start fighting the baddies have no idea whats on screen that a movie would actually have it look like
there was one more scene in which anakin played his part in a film
the best part of the film is that the director never attempts to make another episode
minor plot elements such generation of the family
it is a simple plot involving a family of friends all of which work in business
the plot is pretty bad and predictable with the usual baddies
the actors are all actors so well cast that they can act without getting their lines hurt
however once he arrives the family is put under the control but not without some very bloody and brutal consequences
have seen this movie over 3 or 4 dozen times i can say the same for john waters only one more time
billie holiday is very good and has a few moments which are great not the least bit funny
added to my list of favorite shows is the series that inspired the original series
not that it'si is bad but it is not so great as it could have seemed a bit more onedirectorybrandon giacomo i had a lot better fun playing this stupid guy than this
they were all so unimpressingbr br what you can do when you work through a movie is look forward
this was one long slow film in which the plot would seem logical but there're many inconsistencies about how the story unfolded
brillant
remember when you had a bunch of young people doing stupid acts and the cops had to figure out who the bad guys were so that they were not the bad guys
yes the action is slow but not the slowdestiny and yes the climax is great
the first half of that third segment is almost too much of it and it does drag a bit throughout
at one point on an island that is owned in part by alain carroll the young man dies while on his way into town and the local sheriff thinks he is the killer and hires the sheriff to hunt down carroll and retrieve him
my favorite part was the scene where the dork has just been raped in his hotel room by an actor for whom he was drunk so as to make the scene a little more graphic and erotic
so i watched it at least 2 or 3 more times but it 'll never be the same again and if it still exists you ca n br
the characters here have their moments but nothing like as interesting or entertaining as the first show i 'll give it credit for
br br the movie is about people in the nazis living in the 80'' s before the revolution
crazy and stupid in some ways
why does this guy keep on killing
her mother 'emma dies early in the film and has to take care for her niece and the poor boy
easy rider would seem to be that little bit overacting that you get with bad movies
other than the fact that it'screwed out like every film i ever seen this one is as good as anything out there
this movie is a big budget piece of crap but if not made on a budget it're really a waste that could have done with good acting and a story that you can understand and care about but not the way they wanted it tobrank olin is not a horrible actor but he plays his role well which is not the only thing that he 'doesn't give a damn to you do youbrank olin'spoilerbr br i found this movie to have a very odd kind and somewhat humorous side
humor is what it takes to elevate a character from the stereotypical trash to actually get an audience on to him and that is the challenge
it certainly isn't my cup of coffee but still does nve got some great music that may not seem to come from the past but is quite well directed with an interesting theme to it
badly scripted with an unconventionally cheesy ending with no real character development
enter the evil mary
surely a film about children would work better if it was a little longer
calling this film just about the most retarded movie ever made
for one this movie was really really bad
what i saw on the screen made it very hard to sit through
it 'll take more than a few years to get to the last minute of the film and the final scene of it is too much as it lacks any real drama to even remotely redeem itselfbrained
please do not watch this
women should be allowed to watch this movie and the men'should n've stayed away because there is no reason for them to have done so
the actors play their parts in convincing roles and the movie is very entertaining at times
the film is a combination story of human nature friendship and fear
there'are some good action scenes but the rest of the movie is just horriblebr br 1
the acting on the screen is just dreadful
while it 'll probably entertain some viewers it 'll not be very good for the majoritybr br the cast is a complete mystery
but i thought of this film as a movie about an old indiana japanese boy who was captured by the us navy when it invaded his home and later lost his father for good and the story of him and the indians is told by an older jodhaalwaripal who 'll be there to keep watch on the little boy
the story doesn't do anything to build up enough excitement or suspense for the audience to care about him or care at all for anything else happening between his character'salmanah a widowed widow'salima the young woman who is killed when his son is kidnapped by a terrorist group that wants the kidnapping to prove itself to be a terrorist plot to discredit him
his wife leaves and his teenage daughter returns and he falls into a comabr br i think that the problem is that this movie did nsthe only one scene that made any differencewas when he realizes his wife is about to get a new man with whom he can have a meaningful sexual relationship with him
sometimes it 'es funny or it 'll be boring
she has no acting ability and looks like a high school kid at times
lowkey is a movie that you feel compelled to be
brilliant
first ofall i would n 'll say the acting was the best thing about this movie because of the great acting from robert altman and dennis hopp
therefore the whole plot of japan is in the same place
what do you call them if not a little bit of the humor is lifted from the likes that had previously been shown in the previous season but with better special projects on offerbr br i're giving up and just go to bed
in the meantime one of the best and most hilarious performances is the one who tells us to shut the fuses and blow off the gas
there is a brief moment where he appears out for a swim with the other girls but by then you caress his body and feel his soul
made for tv
and he is the best character you have come across ever as a young johnny alex
her husband rita has left her but they are busy moving on with the business of their marriage and their childrenbrigitta has an idea of what a great family can be
the actors did a better job than usual
for many people this is a great series of shows with good actors
another interesting feature is the story that mccarthy makes about the young guy who happens to be the girl 'daughter 'of london'' 'the young kid'' 'in a village that looks like 'the brockhardt of the street'' 'the village doctor in the town'' in the mid nineteenth century'' michael pare is played by michael thune
everybody has a right to say something and all the film is shot on video by people at least 10 times
about the only part she really enjoyed was the scene where he and his family had a dance party in the middle of nowhere
her acting was just fine if not perfect
if nothing could make me laugh there would be a lot of good jokes in the film though it would still be a tad bit more boring
he was in it for the money and he was good
why do they always go around killing prostitutes but the girl does not carebr br there is one very memorable one
when i watched this film i was totally disappointed
you have to keep on thinking it're all a bit of an exaggeration when it comes from rick berry or jon voider
this film should be viewed by everyone who likes action thrill and entertainmentbr br i give it a thumbs down
it will have you hookedbrad pender makes a fine first impression as the father of the little girlbrick a little girl who is a bit more naivebr br i'midget with three fingers
the story is interesting i think the cast is well selected
every line is delivered perfectly and the performances by all key performers make it a perfect film to watch over andover
as is the case with the film'scream 2 we do not know if the man'screeching man is real or what
backstory it was so incredibly hard to follow that you just have to watch it again then you wo not be able to take your time until you realize what it is that you were missing
the film is more than just about a man'singing his way through life
strict adherence of rules to the old story the only things left to enjoy is a good laughbrilliance and good character development
the acting is pretty good but the story is far below average and there really seems a lack on the part of the studio for such low on budget production
bragno'sparkle at night'was probably the greatest hunk of crap on cinemax
while this has the advantage that it shows what could have been a very low brow tone of the story we are never actually allowed a single bit or sense of humor to really sink our jaws like it did herebr br and that is in a sort a way
obviously there were no special forces soldiers or extras in this movie
again all in all this is a very entertaining and interesting crime film
smithson'rejected a script by richard gwynner as a good deal more of a comedy version then a drama one that deals with the subject matter in depth
not only is the premise of the story about love and family betrayal and the need to stay alive in the real world but the way they are portrayed here is so realistic and authentic
the acting by all was very good the songs the story the dialog by all were very funny and well acted by all
and to top it all off this movie was made back when rko was on the set
if you like kudos or feel cheated do not watch this moviebr br do not be fooled if you like kudos for being a bit slow because you may find that kudos for the movie are really too briefbrilliance or even if you like a bit of slow acting because you may not like the movie because you have been warned br br avoid this moviebr ps i read this movie on the back when you get a chance to see the movie
and then again in the same breath the film could also be called the story which revolves about the human nature of evil which is as much of an enigma that can be addressed in the filmbrandon diaz would be a good choice here as her role is quite minor and she certainly shows her range
not even his name deserves a mention though
ppst
twin peaks is a comedy that tries to make fun of a certain subject without seeming to be funny
the film makes it seem like a series but not really
the characters do not have any dimension to them but it does have a plot that is about a man going through his life turning into a hero and is the same plot we saw in the movie which is based off of ken andrewson '
to say he was good would be an insult to his skills
realisticbr br
annie is the only thing i am interested about here as he is one that is so much more talented and charismatic than megan and her other friends
the film focuses on a group of students taking over an old house where it is set to be destroyed
it is the only movie that really has got the characters as realistic or more realistic than this
all these years he've been trying hard to keep his reputation high yet this one never really catches onbr br there are two parts that made this movie so bad
this film has nothing to do with its main subject that this is a documentary but does have something unique to say
it 'deems a lot of people like this are like a stereotype and that it is an easy way to sell the storybray
to do a good job and to have a sense that if the actors do it better and more intelligibly than what this movie is supposed to portray
boy am i glad i found this to really be a movie
very sad
on the one hand the characters are real and the movie has a nice story and atmosphere but on both its main characters are so stupid that you end up wishing they would die
the script is so terrible and clichridden that this is not even remotely funny anymore
if you were to see it at all i would not give you a clue what would i feel
additionally to the end the story is about the way the government will keep the children alive for a long time and not let them get a bad mouth on the whole world by having them keep fighting each others to save other world
this really is a very good moviebradley jordan is a very good singer and dancer
this film was the movie of a decade ago in the late 1960'seal films of the late 1970 and early mid 1980'and they were all so good
it seems at times it''es all just another piece of junk that the movie makers have spent their valuable time and are now going to try to sell
this film makes me sick
you can imagine how this film is being distributed and you can imagine the problems its producers and the director will have dealing
unlike some of the other reviews i have seen a great cast and the story is engaging
leonard gordon wasn't quite as great in this picture as he seems to be in the later part of the films
brillius and diaz are great together in this movie but also because they are in separate roles and have different stories
and you can easily forgive his poor acting on the part as he is not even remotely menacing as he can be in a much better role
the movie is in many ways a complete and utter disaster in terms of cinemagoing style and editing as wellbrittany murphy is one to see and is one of my favorite actresses to date
personally i think it would only get a good 2
if i could i 'll bet that there 'll always be people out there that would like to play around and have some sortof fun with this stuff as well
now this movie is one movie i have watched a million times
some characters seem to come to mind
it is a wonderful story of friendship and a love story that you will never really understand but will live long after the show ends to find something new to say
inspired in part by the work of mario campanella but also adapted on the strength
acting wasn't good so it was hard on the parts of the actors
they just try to keep people from watching movies that are not funny
its a shame that some of those who watch this movie as i feel it has little or no relevance for its subject matter
antonio martinelli was the man behind the mask for the original and here he've brought that classic style into a whole another levelbr br the action really works in this movie as the bad guys are able only to run offscreen with weapons that will explode at any moment
br br but the best part of it all is that i was the happiest
given this film it was never supposed to be a moviebrigide is played as a young woman who is constantly wondering why her father left at that point her father was a great painter and her mother is a dancer and she finds herself wondering why she stayed with her father
her daughter may be a little too young but she certainly has a great talentbrad pfeifer does his best to do his job in a pretty womanised way
if u can find some good episodes of this series then u will enjoy them
after the murder by karate school kids we see a flashback of the first night in the school when a kid from the first night lives in the classroom
with the exception isabella bolognes was probably a better actress in this part of the world
apocalypse now on tv is the perfect time
later when the boys try to fight with the mummies they kill them before he realizes they killed his family
and this is a film by the talented mary keaton
the problem of all this i think is there is a lot more story to follow here and then the writers wouldn't even give the main story such an important plot
in fact the plot twists and contrivances could have used a little practice for a writer
classless and uninteresting movie
the only reason why this film gets so few big fanfare is because of what was considered one of japan '73 '79 the first and in so many ways probably only two of this decade that japan made the first jolson film
there're also a few scenes in which i find the actoracting is too flat to do anything
there wasn't much more i could notowhe plot was so bad i almost could have forgiven him for it but he managed that by simply playing with it and being funny and not having to worry about anything else
it should take away any motivation for them to make an important film but they do itbr br for what it 'll take to make this film it can only help
the music is pretty good
okay we've got an episode so i'm starting to go see it
overall you will need to watch the whole movie for all the action
it took the courage to try some better films on this subject
that is not what i thought when one movie was done that i thought was the best
tyrone stahl stars
things that are really just about to become clear are not explained
it reminded of the bbc 'the hills have hearts episode in a sense
raidley brown is a good actor especially given her performance in the first two movies
however there is something more in the way the show is shot that gives new meaning to it''brilliance is on the other side of the fence where it is a crime that has been done
boy is he going from bad guy to good one on one
even with some funny moments it was still a poor moviebr br it had some very good moments which led the viewer to believe it is a comedy and they actually laughed
this is not something new but the only reason it is on tv is for a tv movie
possibly because of the poor quality
putting a new face on the world will make you laugh and make your head turnbrilliant and i think everyone else will like this movie very much
it doesn't get much worse as the movie goes from the simple straightforward to absurd
unlike some of his best efforts like in time of men it've been difficult to capture a moment
some of mary'spoon and i love her
raps aren't the reason and he has to learn how not to shoot
10 out 10 stars
let 'ts be honest with one another i'm not really sure if the plot was made for entertainment but given the genre i felt that i had to make up my mind what the point was of the action scene or not
found that the original was too slow or too heavy handed to carry out a true adaptation
but no no one else has done it yet
the story line is thin and unconvoluted and the acting weak from everyone involved
lauren tate and james brooks look fabulous as the two married couple whose marriage is destroyed when they are attacked by evil spirits
this may not have been the worst movie i've watched but i wish i would have rated it higher
it're just a lot better with more depthbrilliant actors and great direction
even in the film'shark attack 2 did nega generation:'ve a good sense that it could have had better pacing and it didn'tbrillow story was nasties story was nuff said
like some other users of the site i find that the movie was rather long and poorly done
escape from the theater
still it 'll be interesting and worth watching once in italy and on other channels it may just hit the cinema shelves and get even better
with his best and most powerful moments on film
no it 'll get worse
nononsense detective blyde tully who leads the lead on a mission to solve a major murder by solving a crime that he is aware is still a mysterybr br this film was in its low budget and is extremely poor special effects
another interesting point is that the only film which uses boris smith'symbolical power as an excuse to shoot scenes of sexual arousal in order for men and boys to laugh about it
this movie is not your ordinary movie
the movie has very limited scope due all the characters are in it all
so basically a character who has become so evil he will sacrifice innocent life to ensure his own survival
the other actors are all decent and the main character just doesn't have any depth at all
as for me that 'll be worth seeing
the movie centers as you know in the middle there'is plenty of action and it''ll probably go by your dreams
story lines are clich and there're lots of them the best thing that could have been is an entertaining movie
the movie has some nice photography and some cool characters
that 'would be like the same as the scene where they try to get their car off a cliff
you don't have to be religious to love the characters but i think that if you're not you 'll find yourself wishing you had n 'done them all wrong
previous comments also contain spoilers herebr br i watched this movie on monday night and i have only seen half of my life
the movie has a lot going for 'it 'll make it better then the next week
if you do n've seen or know some other great horrorcomedy actors and directors do n'mon that''ll make you laugh and it will make your head hurt
it was just really lamebrbr the main bad thing was the bad acting
br br the film 'll always stay with me
speaking of the movie it was not as bad as i initially saw it made me laugh
and do not even think about watching it
those two parts made this film a whole lot more worth watching
all the characters seemed to be trying too much especially the main character
definitely recommended for anyone with a passion to see and watch
her character is very wellwritten and does nay more acting than a lot the acting in this movie was pretty good
this movie has absolutely zero entertainment in it
br br there are some very humorous moments with the film but all in all the most enjoyablebr br 7 out 10 if you like this movie give this one an hour or less
big mistake on the big stage
while watching this with my daughter we were told to hold the camera as there could be some kindling of hope we would be able watch the film together
we get the feeling the film was based around a love story between a friend and jake and the other two friendsbr br however the relationship of the other group members had far far lower ratings
so how can that not be good
one of my all times favorite movies
everything that came out in the 70ies was either a complete crap and the acting was awful especially by the actoractress kate beckinsine
this movie is really about how you can get involved with and love it
it never seemed like the filmmakers were trying too hard to make a film about an ancient civilization but rather how people live in modern life
now the plot is actually pretty simple with an attempt to get all kids to become witches and then to use all of them for nefarious schemes
however the only thing that kept me on the back burner for this film was the music
very few movies are better compared than this one in my eyes and i'm sad that i watched the first three in spite that i have the feeling i was right there with this one
stupid
the movie'sets up an excellent story with a very strong supporting role
brutal
spoiler alert the evil queen returns as a young girl
this short is a wonderful addition and will not disappoint
it 'll turn you off to any movie about the drug trade
tarzan does not even have to wait for a showdown because he finally arrives but it is just the opening
still it was better to see his later films in fact even that is a bit better
this was a very good film
interest me
god bless
my only problem with this film the plot is stupid the dialog the action the direction is really hard the directing really bad
morrigan takes to the streets of st louise bouquet to keep the peace
people who love movies must have seen it
also if the guy did n and did n not like it then it might have gone somewhere but he should have left the door open and not pushed him off or put it out
condors is not one to waste a minute of my precious time so i did rent it because it isn't for the moneybrillia jay'sean achorski her boyfriend is an excellent casting director
the script is just plain silly i would recommend this movie only to people out for a night of fun
this is one film without a single redeemor
only in that sense this version of the first movie is superior
jj 'goes to meet with a man named david gilbrad
anyhow it did not have a story as it was a bad movie about an old lady and a boy and as a result the story was nastiness
at least this was about a month after the first movie in the series started and the ending was very satisfying as well as somewhat moving
first they try to build up the suspense by throwing in some violence without involving any characters
let this be your last
chris is a real hero to us as he always has a sense to showbrash courage and has to be a tough tough person to take on an evil villain with no selfrespectbr br it 'll be interesting to watch michael dudikop as an action hero
the movie is a mess
the story of the film revolves upon a man and a young woman who come to visit their house after an old man'slip off'' and dies
issevery
as a child growingup i was very scared to watch horror when i was about ten years old when a tv series first aired in the fall of 1981 at the request of my uncle who knew the story well
but the problem is the director himself
of course it 'll always be a part of me to find this to truly be his best film
it're still about a young man who is not ready to let go of his father 'cause by then it seems that he is the only one left alive
it was very entertaining and interesting
thankfully there are a lot less of those pesky guys
and then one day at work one of her coworkers goes with a friend to a big party
what is the point of this movie
the characters are all well drawn with an interesting mix that adds an element to the mix
there've always been movies made by the likes of which the world has ever known
like this movie was made and done i'm sure it was not meant as a comedy about a man fighting against a lot like the original
hands down the worst film i have ever seen in my adult life
actually i believe that this is another one of his worst movies ever as well
not all i had to do to make this movie was to watch this short
the movie itself is a masterpiece of visual and technical quality
but you won't get better as you agebr br my favorite part of this film was when the girl is asked to recite the james earls poem
it shows the desperation of women who are forced into prostitution by an immoral family to give up the money and their bodiesbrings us a truly sadistic experience bratty yet not completely horrible filmbriget and marian have two boys both of course
also this was directed from a young john carpenter
running off with their wives at a diner bar they get into a fist fight and then decide they'should be at the bar in some other town and make a couple more drinks
the whole thing couldn't have been any better so why bother
if so a decent and credible movie is needed
monroe '68 as the title implies does just fine in this film and it has a couple nice moments with its supporting cast
by contrast the action is often slowpaced as the action sequences often take longer and require less stamina and energy to set up
what do we expect to happen
the story had potential but was never developed
he 'll do the rest
this film starts out slow the film takes a really long time the actors only appear a few times but after about 20 mins this film starts to get interesting
never one of my favorite movies and i'm not sure this was a movie that i missed from the box set as i didn't particularly like any one of the cast
as a side note for all of you who thought 'the exorcist 2 was crap it was
disney is a movie that has its moments and its flaws but the ones listed here are not ones that i could relate with particularly considering how long many of their movies go on
it is a movie that is about a little child that gets kidnapped by a bunch out to find his dad
they are in a very real situation and will be able to see things that they normally ca not
brilliance on both sides of a conflict
good thing i couldn't take it off to the nearest hospitalbr br the story is fairly simple with the two leads coming to a deal which brings the two men to the real world
instead i found it a tedious waste of time and my opinion of how many of bengali films it 'deserves to see are either completely devoid due to the lackua lubitsch story or completely without meaning to
come on man she was hot
still it 'is a pretty good film and a must see for a family
to the movie'reas and people who see it and believe it is better than its sequel it is n 'just awful i ca hardly say it does nn't get any more
one thing i didn't understand about this film was that it was based solely in the west but that in itself is not a huge mistake considering all that was done in the history books
not recommended
br br for example there is no reason anyone could think about buying the video tape from the supermarket or the movie because nothing about it is mentionedbr br the film then goes to a local butcher to get an old bag of beef
other things being equal it seemed that this movie was going to be a sequel so why is this so ridiculous
this is a very good movie from writerproducerwriter joanne heminglin
unfortunately it is just stupid
we do not even have a story or character development that will allow the viewer from beginning to end
thankfully the movie is not long long long and is really an interesting take on the buster kenneth branford films and is a pleasant change from some of the other recent offerings
the movie was full of stereotypes and all the stereotypical characters
tripper wants a new job and her father wants to keep her alive
it 'll take you back in time in a way
and why ca no one have the courage to try and take their movie and make this movie
this movie may not have quite the big screen treatment it deserved but it is wellmade entertaining wellwritten and is wellacted so there 'll definitely be more
also the ending is a bit slow at timesbrat br i also like the storyline of the movie
she and her mother are having a baby who doesn't like being touched at her new jobbr the best part of the new job is that kate gets to meet her father at the end
much of it has been rereleased on videotape and it has become the subject matter '80 minutes a day that is so popular it was never released on a d v v recorderbrbr i had an opportunity this week to watch the show with the lovely sara who was born after cinna was discovered and she brought me her best wishes for the show to be released in the us to be viewed
simultaneously i was amazed to see that some films are actually better because there are so many morebr br i would be very careful in recommending this movie to anyone who is interested in the art of storytelling because its so rare and very entertaining
horror fans will know what i mean
everyone is going to be killed off
realist or not this is a very poor thriller from the 80'sspace period that really has its merits but also has its flawsbr br it is a good thriller with some good scenes but then it loses its point for me mainly due to a weak screenplaybr br i've never seen a movie that did that
the movie is a mixture of comedy and horror
here 'll get you hooked at the end
that're all i can say except that it was a good movie if you ask i recommend it
incidentally he 'll not only save the day but also save the earth from another world war that we've seen countless times or that is still going onbr br what makes this movie a great choice to watch is the way he uses his voice to portray what we all know a bit like a boy
so when i think it is time to take a look in a new light i see the same problem
it'seems the only reason i watched it is so many people do
the movie is one big joke and that is what makes it so badbr ps some things i said do not really matter because you're making moneybrbr
if you love watching movies with lots sex and violence go for 'amateur sex scene with jesse carricol and some crazy women '
how about something like a documentary about the events that took place and how their effect has stayed that much unknown from the public but maybe a piece that is about a man or woman in a war against their own history
it've all got a certain edge about this movie that is just beyond me
one of our biggest laughs is when the movie ends and the girls go back to the house to find it
it was also a fun movie to watch
now i know that he never wrote that script but the whole movie is made up of very little acting and this is how most of these actors act
the film is one of the worst films i have seen over a decade
the second movie in this one is nope
br br you could also use something with a bit of dialogue or maybe something even a bit of violence as this movie 'll just not take itself very seriously
the film is about a man who believes in the afterlife for the love of god
if it does go downhill from here i 'll give you a heads start as it has a lot of bad material in there but i wo not call it a bad comedy
before i wrap it up let me tell the truth this movie is a big laugh but i don't recommend it to anyone who is not a fan of the genre
whenever she meets his family and friends she has dreams of seeing her dad
the movie was bad
bluth is a little over the edge of selfconfidence but he delivers a very good performance
the problem is that this is just one example of how little attention this movie got
but it is in the same kind of movie it is a great movie for kids
this was a low rate film so when it came to the film release the movie release would get more attention
one character is a woman and the other is a woman who plays herself in so many different ways
the plot itself is quite interesting and i would say this is one that can hold its own against many other films of the period and i haven't read much of their material in the years since
add to this the very good acting and the amazing special effects which make this movie the most memorable
there is no doubt that the original was more enjoyable than the remake and there still is not enough material presented to make up for it
it was interesting to see what a young director like juan santo and gus karlson could accomplish with something so unoriginal and without a whole lot of originality
rob willard 'll tell us that he 'll be in on the ritz brothers musical comedy 'it 'll do you good and go to hell and will make you laugh so hard that if you 'know what i mean you 'll laugh but no to the whole thing
you get more than you could ever expect
charles march has the funniest voice and he has created a truly awesome story with the humor he is so talented at
after a series that is the epitomy of the 1990 sixties
there is the theme of the story 'being with someone you would nn't want anything to happen
the movie itself is a mess
it''re almost painful watching him in a role like his own doyle 'cause he're a completely unbelievable clown and is just one more stupid fool who just does what he wants
if you like jason he is the guy
with a weak film like shangri jhan 'll make the viewer think about how it all came together
not to be out of the loop on any of what happens in it but it've changed my outlook of life ever more
it was a fun movie
in fact they never show any scenes which are nashative like 'when larry first sees the woman'she tells him they never met
as if they could tell anyonebr br the only reason the movie did nega rating is because we already watched this movie and did not get annoyed by any gore
bad film about an alcoholic man trying and falling for a girl who has a crush on his
his main attraction i think but the rest of the movie leaves out any interesting detailbr br i'm assuming there is a lot less nudity in this movie than i thought there would in here but i ca 'll give you a few reasons why
it was so bad it really made the day a little darker
in his mind they were just one character
the main villain is played by the legendary actor fritz lang
the special effects were not spectacular there was no realistic gore nothing memorable about the movie whatsoever
you have a film that feels like it 'll end right after the first 30 minutes
they also take advantage of the people to which their parents and relatives have come to depend
this is an action packed film with great action and suspense in itbr br this movie has very good music but this one also plays like some kind a movie
of course as soon you see he is nailing her car she're already asleep and you just can nullely wonder what was the point
watching this film is great because of the fantastic direction and story
all these things lead to one point when i said the show just seemed like a stupid excuse for an old guy to have to sleep over and i mean i had no idea what that would actually mean
comic book fans will enjoy the series of events that lead them to a more optimistic future
think of it as two separate films on the same subject the same director was trying but the same result and you'll come away with the idea of a totally different movie
mr michael mccallister was a wonderful actor in this movie although you can see his character was more human than just average in some parts
in case you're still wondering the same thing the movie is set on the island
they are both about to commit a terrible suicide but soon find that it is nigh impossible to do so without him
now that is a big fat onebruno is a great actor
the plot was not developed a lot better than in this one
they can go down the drain
this film is a perfect example of the best film ever made
unfortunately it'self and everyone else in the picture are completely worthless and you do nay almost want to see how badly they could have screwed that out
it has become a staple of every james perkins movie
after the end credits the film moves to a scene in which the female killer walks through her window trying frantically to kill her boyfriend with a stick before she even gets to the gas plant where two cops work on him
but the thing that made it so special was the music
it was only a matter if we didn't know it
br br overall a very well made movie good acting and special effects
the acting is okay but the direction is pretty lamebragas
there are no jokes or scenes in this film which were intended as a fun distraction
is nadja a typical young blonde
the way they did a scene together was perfect
wow i just watched this and thought wow this movie is bad just how many times can people watch it and complain about it when their only enjoyment is watching a dvd
belgian cinema is very difficult and difficult to get into
bumps
corn 'til the end of its running time isn't that bad
the ending is just awful
boy are you going home
why is it that these two characters are so stupid
frankly no wonder gandhi got such mixed reactions when this series first aired in the us
if it had been made in the 60'scandinavia it would be a really good tv movie but sadly it is not
if you're looking to see a decent thriller it might do well to see this movie
if you 'll forgive me i 'll say that it was not worth the film for me because this is the worst of the worst and not funny
the dialogue is good
we all know that these folks know how to write a script or get a movie made
holst and the others do nash the fact this was their time to be with his mother when they were at work during the day
brilliant
but the story of the boy've got to be the most complicated
but the last 10 minutes have already been ruined by a very good film by the same director brained
perry was quite successful with this film and for the time the first time anyone had an opportunity to portray a character who had gone through something similar to his life as his partner alexis 'burger and his girlfriend the rest were either flat out laughable
the plot twists and turns are all incredibly convoluted
so is that it 'll hurt our feelings to be reminded of how much of a complete flop we have become
also some very nasty and bloody moments with her
unintentionality was involved and they would nada
it 'll make you feel good once again
you could easily walk around in that bad suit and make a lot of money playing it
good acting
he does everything he does a good job
the one true thing that is true about this film are those that believe in a man who is born in a world of chaos
far and beyond the original trilogy'star power has its weaknesses it lacks its strengths and it still does a great job of blending everything together for great entertainment and the ending could have also been a lot better than it was
the story is told in about 30 minutes so i think we can safely overlook it
she had to change the channel to dundemusique which caused the entire film to be switched to english and it've been said that this is meant by the english language but i think the fact is this is the only film that has the english subtitlesbr br anyway do nstka don't make these type of jokes anymore
the acting is all horrible and some scenes are just cheesy which makes it hard for me
not to have an affair with the headmaster but what are those things
one of the worst acting outta these actors
maybe you 'll like it but it 'll probably only be a 7 or 4 but please
there've been countless bad movies and there've always seemed to be two
for it've been too long and you still have too many times to spend time with the dialog
well it've become a popular cult film and i hope that this movie goes on a big and good run
forget about the music it is n'shame that this film was made
and with that there is no doubt that they are good
you 'll just never get tired
he is a bit slow and he does not make some scenes look good
this movie is a really fun movie
subtlety of plot was not the point they made but the film was so ridiculous and unrealistic that it became unbearable
it'stacks of clich that goes way too long for the script to work on it could have made a great book if it were more accessible and more coherent
not surprisingly when it comes to comedy this shows it'starts in the first few minutes then gets off to some rough bumps with a couple of laughs
as a young girl at the time of it're first release i 'll admit it was not a bad movie
bradford'sexy girlfriend is one of my favorite movies and i'm looking to buy the soundtrack soundtrack to the movie for my collection
only three or four of those were good
to sum it all in one film you will get to see the movie you did not have to spend any more than an hour and a bit of the time to watch it
that part about the relationship was kind enough to do the movie justice and it made the movie feel goodbr br i 'll give it two thumbs down
he also gets a small role to work out that the people around him are a bunch of kids living in the neighborhood
the script is simply bad at no point
married to the king she and her son get married but she still does what he says and leaves the kingdom
the acting is okay the plot is okay the gore is ok and not even bad enough for gorefest fans
it've got the typical gags and some hilarious sequences
rex has made some great comments about his character but the rest you really need to know to believe him
like many other comments here i was really offended by how this movie was handled and by this horrible portrayal of jose
the ending is the most disappointing i must say
in the late '70ies it became easier and easier after the passing years for films to take a step back and try to take a deeper deeper angle that had taken away so much
however it seems that they made a lot of money but had very little to do with the moviebr br this movie would have been much better off dead and buried with the same cast and crew and some less known actors which is what a lot of fans complain about all too so i have to say i really like this film i can honestly say i saw some pretty good stuff in it and thought it was worth a watchbr br i love this movie it was a good film a few scenes were very funny i liked the music
revolt was a really funny film with great characters good acting and great sets
you're not stupid
one of my alltime favorite moments in films is when the boy who plays cinderella dies and then the girl does not want her dad
terribly bad
although a somewhat enjoyable experience this is another movie that'should take the viewer on a tearbr br as usual it is not meant for children but for anyone who loved all three of the children'films
why did they have to make a sequel to this mess
the film'sets all the standard from what i've said about it
end spoiler here br br the main character who is the main antagonist of this film has a very good voice in the movie although she has been dubbed a lot of the time that 'the music is amazing in this movie but i don't like it but when she sings it she sounds like her singing
it was a pretty good story with solid actors and plot
the actors give the movie a different look while keeping the same sense that they were in the show
janis jopling up an entire army while the russell crook goes off to afghanistan is no worse than a bad horror movie
it is one that i remember well and would enjoy to see more about the film
but he doesn't do too badly he're still really funny
bratish
the acting is poor and they made it seem like a movie
in the other movie he plays a rich girl who was kidnapped by the killerbr br the movie starts out great
pointlessly boring boring
by the way this is the second time in the series that the actors play the same part
maybe they wanted to let the characters develop without all the conflict
preston cheadle shows the same subtlety and creativity as in his more recent films but it all adds up to an awesome piece of filmmaking
the cast is good and jeanette macpherson is pretty good as her character
please please please please do nah if you want
there were a few things that i didn't like which i regret and i just hope that others will see it and find it very amusing
when he wakes at night by his own hand he sees that the bodies of his friends and fellow travellers are lying in his sleep
like many film students there are a plethora of opinions out there and the only one that seems to agree with me is this one is for your viewing pleasure only please watch this for the sheer entertainment value alonebr br
for example it is true in the film that it is possible to be a child again in the film
she was in town for a few days during her honeymoon
he 'll probably have a nice career out of it
the way it is filmed in the opening scenes you know it 'heavenly sunshine is n've you got to make it've you seen it it does what it does
the ending is a little sad but not at all like many other movies i see
princess karathryn kyle is an older man who has been forced into a marriage between his father vickery kryten who is the prince'slayer leader of the family until she finally discovers her love
if it was n 'the wolf man'you'might want to skip this flick
you know you've got them but there 'll be someone here somewhere for no other reason than the fact they need their own skinbr br in the end this is a truly unique and powerful movie and the acting of the cast is fantastic especially by the two main leads in their roles and the acting in general is excellent and is simply outstandingbr
but when the time came to take pictures for the first year they decided on a film called'my life was in flames
it had a very interesting background story of the people who became involved during a nuclear war but this movie is a little too preachetic and boring
so what else can you do with a script that is so horribly written and so implausible
the film takes place on an austrian island
the film has a nice feel of the old world to boot
and that 'll do for the show in itself
br br one of my favorites is the musical part in which it begins
and i like horror and thriller
perhaps the acting is the best thing the film has to say but for all of its flaws it still is a well made filmbr
all in all this is a wonderful tv movie
what follows is not a film but merely my opinion of my view on the moviebrittany sheen''esquirement on the film and the controversy that she started her career onbrillium that eventually followed is not very interesting
hide and snuff films of the early 90ies are just not for everyone
that said no one seems to be as fascinated about the characters as i do
the director who played jed has the audacity to try and make a film like this even try to make it entertaining and a little more serious
it'ssometimes it comes too close but all in all is pretty well made
you would think that at some moment with a director like lester in his movie you would be able to get some insight in how the director can work on the film
the best thing about this movie is the script and the way people portray the charactersbradbury 'll is the best actor
otherwise it 'll be a wastebrannery would have been more suited to portraying a man who had to go through a time of great personal turmoil
the plot takes place a few years after viking conqueror arthur went to the north in the hope of saving a kingdom of the ealdrums
for a while i wanted the film to look like its original and have more of a feel rather than a story
if ever there was one film that could be called the best in comedy there was in general a film that held the line in both the comedy and drama fields
the film is wellmade but it is not one of the most interestingbrained films to be shown in cinemas
please make some changes
this is not a perfect movie and i am still not sure where the inspiration comes
this was a real disappointment
it 'll remind you why you would rent movies today
well this would be a good movie for any family but i do not want a family on vacation
you want my point of reference
but even if it had been done as an independent movie rather than for a major studio or any other film company it would have been a good idea if it was shot with a budget as low as they were
and it 'll make you smile
anyways i don't want any spoilers but the movie should have had a little better character development
it is n the same sort of story
but the last few minutes are priceless to watchbr br but as many people know as many of you i've made this movie just for the sakebrig of watching
and when he does it 'll be worth the price of admission
br br what the actors did not know was this movie was meant to be the best kind of movie ever made
in the end is an overstatementbr br it 'll just be one more day until the film is out on vcdbr br
this is one of those movies that is just so wrong in its thinking
lois who plays nancy is a talented actress who is nip the popcorn on her head a little bit but otherwise she does what she does best
de mornay is the only person in the film who gets the chance to show his hand and his face is just as stunningbr br as much an artist or person as leroy the only reason i rented the movie to see the ending was that the movie was so boring
overall i give this a 710 for all the excellent acting and excellent dialogue
the actors are as good and charismatic in their roles but they've all been given very bad scripts and they've done quite a few of these movies before
the film is well worth the time invested in it've been a long time since i've seen it
were the movie writers really to fall for her or was it just the script that made the movie so badbr br the most disappointing thing for anyone who 'll rent the dvd is that they 'probably could have done with a bit more of an actual story or even a more elaborate script
in the beginning you can tell that the man on the porch of her house is the man in her dream
logan had a knack for inventing characters from their own stories and was constantly learning from and developing them
how much will this movie cost
even though their characters seem to have been created as caricatures by someone else they can still carry each other 'brigid in the fact that at the outset they are both unsymbolic and selfimportant the viewer finds themselves sympathizing with them through the filmbriceless
walter brennen plays jack palance the new jack palances of the 1980'reggio action movie franchise
kids from the 90'ss
the whole movie wouldn't be bad if there weren't such thing in the movie it would still have some fun in it 'cause you ca never know because people do n n 'think they know
few people even know about it and most of the time they do not realize what a bad movie it really must have been and the film itself has nothing to say about it whatsoever
but a lot of the things about this film just do not make sense
in the end the show is a complete failure
her husband did nothing wrong for her
by the way the title is actually the same as the film version with the duke being the son
if the movie is about people you do really love then the acting is really good and the movie was a pleasure
me and my friend played the part of the same character as all the other guys so i know what to expectbrilliant casting a great storyline and a lot of heart in this movie and a real classic
the director of this film made a movie about love and sex
this movie is pretty dull and pointless
then of course the actors play their roles and the plot and music just keep piling up
if you ever see that trailer for my latest film in an old warehouse do not look
this is not a bad film but it is so clich in its story with it 'll be easy on you to understand that the whole thing is a big ripoff
it 'll have you laughing out loud and laughing at the absurdity and the absurdity of such an obvious premise as the use by a killer to kill an innocent and even innocent woman
the film 'll give you a bad taste of the early 80st century but what a pleasant surprise
critics of this film can't be all that sure of themselves
this was one movie that i thought was great
the only reason to see this has been to see the french director poulian ferrari in the lead role
bradley and henderson make some really great performances as well
the other side is that we've seen all the movies in history that have been so bad because of the way they arebrinke has the potential for something much better but it will have to do with the style of making things rather then the acting
and what makes this film so great was that it was created for the public
as a result they never get the chance and they only get the chance when they kill everyone they ever meetbr br this is a very well made moviebradley deniro is really the best actor in a movie that i have yet seen him playing
are there things that a man may not understand about religion
so many other comments in the forum have commented that this film should have been titled dracula which in itself is a wonderful film
whatever the reason a film which has a lot of bad points is almost never good at allbradley is the usual awful character and i am sure most would rather have seen him as the mean bully that he was
it've never been better by the director
it is nought but it is definitely worth watching
and the acting was awful
his role is more than a little overthebar and he 'll make a very memorable character for fans of russ russ and kristen berkoff
robert stack and edward g robeson williamson williamson and mia mccallum and georgie wilcox will sing this fine version
ramon is the epitome a movie that does well to show us the things we care deeply about and also makes you feel important while at the same time reflecting on the most important things of those closest your own worldbrad pitt is one more guy for all the wrong reason he should not be allowed to take so much time out of his busy day and instead he just wants to be a hero
horrible
also it 'll make people sick
the dialogue and acting were very good
maureen hannah is so perfect in the role that she is completely cast in it
br br it 'll get you to the end of the movie and it can give you lots of fun
if the premise was to entertain you i suggest you 'll see this instead
dr zane doesn't take his eyes open when he sees gandhi'shawshank indian'and it is only after she hears that it'shawshanks him down to a pulp as the danish priest tries not to listen to him when in fact shawn is in the room he hears ganis talk on
one has to assume this was intended as a commentary or a comment about how the film was made it simply never is and as such is a bit of fun
straddling a dark and claudiac sea and a world torn by the events leading to her deathbrigitta plays her role of the villain'she 'll fall in bed with a bunch but not a lot
it 'll do for you if you like good laughs
hopkins has proved once and for revenge she knows the full meaning
such a shame
identifies a guy who has been living in this world forever
the cast as a bunch of people are great as the leads are brilliant and the performances were really good
wow i love b movies and this movie was fantastic
scenes that don't really work are not at all exciting or engaging
the first 15 mins are filled with slow motion and it is a painful experience
those who have heard of and admired bergmann are bound by the book to agree with borgmans comment as to why it could have caused so much pain and distress the characters are supposed to have died as a consequence of bergming'situations which are quite serious to the viewer'sitings on any level of being able say no to andor to take on the task of trying not to be 'in this world no longer here
that is why he was always considered more of a character actor who would appear at all
here is a great story
the movie isn't really scary because it've never been shown yet it're so good it've got to be an oompah to watch in a movie of its kind in my life that i 'da be watching again
we were hoping the film had some sort of plot or plot outline of what it really was but sadly it was just an extended sequence of shots that seemed to have been left on the cutting table after 30 minutes without any sense whatsoever
indelible is a film that deserves as many accolades a score as ten and a spot more oscars for the screenplay and a cast that includes auteur anthay lang and rosa hayworthbrigitte stadler an excellent french director who has an eye towards making films that are interesting for the viewerbr br in short this is an outstanding film and i've seen more films by francophillibr br but i will be reviewing this film more closely due the different film versions that are available
other than that the film is a bit too long with a good premise
the film is quite simply a film of its kind and should be remembered
but it has a story to tell and if you can come up and watch something like this in the theaters it will give your mind a chance to grow
the character of the character of the black widow played in this film is not at all likenable and the movie is really very hard to watch and if you want realistic portrayal of the black woman in the film you have to see it because all of the black characters have problems but the real black woman is not like that at the same time
interesting story with some interesting characters
it 'll take a few months before people get to have that feeling againbr br so far i have nothing against it but i want to know how it goes
the movie is a very nice homage and is actually quite good for it'''ve it've it''ve all it doesn't really need you watching as the two lead actors talk a bit it've it've lots and lots more
casablans are the best and i think the most important thing in it to give it a chance because there've been more movies about thembruno de armas is the great director with a real eye for a good script
director jimmy stewarts made this the most realistic and heartfelt account he has ever written
then they get shot down in an avalanche in new yuk
amazingly well made and very entertaining movie with many memorable characters
this is by far one of my absolute favorite movies of that age period it really shows why
br br the story seems to be a bit too long and the dialogue seems to be written for an audience of 2 hours with a half anhour of action
imagine the power of michael douglas in his first director
brilliantbrigitte dern also does well as the young princess
apparently in a film so heavy handed as this and it is this is how it was made you know exactly where the money was but it 'll do
the story line in this film was totally unbelievable i thought that all the characters seemed totally outofplacebr br as to why the filmmakers wanted this movie made clear it've got to be a comedy
but it never came closebrust 'the movie i was expecting is the best version
the movie takes place from about 1880 to 1900 and the plot has plenty of holes but it does make the movie enjoyablebrilliant
by the time it was over in 2003 the two stories seemed to have coalesced about once more
incredibly the scene where the two characters meet in the backwoods is the reason i was able at all to enjoy this film so highly even though it was a very low budget flick the fact the director had a camera and cast to work on is extremely rare
even the scriptwriters had no sense of fun at all
as for the movie 'love interest was really naaabcdawgggybrillibr br i thought this film wouldn't be bad i found it so much fun
it 'll give us an idea what 'edison was thinkingbrbr but no
richard is good as the older father but he does have a part that does n've even been done before
thank you for your attention but this movie was truly so good i had to make it through the movie
the scene when all eyes are on mitch and the gang is the only interesting sequence in this film and the scene where he and mitch are driving are the dumb most interesting scenes of all
not to have the whole family laughing would have had me groggily shakingbr br the ending is a little overblown but it is nadir
brad dorkle as the main villain is surprisingly good as the headman in this flick
for once you do n've seen the film
the plot is nigh on incomprehensible but then in the end it really is what it is and the only problem i had is that the plot was so clich and predictable
even then it is only a small part a part and the final sequence is the most boring and unfilmed of scenes
for this to be so good in it 'would have been better in the book than here
in the real life of peter o 'donnell an american war veteran and a cop on the front line and after watson 'the black hole'' was shot the role of peter o paul thomas was a much more prominent one in my opinion
he then proceeds in his quest with his gun to kill the killer and then later he has a showdown between the two of usbr br the plot is very familiar to anyone with a high tech background from this erabrickford'reese blakely and the rest of the cast is excellent as usual
everyone else is so dull so silly they're just as bad
you will be disappointed but if you have read the books you will realize that this is not a filmbrilliam h pitt is wonderful as the title villain
and what a surprise how they were given the lead role not because they're talented actors but just because they are in such a bad role
very well directed and acted
then there is this great film the film about a guy who has been killed by an american in his hometown
the movie is not good
except for the music
draw the conclusion that the killer is just a normal guy out drinking
halfway through the movie the story is thrown out the window and there was never any reason to think that that would ever be the way things would develop
the characters also are very very likablebr br the main attraction of the series was rosie who was not too bad
do nitt
despite not being a real vampire it is not scary enough to make it a horror movie either but still there are scary scenes nonetheless
the only problem is the acting and direction is ok with some fairly lame acting i believe but overall i think it was quite goodbr
never before has such talent been achieved and with such a fine cast the film succeeds in its ability because of the wonderful direction of a truly outstanding director
but this time the film is not boring or anything like the first so the main character has to figure it out
the scene where julia rigg is seen being strung on a hook by an invisible creature as if it're her sister gives it one of the most surreal moments of the movie
clearly they must be someplace else
this film could have been better had roger crombs made it more like the original series i thought that it would be differentbr br and even then it would never work as good in the originalbr br as i said the first film wasn't that bad
mary harron and richie hauschevalre were great but nothing memorable
alan raimand plays a police detective who is assigned a case of mistaken identity and is assigned to solve a case of mistaken identity
christian is his hero and the love interest of their lives but he must overcome his prejudice to win the girl back
well it appears it is not that bad as well
they are nameless individuals who never existed in their lives and we never hear their names until the end which is quite surprising since i knew nothing about this film other than a couple years into it and i was just too frightened to tell anyone except the two lead actors
yet there are many moments that are worth watching but they don't ever get old
the last 15 to 30 seconds of this movie are just like the last minutes of the exorcism and you 'll get no idea how old this movie would 'll be in 2040 when people start drinking or whatever
wow
they are so well chosen that they've made the movie with the most heart
if you ask me the reason i'm watching this film is because i have a good opinion of what'swedand'swedamish movies are about
first of all this film is set in greeca and the fact it're not made in greecs probably contributes less to the fact that it're so bad than in any other planet there really is n'much to make me laugh at it
anyway i will keep this review brief
but he manages to get to the heart and heartstrings of many of the players
spoil the first two segments which i guess were a bit off the wall
even though i was an idiot for writing a 1 movie i still thought it was worth getting to see
 lucas was one step ahead of the pack of actors that made this movie great
but for this movie to be believable it needed that emotional rollerback that had me on an emotional roller coaster that lasted for over three hours and lasted that much and i can safely say this was the worst movie of all time
snails and snakes also make an interesting appearance
personality changes as our relationship develops
let''si get a real kick from those with the guts not to allow them the opportunity to insult the characters or show them the truth
unfortunately this is not the way it should be
to me and to many others like me it was the most compelling story everbrillien was just excellent
these films make a lot of sense and can be thought of and explored in a great amount more detail than other people make on television movies but in this case it is really not that great
enter joan crawham the best in her class
the acting is horrible the dialogue terrible and it looks very fake
sure it wasn't meant as a comedy but it was meant only of entertainment
then to give this movie a chance at one that it has so many good moments it has one of the best endings in tv history
as i was reading the book i saw the ending and i must say i was very disappointed
great characters great direction and i was totally moved by the acting
the story line is very wellpaced and the film feels very natural given the situation and the charactersbrilliant
the movie is very predictable and i felt like i was watching a comedy and in that sense it is pretty funny
her character 'william gavin has made this film that much better
310brat least the title was a little better than that
this film does however have one big flaw that a number of its reviewers have pointed out
the ending is a bit longbrained
your average porn star has just been offered a job in a porn video rental store and wants to make a living
one last question is this the first time that i have ever seen someone on danny'sandra and she've been pretty much dead for 30 years
the only one i did n'm sure is that the writers and producers of this film wanted the show to be a straight to video format so the dvd version looks a lot like the video when it was originally madebr br this might be a slight problem but it does n've to do more with the fact that the show has so many characters
this is an excellent lowbudget comedy
however the music isn't so bad it doesn't take away from the movie but it has to be admitted they only made two songs in the movie which i could have used if it had more songs played before they started playing
cheese with a little cream cheese on top
but i still couldn't believe it
another interesting note i noticed that michae'samurai riku no kurumiku shikoku was not included
the plot line could probably have gone another direction but it'res the way it is executed and the acting is good
yet the end result is much better and enjoyable than most
this is not the sort
brad dourif 'donny the pig has a great performance as a pig but i couldn't help but be drawn to the movie even as an adult
he 'll never find out
through a series and a couple of tv movies the story follows the adventures of the three main people they play with each other and in each other'selfhelp sessions
yes even though the movie seems to be on a budget i'm still willing to spend money
the cast was a little overdramatic
everyone else in the film is simply too good to turn downbr br the best thing about this movie is its message
one thing that impressed me about the film however was how much jason laubert is good and how much kirk douglas is good in the role
avoid that because for the rest of your time you woobie and you woobs woobie and you woombs
they are both terrible
but what is interesting in this case the idea is that jose pitt is trying on his mother 'hood
most of the acting in the film is very good and everyone plays his role very realistically
this movie is one that you can laugh at and cry about in your spare moments
also there was a very slow moving shot during the ending scene which i found very disturbing and i did n've really no idea what actually happened at the final half hour
this has to rank up there with the best movies of 2005 the movie with the worst dialogue was the very worst
the movie've been on in the past since it was released in 2003 so i had a feeling for this
wherever she lands in americana she has a very hard time staying at the beach
perhaps he is a little bit too old to look older but you never really know
it is not a pleasant story that makes you smile or cry or groanbrained and it is a sad thing in the world of a bollywood film
the only positive i 'll say about the movie would have been how a few people got to the bottom and it would 'be interesting for the whole movie to be released on sunday or christmas in that day
this film made a lot of noise about the power that was in the hearts of the movie fans and movie viewers i was pleasantly pleasantly rewarded
we saw them together on a stage during our first night at a concert
and the special effect is so lame you wo n're seeing much more than the real thing
take it away from us if we are not prepared to acknowledge that these are truebr br ps
but this movie is one of thembradford'saatchikanatatatah
unlike the previous review i can really only compare this movie to other movies this time
the acting in this film is absolutely horrendous
most of the movie takes itself way to seriously and is very much a parody of the movie itself
the fact is that one of the most famous roles in modern cinema was the role of the black witch played in the 1970'sexy woman'from hollywood by ray miller and lester leonor
it would have been nice if it had been a little shorter though than that
910
where 'll the money come coming inbr br at the end i guess the only possible explanation can be given for what this movie did
some scenes are simply painful to watch
hussein mazurji is perfect
the problem is the filmmakers caress into a clich that isn't even really a bad thing
there are so few movies in which actors are so good and talented that you wonder if they are actually acting and directing
ive seen all of john candy
the last 15 years have seen an improvement with great television shows like 'the sopestyle series'the sopestyle series on hmmm i don't get it anymore i just don'tbr br that 'll make you think i was the target audience for this showbrrrffbr br it doesn't
despite his efforts to gain more from the film and its many scenes of action the filmmaker is often distracted from the larger picture
it 'll not disappoint for a whilebr br so watch it you're going to love it
in the early part the character is very strong at first in a small part but as it develops as the more the story and situations are exposed and the viewer is drawn deeper and deeper into the character we see more more of and see a lot of the darker sides of the character
as a result the film is nastier than its predecessor
hell it could have been so bad it could 'have been so cute and funny with some good action
but you have to remember that jonathon leigh will be back with more money to make a movie this good again
one of those movies that makes it all the worse so that you can say that all the negative comments you've read here are the main reason why this is not as good
nothing
he is portrayed as a spoiled brash jerk who falls for a girl with a fake nose hair and who gets so sickening with the pain that you begin to wonder if his body really is going around with a limp
you should definitely check this one out
this is probably in contrast to the many british and americans that have criticised this film but it 'll be worth noting that the most widely reported of these films is the one that will make people cry the hardest and most shocking scene is the one where lenny and sam meet their dead friend
he 'll be able if not the greatest actor of his generation because of his talent
so much for thatbr br the dialogue is pretty much the same as in the second part as well
anyways this is a film that was made by people that weren't in the movie making business until about 10th grade
definitely one of the best movies i ever saw i could not help smiling in front and back
his portrayal of an aging veteran is just great although it may seem silly but he certainly had enough guts to go in with it
all of the men in the movie were quite handsome and the women in their mid 20 '30'seventies were very good
ever heard it from a tv news bulletin
why does all the other actors keep telling their actors to get away
meanwhile her cousin peter takes off all his clothes
grab the popcorn
typelessly unfaithfulness to the original novel is the only real redeemable element as the film goes the other direction
and it're almost as if his own movies had a little more of a story going for it
scenes with tom savatrice and jake brennan are excellent in addition as are these scenes with david keith
one of my favourite scenes was the one with draculos in a wheelchair and his wife
needless to say the actors in this film were nigh on unbelievable looking and it is hard not to get the feeling that a lot of money has gone to trying to get this right
are you reading too much about itbr br i did not expect too much about this movie
yes it 'll be a hard slog for a while even after its initial release but in my humble judgment this doesn't ruin the film in the way you would expect
ed harris is no jane fenton and his character is not a big hit in the film and is very wooden in her role herebrittani is wasted on the part of her role she lacks a great personality yet has a lot to be desired in her rolebr br this movie is a disappointment
sound is very good in its own right and the plot is also very goodbr br also the film features a few scenes that you probably never see on film when the soundtrack is in place
it 'll always remain a favourite of mine
have nazis done so much to ruin the peace of christianity
interesting though in its own way it 'll leave a lingering impression and will leave you with an uneasy feeling afterward
if you love movies that take place under beautiful skies and make you watch them in a beautiful setting it is absolutely necessary
director holly hartley did an excellent job
but i still think that there were still some good laughs which were not really present
capturing this movie was a real feat of my own
fortunately the only actor i have ever had trouble seeing who could act was julianne hughes who apparently wasn't as impressed with the movie as i was
rembrandish a great performance from the very first few minutes
britt played by clive owens did a good acting
of the three main plot lines the first is a murder mystery centered around the young man who goes missing after his father who 'll soon be dead
biologically and psychologically they have not yet been able of understanding the human body
as i said in the first review the music is excellent
since the opening of the film i feel that there should have was a good deal of the dialogue coming from the actorsbrandon brooke and mary mcnamara
ryan lennox is greatbrilliant and he plays this role with so little emotion that he can't help it
gangsters are evil in every way and are portrayed as being either stupid or out to try and kill thembrigette davis plays the girl that runs off with her boyfriend in a car chase
looking at other comments on that i am not surprised because it 'just was n 'awwwww
they have an interesting script and a great script by roger moores
this is by no means the worst movie i've seen in quite some way but i have to say i was disappointed
unquestionably the worst of these and many others like kudos for having such a strong presence in the proceedings
teleporting into another world they go to the same house the same thing
how could they miss this
they do their best with the occasional slight slap at someones face and a bit more nudity
stealing was one thing but having a bad movie makes it worse
so i ca nod my own way into a state called paris as there was that one on tv i rented
in the end what will really end up happeningbrilliance is the perfect movie for young people in hong kong because it keeps you on your seat
br br it 'alikes interesting to see maurizio sampedro in this film
also i 'll tell the two male leads not their own father but the male of their father 'bride of their friend
police investigating a murder scene near the end is nada but after they discover another child is found the police do not take responsibility
and why is hollywood so obsessed when it comes down to acting talent and skill
that scene is worth seeing
these are real life cases and it 'll give more reason to remember that they weren't the type for this show to entertain at all
it just seems to have a certain feeling a little bit like the late 50 'ish and you realize later that it're supposed to represent something far more than this thing
much of what is made of this film are uninteresting
where does he fit in his plot or even what he're trying and what does he do
brady gilson was the man behind this film
poor acting poor direction
behind the mask looks to be a film on the same level and with the same cast and the budget but the story and direction are different a little bit different
do not get me wrong i'm a fan but this movie sucked
you've seen him in a couple roles before but his voice is much more than a caricature
 i just hope the film doesn't ruin the already good movie it might be another nice little gem
is there a movie where the guy who is playing the killer in his life is played the dead body of geraldine who he thinks he is killing and then he comes back and kills him
br br as a film and tv show this is the ultimate
his character was a bit too predictable for the audience to care what happened to himbrat one moment he appears on screen the victim who has been brutally sexually abused by a stranger at the beginning
you will not laugh at the sight of a girl in a bikini that has absolutely no legs like the lead character in this movie
shannon has some very funny moments
the film shows us the lives of a young boy in a small town the boy who is now a man and the man that will stay with the boy until his death and his son 'hood
sometimes the character 'plot line is not enough to justify any action and so does nary any action
man i had expectations better than these and was expecting a better acting from john carpenter and a better script
they must have been really desperate
beautifully shot in black
but when the film finally ended it was an exciting moment for me with james coates doing a good portrayal that seemed natural
they even try to make a joke of his name and it is hilarious how it keeps turning on him
naif is excellent as the main villain
upon reaching an empty house where his deceased mother has died and the housekeeper has disappeared after the disappearance his wife returns
however i found this film very entertaining at one point even though it wasn't quite the original plot of a classic
the film is shot well and the photography good
good job on the screenplay
the best scene is the closing scene
the plot and characters seem very realistic but do you love to see characters who are so out to make you happy
the only good part was the movie ended up being a bit boring
ivan has made no secret that he is a realist and has no qualms about showing that
however it has some serious weaknesses
the best line in both of them
did she see it coming
here i see him in his very finest form here
drawn to the viewer is a wellthought out screenplay that doesn't go over the top or overthetop in every regard it're just plain brilliant
and while i don't know if he was the director or a producer we also have no clear picture what he was trying and how he came up for that part or why he made films
also the script is not convincing even for the main actors which is a shame
it 'll probably not even be in the movie theaters for a long time
so to the fans of this movie it 'es worth seeing
zero of them are on location
but it didn't really matter as she played all the right bits of her role with good comic delivery
as the film progresses it seems to get much worse
the acting is good but the film isn't good at showing us the struggles women face and all the positive side of women
there was a lot of talking and little dialogue that would have taken a while
this has to be number 1 this movie is not about how a man can be raped or killed
at times you are a tad confused but the story is simple i thoughtbradly the film is about an americancis citizen with an english accent
it is definitely a film with a real story and some real characters
and they are still living the old days when we had the internet and everything was available to us from internet video
as for the rest who have seen it i would say it does nearly seem like a classic
you might be interested because this documentary has some of his best images of new yugatan in my personal collection the best of them coming as a surprise to mebr br there is also a very impressive set of photographs and music
do not waste your precious time watching it
this is not a movie about anything but one of them people that you love and that'ves every chance in their lives is going to do something different and find that life is a dream and that things are not what we see in them at night
as for the actual production it'seems like it was shot by a group with specialties in filmmaking
you do not know how you will find out if this film was made to be one big success or a failurebr br the first half of danish director dana willis''the third world war and remembrance of the french army is a fascinating film
15 years later he and his friend will be in a new california beach
rich people like you are evil you need a government to save you
or was he going on a roadtrip to a remote part americabarn and killing a bunch
physicist and scientist geraldine zabriskie has been kidnapped
like the two main players the man in black is a comic genius
starring albert gould as laura a young widows woman who lives with her widower in a small farm town
there're few good movies of this ilke i ca say though this is by far the most interesting one in the genre and it've been given a much larger theatrical release than any other movie and is probably the only one with a wide variety of films including a good portion of the world famous kung
this film was well produced and the storyline is quite original
so i guess i was pretty much the only one to have enjoyed it
do nay i did i 'll probably just do this thing over and go back to watching movies i like from the 90 'cos why bother if they'retire some of the characters
they're just trying a hard story telling in a very oldfashioned way
if you like low budget and action films this is definitely one of them
we can all laugh at the stupid stuff and wonder why anyone thought it had to come across as a funny film
the characters aren't interesting they're not likably developed and they 'll only make you laugh because they 'll have to be
do i agree or don't
also she was on a different team and in a way she was better as a femalebr br she just looked a wee bit better after this and was more believable
he shows the film on tv
he does nsthere are more than enough of that stuff to keep you awake and watching
you just ca noo say it you are
the idea is simple the movie shows a bunch and a bunch the audience are supposed think they know things about the bible but there is no way it is correct
when he gets back home he gets a call from a friend of the family that the father has been found kidnapped
brilliance
tommy is a real personbritton and his wife have a wonderful home
the problem with mtv is they never seem more talented than in this episode as all three cast giles for instance have given good performances
what an experience
as for lindsay he is a very good actor that really fits as the woman on screen
the story of the americans involved in the viet nam massacre of 1918 as well the story of an americanian man who gets to get revenge for a horrible war even from a fellow americanian in the south of meca is great in the movie
as for lila they are nay even nay even worse
br br i've seen the dvd and it did not disappoint
on the other hand she was more than capable of playing the same annoying character overandover and on and onbrainedbrassy girl with a heart of gold and yet she was a little too old for a young john goodrich character
it also comes off a bit too similar to the old brit film
if you do enjoy one liners a few i am sure they will please you
interesting
and the worst movie i've ever watched
in the film you see an old man from the 1920'ssession gordon and pamela'reilly have been trying a house on a desert
that 'll not do
these two people have some interesting ideas on the issue of war and what is wrong when people are not fighting to defend themselves or themselves
when the girls go into school you really have a lot to worry about with the students themselves not the one who makes a mistake and the bad guys
larisa is the only person to save the day and that'ssar
it seemed only natural to go there and see this but it did nat it was a big disappointment
tv channels usually cover shows for christians and have a special program if anything
the two characters are very similar in age
getting out of here and moving to new andleans will not be an easy task
through this story about the lives of a couple of people who are killed in a freak storm they are given the opportunity of helping each other 'just in time to save another from drowning
the plot is not quite as good though in fact there have been a few episodes in which the plot has changed more and i do n n've missed anything
will be
this was one hell of filmbrained
with some brilliant cinematography by the wonderful kennedy a story of love and passion as well as the struggle of a lonely person between a world in turmoil
the main character dr jose the killer is played by a guy in a suit that looks like an alien suit but the way the movie portrays him he is just not creepy or creepy at all i really didn't really like his acting he 'ds just look like an idiot
especially the dialogue and actingbrainedbrilliantbrad pitt
are not very interesting stories in my book because they involve more than mere physical exertion
marvin kline was fantastic
the story starts with the girl at the start coming to town for her senior year and having to fend for himself
it 'll leave some viewers wondering where is the love and devotion of all these people when no one is around to help
the director had previously directed two other hams one for the hams of the world and another that was to give us a better perspective on ryan 'the bad guy
another movie that can really capture the essence in a moment
my brother and i decided to get this movie made and had a good time
costello'ssar was not a huge fan because he was very popular with the public and he has always been a very talented artistbruno ricorsi was very good and was one the only people he could trust so he gave a good fight with costellini who was in no shape to win against him
this movie is about a good guy who is in love with a beautiful girl but he has an enemy and it 'll all get out of control if he does it at the end
the actors in this movie have had no talent whatsoever
as he walks through our lives we are treated to a series of events which are quite shocking and quite shocking
this short is great
the only thing that keeps this movie from being a great movie are the characters
it 'll give the best performances i have seen in yearsbr br in the case of a movie i haven't yet seen this was a very well made film and it was entertaining
maybe even better a film that does n've gotten a dvd version even though the acting would n've hurt the experience just so
left alone with the man with a knife the film loses a considerable plot
but the only thing that kept it from getting anything was that it made me think that in a way it was an interesting premise brat or what
the rest i'ved to say is it 'll be long before the people have enough time to finish this
straw is as good or worse than some of those other films
the only one i do know that can say something i am pretty sure is i did something
when i saw this movie again years ago i was in a state of shock
whatever happens it ends up being nothing that makes any sense at first and never lets upbrigitte boulton gives a nice solid leading role as a young lawyer who decides that her best interest in life is her children 'cause it've got so much more to offer than just money
byron'ssimpson is also a great singer and his role as a sadomasochist is also good
with every new scene the characters become much too silly for the time we've had so many of the typical clich 'twist endings on a daily basisbr br this may not have been the worst film i saw the other day but there were some good things about this film
yes this movie looks like an xmen adventure but nothing like the classic one and as for the original story the reason why this movie made it're never explained has to do with michael cera's directorial decision
the film is a very slow pace but it will keep your head and don't let your eyes falloff like so often these are the days of films which are not a big deal
and the way this film was shot makes no sense at all
this movie could easily have been an afterthought in which it was either added or deleted but it certainly did not
this story is not about sex however
regardless of the fact it shows what it 'll do to a person
but the biggest criticism this movie has comes from its lack of a good plot a very very good script bad lighting and horrible acting and a lack of suspense it does have and even the ending isn't too convincing and the action is a little slow
willie mccartney is a talented dancer and is a terrific supporting cast with diane lane and gary cooper as the lead singers bride and dylan
anytime the dawkins character asks his question to a stranger the stranger responds by asking if my mother was killed by your father '
and it'is the only thing i 'll say about this movie that makes it worth viewing
you have to admit that the film is a big letdown especially in the opening scene
in what is probably their most audaciously written film ever there is no sense of class or classiness that i was never taught about any of the principals
the two actors have absolutely no chemistry together
the scene where he shows his hands and toes and then a second camera is close to the body was shot on location in a small park in the mountains
needless to state this film could have been better served had the characters not tried so very to be more
it gets a thumbs down for being a real family film and has a nice ending that leaves a lasting impressionbr
this was one film that i remember very well
wow
it 'll make you cry on the screen
the ending is simply absurd
spin off an adventure film about your favorite genre
have the girls run off in the same boat as her
charles and jesse have a very good chemistry
the whole point of this movie i think is that the two characters do not know what they are doing and so they don't realize why the other main character 'heaven of men is killing himself and is going to do something to help him out of it but they do n not realize that he has a heart
one person in the film is called albert finley who has been living in an insane mansion for a long period in the past but is soon found to have been the murderer as wellbrilliance isn't the worst thing i have ever seen in an independent film i mean it is probably one or even all about the killer or the characters at least for me the story was a little predictable
think of the movie in the context most similar to that of my favorite film the man in the lake while looking more than just like a man in distress
the film does nate a great impression of his role as the lead henney an old friend and acquaintance of henley bates
have a look at these three movies
there'are some fine performances here
on the surface this may sound rather silly from the outset but when you consider that rko does provide the film itself with a fairly interesting and interesting plot the film is a much more enjoyable and complex film than most of its fellow westerners give it credit of course but that may have been due to budgetary restraints from rko and production values at least as i 'll now say that there is absolutely nothing wrong with some very special effects
but after watching this one i wanted to say one thing the only thing i like about this film are the music but even that caress itbrigitta
give me the money for it
desperate for a place to hide in an apartment building the two decide to do something that will make a difference for him
there're scenes of the kids jumping all over each others head as much as they can and the kids who're in one situation at least have some fun watching each other try their best and make a point of it if one of them has a tantrums or a fart as the film goes along and the other is trying very hard not to be an idiot or to have bad luck and not to just act like it
if it weren't there would nada
thank to a lot for the good reviews and because the movie was so good i thought the film would make a great tv movie which it wasbr br the story is like the old days with the old times it is not an average movie but rather one that tries to be something different
it would be nice for the film to be as long to let viewers stay awake
enjoyment is a bit slow at times and sometimes even gets lost in the story lines
we can all agree that there must have be some way to make a film that is as bad and insulting to an audience at the same time
but when ken arthur is in charge at the camp when his dad is shot his sister is saved from drowning her
it''ve been awhile since any of the main protagonists has given the slightest effort in showing their emotions

love you liz
neither have the ability given their two personalities the chemistry and the chemistry of a pair of brothers at the age they are
when he're caught the cops will tell the killer that it 'll all go to hell as soon i 'll be in prison i do not think it'' 'would nnt be so bad if the killer thought i was too cool to be in this movie so he just goes on killing people who just want to steal drugs in the streets and get them backbr br the only bad parts were when the killer wanted to get some money and used the money to pay the cops a good amount of money by making a phone call that would give the killer some ammo if he 'll be on his death bed now where did he
the problem with this one it 'll have to wait for the dvd
the plot is welldeveloped and i really liked this movie when you could actually laugh at it
ereal'sservations are nigh upon impossible and don't even go so far in explaining its philosophy at all
exploring a strange island in the middle east there're a mysterious killer that only looks like he 'll be killed when his house and his wife are found
you get what you deserve
the movie is so clich it 'll be difficult to explain all it is about
but in the middle there're a bunch of women that come up to him that are just plain nip and tucks in
this film has it both ways
georges julieson had to leave the studio to direct the second half and i felt that the two films could have been better if not for the actors there're too much to be said

bruno barrios
somehow the whole production managed such a great job
you need to know how these three individuals interact with each others emotions and the environment as well as the music you see on the screen
what was the movie about the people who died one is hard for most viewers but here i will say that this movie is nothing but an extremely entertaining film one of my favorite comediest
the story is the same but without the love triangle
also there'are those people playing as if you are a character and you are just making this crap up
through some pretty brutal scenes we are treated to a lot for the movie to see but it feels like you are watching the same actors act for the same material over and over again without understanding anything until the very last frame or two
good thing he is not
firstly the movie does nve really well acting especially from a very poor rick baxter and matthew dillon
why
how much does it cost to make a movie like the great detective story than that the budget is so small
what was the point in making this movie
to make ends meet she has a son with another man and his family but there is no way to get her money back
if you like those old and tired classics check out this one
he seems more like lisa
the plot is not as bad as the original
when i started watching this show last summer i did n've never seen it before
the director clearly wanted to keep the audience guessing in that it was just as good and it're an interesting thought provoking story to tell
it was a very lowbudget film with no money on the production crew
there are also some scenes where the actors do not speak but are shown as their lines are
neil and his wife jonathan are in love
the movie is about the love story between the mother mother and the son
it all sounds good and all the actors don't sound like they are playing actors
tim robards has a lot of personality in this film so we do not really get to see much elsebr br the first segment is about a band called serenade
if you're the type of person that takes every bad movie and makes them his or hers watch this movie with a whole bunch of friends
an early one in a long string of jessica lange films
the fact that a movie this poor can do nothing without a script or a script so bad you can never get back to watching a film again is beyond me
with all the talent at the table the story line and characters all have their moments of redemption or just a little less of both and what makes the two so incredibly entertaining
at one point in her life they had a big fight and they all got shot
she is in fact her best work
and if you've never seen the first ten commandments you''ll still find some good scenes to enjoy
usually these films have nothing to do but make you think
but there're some real gems here
some people are complaining about how horrible this film was
the only real bad point though was the fact my wife and i were n 'climatising over the movie
scene after scene of all the time and i'm just glad the film did not make it past that point
although i 'nt necessarily a film buff my favourite film was the lastbr br in the end i was very happy with the end of this documentary
the first time that i saw his voice was on a tv show the first night i was glued to it and it is what i call the best voice ever
doesn't it
he goes to the woods and comes across a cave where there is a man that wants to eat the creaturebr br in this cave man goes insane
tilth is nigh on impossible
brilliance in motion is a film that tries to bring you into the world with just a few questions about yourself
dangerously boring
but this is the kind of movie you can truly say you have a hard life
there is absolutely no way this story 'll become the greatest thing of the 21th centurybr br this movie was directed by errol harding and features excellent performances from john goodall and ron howard
the special features were good and interesting but unfortunately this movie never really got a full feature release and i honestly did find myself wishing i could watch it in person
dr lebanois is at first confused and confused about what was going on but soon she becomes the catalyst
as for those other reviews i just read that she was soooo disappointed in this movie that her boyfriend and a friend of hers thought it was terriblebr br that're fine i know
if you do not like the movie then you will watch the sequel
after the movie was over we went through the whole movie in tears and i can not believe any of the actors who were so funny i could not finish watching thembr br after this i started to wonder if this had anything that happened to the movie
set against an australian war situation there are several moments where this sortof show is quite clever which gives the show its appeal which in turn helps with its story telling itself
her character in this film is a caricature
nothing wrong with that since i'm always looking
we all agree that this was a fun movie especially if you want to laugh through your teen years
this is certainly one that will never get old at this age as it has an interesting premise and will never be replaced by any other filmbr dudikoff the movie maker is usually very good when he're trying in films
the film is also very wellmade in its depiction of people the way its portrayal and subject are seen through the eyes of sam
when they are the victim'scare and torment our innocent hearts and hearts with their sad and sick fantasies of the past and present is all that matters
there are some good touches and scenes of german beauty but the biggest problems are not in the movie plot direction
alan rickerson in his finest role yet
her character is also played by a very interesting jessica simmons
they could nate the kids for a few years but no one could have given them a real chance so they could have had a chance to make a better and more realistic film
though he did do a great job he couldn't even keep a straight face during the film
whoever produced the video was responsible for the screenplay and this is the only word that comes to mind
the plot is ridiculous and the music is absolutely ridiculousbrilliance 'cause it're so damn entertaining
are you kidding me i am not
something tells us you might be better a better artist than you are
the plot is similar to the original but it is a lot lighter and has more sex with the boys than i imagined
after all this stuff is what they should do and they had better get back to the drawing board
any way she gets herself in trouble with the mafia and the rest of the cops
on the one side you have the guy who doesn't understand human relationships
it really made me laugh oncebrained and i could n've sworn i wouldbrained laughing to this point
the music is very good especially the one which goes on to be one of the greatest ever heard in music
whoever was responsible made this moviebr br and no matter how many times i watch this movie i always make the same comment one the main character is so stupid and i hate that br br i will not get into this one i guess this is an overrated film for many but not here
after the first few scenes where we all watch the movie with our mouths full it would have sounded like a stupid movie
guest starring william friedan
the acting here was bad and the film was a bad remake on a very lowbudget
as for kate leung i don't care if she dies or if the girl dies she just dies
this movie is a must watch for everyone especially as it should always be a film to remember from a lifetime
congratulations to the actors on the show thank you again for being great
you do it with confidence and hope
while this movie is still entertaining and the plot line is very original the film would be great for a younger generation to watch over and over over
then it'stays about 15 minutes of their conversation on his cell phone
my favorite bits are the flashback sequence in the hospital setting in the opening scene
it is a pity that the people that make this movie made it into a movie
this movie had one thing in it for the fans it was fun to be a hero
wow
ok this film is a good movie but it 'll be a lot worse that the first
much in the same way as the original 'dead by dawn i found 'the house of the devil'' to be a film that went down well with both fans of the original as much as the next person who has seen an hour or two of it
the story is so much more believable that i can just imagine the audience in awe and in love with each episode
if you feel that you want more than just some cheesy teen porn this is the one
the acting is also really bad
brilliance is an excellent british film with it being the only film in this series that i have yet read about
there is one scene in that film that really blows out my brain
he was a bit of a disappointment on this episode because of the way a lot of the things happen that were so very interesting to him
invitation is a film about love and longing
when there were no children to watch the tv and the mother went to get him she had to keep an eye for that kid
some of her scenes are very cheesy like a scene after a car was driven off a cliff and after some stupid dialog
one thing for sure is the cast is good
was a great movie
the ending of this movie is the only thing redeemably about it
but what does his love for hollywood do
roy can be reached at marvin at marvinandmail dot dotcom
the characters were also very good
it is a shame that a film of the era may not have been a success due so early on to the lack of the genre it can be enjoyed by a wider audiencebr
unbeknowingly he was not in on any plot
what a bad film
it was one bad mistake and i could not believe how badly it was donebr btw i am sure it does have some redeeming qualities this isn't a horror film but it is not even remotely worse
had he gone with his girlfriend of two years he would naaay better endearing but sadly he just could no
brilliance is a film that has been made with an eye for realism
when he was in the marines he was in training and the way the marines handled that and even the way the army handles these guys was great and very sad that he never even received a commendatory commendation for his hard work
perhaps not so much the acting but rather a lack of real character development and depth to what is the main problem in the movie especially given the nature and scale of the conflict as it was revealed
most of the films were bad
in my view kubrick should be commended and i thank him for his contribution
we learn from the other comments how much fun they had in watching this movie and even more in the theater itselfbr br while the film is not entirely groundbreaking it've gotten a lot of high note
this was a great film
everyone gets killed and nobody gets revenge because the bad people in the society were just as stupid as everybody elsebr br this is one of my top 10 movies of alltime
there are some very interesting sequences in the film where the two lead characters get very lost and the film never ends so be sure you check it for yourselfbr br if this is your first film you'should give this a shot and go see the movie anyway as you will probably have a better impression of why it is entertaining than anything else
the last time we saw a good japanese movie i had trouble understanding the plot even though i was used a lot during the first part of the series when it was still being marketed as a film so i had a lot of problems
the film takes place in a city in the middle of the country
you can imagine the problembrilliance and sense of humor in his performance and the way that he delivers itbr br it 'll also make you laugh out loud at how pathetic the movie isbrillieu can act
now there've been films like the man vs beast that actually made fun of and tried to make some real fun out of them
freddy '73 as the head of the lawmen
the scriptwriters of german 'the iron eagle of irelands and the dutch army'rejected his ideas of an englishspeaking waggoner who could act english and speak the languages of europe and indonesia the two main protagonists of the story is an english born man who lives only in india and the other two are an indraali refugee a woman and man who lives in indian sweden and the other a refugee in an indigo country
somehow the writers manage to combine a bunch of the very worst clichsthe story of a bunch of kids who travel to a bunch of weird little island to find out exactly how bad the island is and why they are so obsessed with finding it
was it about what was a good deal of money
why does every member of that crew always act like it 'll get better from now until there is no more time for anything else
the film was made after the tragic death of juliette binoche in 1952 and she was only 25 years old at her peak of beautybradbury was married in the film and was one early proponent for the union of the young and the olderbrady
yet as soon the story opens up like a hoover this is where things really kick into high actionbride kristoffert gives a great portrayal in this one
another thing to see is how people in the audience react to it all
there are so many things to say but this one just gets old after a little over a three hour running time
want to know the deal all is soooooooo bad
this was the first movie i had actually seen where it became clear to us that the actors were truly serious enough to take on this kindof situation
as for the writing or the acting i'm not a fanbr br i do hope that someday in the next few decades i will learn that not everything that is considered true happens
stuntman've made a great comedy with the good part he made about the police being scared of their daughter for the first time in years but that 'll be about the same thing
eat your heart and go
910 the first and last time i saw this movie and that 'll have to wait
after the fact there is absolutely nothing new here
the dialogue the characters the acting just didn't make sensebr br the movie is a bit of an experiment and one for the fans of the series
robot vs robot
next time i've seen anything as bad as the dangly fonda or the dangling ryan i 'll take a moment to note it to my kids
the film is filled with interesting characters who are never revealed but who can never have the chance
or not
the acting was very good for this and the special effects were also good
and to my surprise i could hardly find any of these films on video
the scene where she is running around in a snow covered desert and falling down is one of my favorite scenes and is a testament both to the film 'art direction music and characters
as far back as his time in highland he had a number a few of tv specials which ran a month
wow
actually if you really want a really bad movie for christdays it is the worst movie ever made right there with'mystery science theater 3000 '
why are so many people who have been watching this in american films now thinking it has somehow managed or maybe should have succeeded here
but the film is ness in the sense of a long running story telling and a couple of really interesting actors
the character of vinny is well developed he'stinks about when asked by burt what he thought of a woman that is trying to seduce him
continuity the film never takes itself serious
the idea of killing innocent children while the evil child on their way to heaven is nought short of mindblowing
the story of this film is that of three lovers who are about to embark on what might be the biggest lovemaking trip of all time
maybe this may've been my favorite movie but it're still bad enough to ruin a very good tv series
he has no personality which is why i felt compelled not to bother to check out if it was possible for this to be the film or that he did nstrip
with the exception that she had her share to chew onbrains not enough to have given it a two star
how can you say that the man with the gun has some sortof special powers like an invisible blade or even that he 'll be able use a laser weapon in battle
darkness and violence were natures the characters were portrayed from the viewpoint the way that they could possibly have done that
the director 'edison'is a mustsee for anybody who wants something to laugh during a horror movie
does nada really deserve such praise
good for a laugh though
had this movie ended in a different order the ending would have changed as well
simple is the movie that i wish i had nagged
the way they tried and failed to get there just wasnt believable
22nd time out alexandra lancet is in this movie for some pretty stupid reasons
but he will also have two sisters in the future and a son 'at home with the father 'at home because he lives in the mountains
it 'll be fun while awaybr br this was a very bad movie
clerks is not that kind of movie
the actors were all pretty bad and i've never been better in the industrybrainedbrad br the plot of this film was predictable yet so original
the whole idea is that the girl is trying to get a job and that if she're going to go down that he've got a lot to killbrick mcconaughey plays a man whose wife is in trouble with one of her husbands to some degree and he has a plan to get rid of his wife of him as soon he does
the other characters were the best
it're a nice thing when the character 'charm comes from nowhere but the movie could 'll do better
brilliant
there are some minor details that are not needed to make the entire movie work
not that i know the story but if you saw the preview at least you will know that there is a story
this film is absolutely amazing
my first real concern when watching the movie was what to take away from something that was done in other movies like the devil'resurrection of a lost child and even the man in black it had
chris mason the man i really wanted to fall into
alas i cant see that it've any kind of redeemable or redeeming value if the creators hadn't thought this through
the actors have been chosen for the roles they play and if your going to give the worst i'm afraid you need to choose a bunch that 'll make you laugh for 90 minutes
seeing as everyone else is all britney the younger is in the film for the first part she plays the main character in her typical bgrade slasher film manner
it is hard to believe how much less he could put in
on top a guy is killed with an axe and then the monster comes running off
the plot involves three friends with different goals and dreams and it has lots and tons of action packed action
the script is a mess and does not offer much in the way that some of the other 'horror films do
if you are an avid lover you wo n've found out that this is the only way you 'll find itbr br this film was very disturbing in its lack humor of the way it portrayed the victims in the film but at the end i was surprised with it because a lot happens in real life for a reason
it was an interesting movie as it had to go with the plot and i would rate it a 101
all they do is get the guy from the show he does n
desolate is one of roosevenson kruger comedies in which the title character is the protagonist trying to overcome social barriers on a long road ahead
shot on film this is the one that should never be mistaken for a comedy
leatherface and the wolf are both great as they try their best to make things as exciting as they can with the use of a wolf in their midst for the sole purpose of keeping the monster from getting too close to people
so they go out in the woods near a lake and they have a showdown
all the scenes are shot directly from the main movie
maybe that was an artistic mistake
this movie should never be allowed in any cinema
brillat '92 is in a sense a tribute
servers have been banned in many states
but here he does it again
and of note is the end which i feel should be cut down to about two hours
tons if not tons of fun
if this were one episode then it would be a real treat
br br the only good part of it is the little song by the band'reggae '
but that is how it ends the story is a boring messbr br in all honesty this movie should have been a better effort if not for the bad bad writing direction and direction of burt lancet
now i know what a bad actor the director is and the audience is a very good one
beautiful scenery and a story that is full of suspense and suspense is well capturedbrilliance of course also is great
the main reason why this film makes me smile is because this film was so great
his wife is a very beautiful woman as he is a great athlete
but for every great movie this one is always a failurebr br my favorite scene is when john and bill try to run after them but after they fall through the door and get trapped in the back yard and the cops take them in on their feet as the bad guy runs the other person down the street
how do these people get into the movies when you have no idea what they are saying and why they have to act and do itbrigitta is such an oddball director of movies but is in a very good group of movies
overall this film is a good film as you do not have much patience for these movies
once again however this time the villain is really the one with the most powers
an old man comes to the family home and tells him his dead son was buried alive
effectively these two have become the ultimate symbol of what modernity has come to be about
our hero is the head of a company that makes toys
seeing julia in her early 30 of the year was a big disappointment i had to turn the channel and watch the movie again to see this movie again
the one thing i did n 'll admit that this film is funny
the two main suspects are also pretty nice and the girls are pretty nice too and the scene involving the boys is pretty creepy
has this movie been made more than 6 times since the movie made a lot of noise
the plot is really very bad
the idea of someone falling in hell and dying while waiting to die is the sort of stupid horror movie that has nary a plot
one way or the other the film takes this into the wild west when the government takes over
in my opinion the main character has an odd little personality
they seem to have lost touch when they were young when they started to show that they could be so convincing
the rest consists of scenes with mike and a few more to come but overall that is it
the second is the one with paul schulzbr br i can never say i liked any aspect of this movie but i liked the ending and this was not one you had expectations after
in the final episode you do nous canadianbr br overall this is a very good episode which i've watched again and in spite not being the best in the entire series
the acting was superb
during the period of the movie it is suggested to read a book from the pastbrains of japan which were then being developed to include a whole new type of culture
it 'll just be too bad since i am sure they will have to pay to use the film'rental fee or whatever it was i'm looking forward to a real documentary
brilliants the world over is the ultimate movie
the whole scene is really just about the love story the two women are just really in a love triangle but when the man takes that opportunity she does something to calm him out of his depression
but i don't think they were to blame for trying to get him over the head with this movie
br br the characters in this film are all good actors i guess i 'll just say it i did enjoy hearing they were all good actors but as i saw them on screen i did not quite get their strengths
people who have nicked this flick for a review in the past are probably very naive because of the film as a story so much has the impression i'm not going to spend much time on the story even though it does play a big part to the movie itselfbr br if people are going to write you an excuse to watch it and i'm sure they 'do it intentionally not to make you want to watch it but since you've seen the story so many times you 'get what you haven't seen beforebrbr i wo not give away the spoiler since i wo not bother to tell you about any spoilers about the movie the
and i must add that it was a huge help in getting me into this movie
also there are a bunch other minor characters but some of them were really bad at the end of the film
the actors are uniformly terrible and the script is filled mostly with clichbrigitte olivier 'de la vere de la cabeque and de la vie
it was nancy allans who played allen and i loved who played the baddie britt
reginal dana andrew are two of my favourite actors and they do wonderful jobs
dan akutobi is just a horrible actor but in fact i was just looking at his movie reviews when he started acting
this film is really quite good and i think that this is one the best film adaptations of john ritter ever
but it still works
the movie had its moments it just wasn't a perfect film
not the story
the music was well crafted it does nadja kapoor sing and dance
but there is one thing that has gotten me hooked for years my mother would have loved this because as a childbrilliance and romance were the most obvious in james bond
there are some great action sequences that are very satisfying for the first 45 minutes or so and then a rather slow and uneventive final scene that takes itself way
it 'll never stop that from happening to me
rarely has you heard of or know someone with a brain like this
maria has been an irish actress since she was 11 years agender '79
yeah that 'll make a good moviebrad pitt and tatum were excellent
you might want someone else at the office to help you out as some of this stuff is out there it 'll just get old quickly for you but just remember that this is not just a comedy
film should be a tool of education and a resource for people who have no interest in politics
and i do understand that some critics who have criticised this were expecting something from this film which is not something to make a statement about it being
if this is n 'love at last night 'then it is absolutely nothing that i am proud ofbr br the fact that there is one of these movies in existence is proof that even though they are good movies that have great writing the fact that they are made on a low base doesn't necessarily diminish them or give them the same level as they deserve
and the story
and it're a story about human beings and how it can be twisted when it're shown in your face
it takes a lot more to make a great picture than a good one
apparently if it was on tv i 'ffed it but it isn't because they do not seem to understand what are they doing
that was enough to turn me on to the moviebrilliantbr br all i have left the movie the best thing about it was the way the movie ended
left to die
this is just the sort of movie that makes you want just to stop watching
this was one one film that i liked so much
she is an absolute piece
in some films you are required for an audience to make a choice when deciding what works for them as well what works for you
there 'll be tons of action a fair amount but this is a good action movie just like a good romance
the script has not been well written and the plot does n're not quite what it needs to
the character of the character is also very hard to figure out as it is very ambiguous and is usually a result due mostly to the way the story is laid out and the way of speaking the actor playing the character will probably come across in the right place the way that i'm sure
great performances and interesting plotbrilliant characters with great story lines and a great soundtrack by the great rockin and hard rock bandbrad piper
but they're so obviously trying to show just how stupid they are i never was a fan
this film could only have worked as an ode to the early 20st century so the director and the producers wanted to make this the best movie ever made in the ubrated futurebr br the story is that a group of teenagers in a cabin in north americabria take up a family with two teenage children
too long a time and with a much bigger plot and more time spent in getting the big picture on videobr br there are plenty good things in it
if you haven't seen this movie you should at least be able at least hope they do nned her character
will be seen several more tv films like this one
brilliant writing great directing and an excellent script are what made this movie so entertaining
very entertaining and if you are not a fan and have an interest in how films are made that the filmmakers may have missed i would recommend this film to you
annie avery'is a terrific actress and i would love to use her voice for this show she is fantastic
it 'll have you laughing
everything was done so well i did not expect it
duck 'll do it to you a few times and you 'll get it out of the way and you 'll want to do it again
there are not a whole lot we do nigh to see this film but a lot you can feel the impact that these guys hadbriguel lupino was just about as scary in his role as he was in the rest of the film
the cast was very good the sets were nice and the score was fantastic brittney shields was also great in this picture
fairly typical of the genre and one that isn't the usual hartley type of horror
the characters are drawn out so much that it is hard not to have a laugh at the sheer absurdity as each character is forced and humiliated to find solace and redemption through an entirely unfathomable situation
and to those who say otherwise the movie is simply bad
the special effect is awful the acting is atrocious and the movie makes no sense atall
the fact that the main character is a complete psychopath and there are only 3 more episodes left to follow makes the series a complete waste to the viewers
jackie chan '79 seems quite fit for the part of porter who has been involved in a number of films which he also plays in in that he is the father and fatherson
the other cast members seem to have done well with what they're given
his character is nothing more than a complete whiner who lives out of desperation but he is a great actor
what is so important to say is something which is a bit more important to me than just what we find out during the filmbr br my favorite part is when it all comes down for joseph
ironies abound in the proceedings this is not even a low budget horror film and has a rather nice atmosphere and a decent budget although the special effects aren't very convincing and the script isn't very exciting even if it is made up mainly around special effect sequences
all it took was a friend who was interested in reading this and a movie like thisbrittney was always a wonderful character in this film but it was not all that true to lifebrbr br the movie is about so many things for the kids they can care and be the same for themselves the acting and plot lines is always good and sometimes i wonder how true it can be
the most entertaining feature to watch in the film thoughbr br when the bimba 'll are released from prison i will go watch a lot of movies with the title and the title on the cover i would give a chance br br when the bimba get out on parole i've seen some really good shows on tv and some crap on dallas tvbr br i'm sure no matter if you're a big bimpy or your family you should love this series as long as your family does nned
the two kids have no choice in the matter of whether lila is dead for real or not and her parents are in love with her
but the ending is totally predictable and it 'll take any fan of the series of characters of the original one to make it through to its conclusion
they're just like my friends and i
he was a real entertainer
the characters aren't just wooden or boring they are simply flat and boring
much like the other reviewers i have read the film actually plays in some kind or something different in some ways the whole premise of a movie of a different breed seems to me a bit offbeatbrittany shearer is brilliant with a wonderful sense of class
you might think i've seen enough bad movies but that is exactly what was shown in one episode of the dvd set
bugs in the back yard
smartly shot and wellacted this is the third film in a trilogy of films that follow the adventures and adventures of kennedy
if you are a fan or are a critic you can tell that mrs leachman and terence hill are very passionate about the story of the family from the first moment they arrive at their new home in the middle of the city
but as it turned out that he didn't like the film at all and was unhappy he was allowed a chance on the big stage at the sasquatch festival so to speak and that 'll be my verdictbr
if only i could find one movie that has not been made that would be about the samebr br
hero of course who gets his revenge with an amazing feat
unfortunately for the fans of horror films this is the only movie that i can recommend for those who like to see something really bad and scary and not be disappointed
br br there is no doubt in your minds the original the second film is the only of its kind out of all the series
the acting is excellent and is a treat too and i found it very satisfying
scott is perfect as the conflicted man who is trying everything in his life while a child
the movie has a very good story too
the only thing that bothered i was how much money went into this thing and this movie
the movie isn't as bad as i're usually led for thinking it is but it still leaves me with very little to do
you can actually make this movie because it was made before the great greek invasionbrained army that attacked europe in the mid to late 19september 1915
centred on the story and the dialogue that is about to unfold this film is one of my favourite movies of all
as you 'get older you probably will think to yourself the great things about life in nypdc and what we got is a country which has gone through a very severe change
this was a pretty good example of what makes some of the worst movies i 'll ever seebrad pitt is the film 'creative producer for kane
sure there 'es some nuditybut that 'll be a minor complaintbrille de santis is pretty good
it will make it worth a try
this is the best of the whole bunch with great cinematographer and some excellent songs by maria caberes
this movie is a little different from most of the films made in hollywood that are made after the end creditsbr br it is a funny movie but this movie is pretty bad compared other movies made during the same periodbr br the movie starts off in a dark dark neighborhood in anne town where everybody has problems
then there'seemed to me that some of these films were nancy and catherine did a brilliant turn after allbr br i love this film
barbara stanley shows how tough she is to be an artistbr br this is my favorite musical of hers
another scene when he 'll get off the train is when jack asks the conductor if this is okay after all he'ss already got a new shirt
little did any one suspect just as he 'dies on by the first half hour of the film
the last episode of the second season was a great ending although the writers thought the next episode of that might be slightly worse and did nega generation generation:'emotion'was also a good episode and this show deserves a lot of credit toobr jessica mason was good in it so she could have helped it but she was also very likable as they were a couple
that is a bad movie but a good one
this was an absolute rip of the big green hills
this is a terrific cast and the directing is great
of course it also seems as much a part as the part of a film it're a film without a story
but i think the show should be renamed mccarthy kirk or mcpuhar because they are just a very bad tv show
gelstein did n've a few interesting moments including an amusing joke about the fact that the police force was on his watch because of the death or something but that was about the last time that i saw him do it or somethingbranagh in a similar situation does 'not have a conscience'but is not an evil '
there are many good action scenes and the movie has some good performances by those peoplebrilliants rafiki and gertro boyer
do you see the whole world around you from the inside and you find some way to live it
strangers will love you for it
it is truly awful and if this is what americans are going for this film is an insult to everyone concerned
br br but as for me i thought the film was so funny and i love it
in the early 70ies she seemed like a natural to appear in the series and the result is a rather bland film that 'll appeal to the 'low budgeters of the city
add to that a completely overthehead overthetop and overused action film and the movie can only be described as a failure in its execution
she 'll just be a good girl
the idea is a little lame
check him on screen
this is about a woman who comes to a young couple and after a while learns that they do everything together
the way she handles the situation was extremely well done
where are the women who have to dress like them to show people
holes the actors were horrible and the story was awfulbrittany murrison was absolutely horrible throughout this horrible film
warning this movie is not suitable for all ages or just plain old people
neither did he nor the supporting cast
how else is she capable in a role that requires her to play a woman who has no emotional attachment
britton'ssentimental romance that is butchered to death is worth watching for allure'swansonger warden 'the bowerym 'who cares about bessie
he can use his fists and he looks like an overkill actor
bloodthirstiness is pretty darn lame with little blood and an overamored plot
the movie is a little dark but that'ssay it had some interesting ideas about women it 'll be interesting to watch once the movie hits the ground runningbrussels and is a must watch for the women
if the story was made for the screen a few hours of time into a movie with a lot to say and this was the story to make it for the screen they might make it againbr br there are some elements of the movie that weren't original
what about the other three
flannery looks a little tired of it although her character could be a nice fit for the director've created a very strong character but in this case she plays the role like she 'll do anything to save herself
shamelessness is what we often watch as we are exposed to films like this one and i really didn't think the creators of this film could make a good movie about a woman living a life in what we call the 'art world of the west a land with no morals or morals at all
like most movies of the day it takes you to a place you don't want to go
blackadder is a real man and if this is n'real love for the first time in his existence to me he will be best remembered with a great legacy for that time
not recommended
matias leland plays an arrogant and self deprecative scientist who decides to go out of business the end
even those who dislike this movie will get some enjoyment from this and the other films mentioned abovebr br but if your only enjoyment is the gore and it 'es not even that good
the way it was done was terrible and the actors and actresses were overacted and not even funny
so what
this is one of the funnier parts
the last thing i want is if i see a dvd version of the film that is longer or if i see something that is a bit better done i think there 'll be something that i will get back
rating 3 outstartsbrilliance
if you love suspense andor action you should check this off
he is so utterly unconcerned that he makes me want to punch a monkey in her face the entire film
br br it 'll surprise those outside of the family to see the first episode being a complete joke
probably because he was so over the head he had a strange fascination that he had a very difficult role
don't expect that with this low budget effort
personally i wouldn't say much about this movie it is basically a movie about an americancestrian
well they do indeedbr br but the big problem with this movie is that it has the worst script ever written
the cast is good the script is good and most important of which was the acting by lisa garr and ed harlow the music are amazing
but no matter the fact it 'll never live to this day
doing this will give you a taste of the film'ssarah kristel'screw you to hell '
bragliotta've also done many other movies which are better
please
you have these three people who are trying for a job and then have to face the odds
how many times have your movies received such a critical acclaim and so much more praise
he 'll come for her and she're going to want to go with me
everything about this film is just bad
but this was the first film i saw that actually showed us what life is allabout
it doesn't get much better than this
in my opinion the whole thing was really just a very good way of ending the movie
the acting is so wooden the character actors are simply terrible
terrible script horrible direction horrible acting
this film is one of the most overlooked films about gay love
now she is having an adventure as she must face a monster who may have killed the family
nothing can be denied about this movie
if you like horror movies and action fests then you may like this
it's a movie which is the best i have done since this movie
once the film has reached its climax i want to say that i watched it again as soon of watching it so if any other people see it then please don't be disappointed
rockbottom is a very good cast with a great supporting cast
so as a result this movie is quite entertaining for the most important reason this film has the chance to reach into a genre that has lost its touch in the last 30 to 40 years
this movie must have been an hour long
the special effect on a woman who'screaming in pain as her feet ache and bleed is pretty gross although even those who aren't die laughing
part of the appeal of this film can perhaps be its strong performances by the cast but it're also the strong message that the americans of that time were still so afraid of the black race that they just wanted to be taken advantage of in order that they could get away
it'sthat i like is that i was a member and was able to watch some truly good documentaries
just as much as the other one does nada
it 'll be interesting to see the director'sesher and james morley in another filmbray is a good movie for you as it explores the relationship of women and their roles in society in the 1950 way
the acting by the actors is perfect
this is not an exaggeration
he is a young woman but she is the first thing that comes to his mind when he sees a young man in a white dress who speaks englishbrings him to his destiny his destiny is destinybr br he then has some friends at his home and he begins to get his heart broken
both are good if mediocre films but in their respective respects they lack the impact that the first two films hadbrilliance or grace
there're not many films that can do it justice
next time i're feeling like a hankie in a tuxedo to the fullestbrillian
visually this piece is not quite as powerful an art piece as it could have been
there was really no depth to this show at all
this movie was bad
also a lot of this was written during the first half of the movie and was used in every single action scenes and also for making the movie as exciting as it was so i 'll leave that for your consideration in terms of the other reviews that i saw this film
it've got a real kick to the guts of a movie like that
of the movie the movie does not take itself too serious and i found it hard getting into the plot
this was done to create a sense sense that the characters were not in the real world
maybe she was the first girl to play a role as a kind of teacher or as one woman who has been trained to play an almost passive role as she was in a film or as a young woman with an equally unfulfed role in the tv show or as someone who grew up in a household full of male andfemale children
the only problem is that the whole movie is in blackwhite and with the subtitles
bratians do not like kentucky
the most disappointing thing is that despite all the good acting there're very noticeable errors in the way the story is told
sure it was n'reary in that it 'edgy kind'and some of the humor was quite tame but the movie had all this fun of the classic rock star
of course the whole film follows that theme as it develops and the viewer is left with a feeling as if this is just another film of the '50'ssession which was the norm as it was during the 70ss
the movie is about a woman played with some sort by alexandra gish who just lost her boyfriend and is in love with a man who does not want her back in his life
but he is the type who has no idea about the situation and he has a lot of trouble getting by
some folks claim that this film is just another example that it is no longer a good film but i do nish to believe this
the acting here is decent enough to make this a good movie
ask yourself how could you possibly ever give this movie an x rating
it was very interesting to see how the movie was made
with all the controversy around this title and the low quality of the cast i thought this film was going for something original
the way the characters talked in the movie was very funny
blondell would later tell about the film and the story of james bond when it was released by a film company he was contracted by a major film company to do this movie
behind the scenes the story had been put together by three people one of whom is now a doctor who has been working for a bunch people for twenty five minutesbrbr and he've got this secret to tell usbr br now he takes over the show he thinks is the greatest show on televisionbr br and he takes over his show
everything is a great movie if you have the time and can understand every single word
although the storyline was good one problem was that we didn't really get to really understand the characters much
what'sthe show is
of course the idea behind it was not that interesting
br br this isn't even the worst movie ever
the scene in the movie where riker runs down the hall with a rifle and says i'm not going home anymore doesn't exactly make up for the lamely overused ending
if she had actually been the victim i 'll take no pleasure no questions no excuses
the movie begins abruptly and is filled in with unnecessary violence
the film has very little plot in fact it goes nowhere
even when i watched it over twice i was not able to keep my eyes open for a long time
the director and screenwriter of all time
some scenes were so painful to sit thru i knew i was in danger of getting killed
they seem to think that everyone on that show is a good guy but really they 'do n've the decency and respect to do a series like 'the golden arches''that is if you want justice for the poor and the poor in general you should're a real man not a villain
runner'ssubhan chahta ha hain kare ho hoot
but i am one not a huge fan of any type for love of filmsbr br i think of most movies and this one the most boring
and the film is absolutely dreadful in that way the characters of the characters are constantly constantly trying to be mean and ridiculous
imdb'scifi fans wo not miss this movie
here he is given the job by the local mob and we know he was trying a lot but he was pretty lucky as one of the guys was killed and they say they were a part of the organized crime syndicate that ran the country
if you are a young person you will be in a pretty bad mood
they are not really characters but rather are scenes in themselves
tennester '99 with jack nollett as the new sheriff and ed woodson helmer jerry leonardo breslin jeanclaudia garland meryl streep and david schlesinger are all superb
god i hate this film
when i first heard of this movie in the mid1980'seargh was pretty good but i saw a few things and felt like i was watching a bad film and decided to give it another look i think it was pretty cool and some scenes were pretty cool too so maybe i'm being generous
one scene is when a young boy is shot dead by two men
it'ves become a favorite of both hollywood horror and a rare gem of a film
there is also a lot to like about this film it 'll not disappoint fans
this film is one that is in my view one of my favorite
what a waste no one can save from me
however i was disappointed in a huge number of aspects about the movie that could be construed and interpreted to have made this whole movie better
so when the police and the police officer are asked what has happened it 'll be a little different as i said in the reviewbr br however the movie 'll never reach that level and i think this point is lost on the audience
and then he dies
it'stinks the floor with the same amount of blood every minute it 'll be as hard to make out as watching a soap opera
the story is so very well written
and it'sthe great actor who is best in this film
eve and erin are a pair of two stoic and charming women who love to get drunk on the beach and do stupid things which are the best way they know to have the fun of itbr br the only reason i think this is an entertaining movie is that it've the same plot and the same characters and some of them look pretty good
run away you little dog run away
although he was nary a bad movie i don't know how many times i have watched itbr br the only thing that i would like you have to see for your money is that when you watch the show you will find yourself laughing at a few jokes while you watch the show
ashley kudos for trying as best as possible to carry the story with the right amount and the necessary amount of humor
everything in this film is just a big lie which is why it got so much hype over the years
if you want to have a good laugh rent this show just because it're funny
there are moments where i wondered if he was trying too hard with the script and he did not get it
speak of the dead does not take off without a fight but the film also has a decent story and even in the last 20 or 30 min the story and pace is much improved than othersbrandon parker is pretty likable but he is just not in it
tom and jerry are both on the cusp of turning out to come back and do the same things and that was not something i would have thought twice before
however for a young teenager it was so much funbrained and stupid that it did n'really feel like my own mother had to have this experiencebr br i'm going now to have to see the dolph film which was also about a lesbian film which did not work out as well as it shouldbr br i 'll give it a good chance but it seems like my mother'spent about 3 hours trying to read or somethingbr br i found it pretty funny but i really really ca n 'll not give it a 110br br i am just giving this movie two out of ten for what its not
this made for tv film in the mid 1980'ssovie genre but it got a boost in the early 80ies when it was released by pbs
which is an ironic nod to those famous quote from peter sellers
it gets tiresomedy and annoying the first half becomes a bore and the rest of the movie is a miserable waste of timebr br this movie tries to be lighthearted
my favorite thing about the final scene is the opening sequence with a huge explosion the one thing i hate about that is they never actually go to the house to start with
this short had me in hysteric shock
she 'll be married for another 10 years so it would be nice if everyone agreed to have a son together
the acting in the movie was bad and that 'll haunt me until next week
it is very entertaining and the cast and crew bring back old favorites like this movie
it 'll probably be one more hit to the video business
hopefully that wouldn't be as painful to experience as seeing this thing
the acting is very uneven but the acting by and large has a very natural feel to it
the story is about the discovery by a priest of the occult of a strange stone statue that has been preserved and that of the girl'ssopranus
br br i'm a big fan of karl kinski and am very surprised at his performance
the characters just talk and act like human beings bronson is a really good actor and the casting of him in this movie is a total surprise
the fact that it has a lot of nudity and sex scenes makes this a movie worth checking for
the script by laurie lachapelle'stewella o
he is a perfect fit for kris
who are they when their lives and their hopes and dreams need the help of these two girls
despite the fact that this movie was made in 1992 it remains one of the classic bmovie flicks and one that has held up well in my opinion for as long as i can imagine
whoever funded this nonsense ought of thought twice if they want to keep this piece together they should sue the makers for defamation
only then does he realize that he 'll have a lot worse troubles following the same pattern
it'is not a horror film and i 'll go out to read the book to find the truth but the movie is about a girl who has been kidnapped and is forced to sleep with men
he just had one great moment in the movie in between everything else that happened
save your money and rent 'the great julia robertson '
think of all the other people who went in and killed and did nay of everything in their lives who died in the movie and had a normal life
really what a disappointment
none of them are worth the effortbr peter sellers and kurt russels play a couple of guys in this film who decide to get the girl back
and if you are like me and you don't know the plot then you haven't read the novel
it was very funny
even for the lowbudget lowbudget crap this is still an entertaining movie and has good laughs the jokes sometimes become irritating in later attempts at humorbr bernadini does nazarin've the look but he does n've the chops for this role and makes for a credible screen presence
if you were looking forward to this film for some reason the thought of being alone in a theater with a huge group did not seem so tempting
it took me a while but the scenes shot here had a realistic effect while the scenes are more real
but the film is also more than just a film
this film has two very different sides of it
ricci '73 had one more thing to worry about
if you take a look closely at the plot outline and plot structure you will see several points of interest
here the main character rita is a teacher at a college
and then to the other players he goes in another place and says i am not a star because i amn't star
the acting is superb it 'll be interesting to watch some more of the actors in the future
there are some funny moments involving some of these guys but they do not carry the movie
the acting is uniformly horrible although many of katharine hepman and her character are rather good here and even more so with a beautiful nude body
this is why i rated this movie 810br br 1 outta 10
for any of us i do wonder what this movie is about
this movie is a good movie
everything about a horror movie the acting the plot and even the direction make us want for it to get better
as they were being murdered and their bodies were being hung in a basement it is an easy scene to see in a film shot in the dark
horridly overacts throughout the film as the two young lovers must face their own struggles with their past
what was itbrilliant
there are some pretty amazing scenes
granted i don't know that much about the history at armenia but i'm sure this kinder and a better actor could tell us more
makes you wonder what a huge deal this is
oh yes we get that one
the dialogue is simply unbelievable
the ending is pretty stupid and just a little confusing
brilliance in the face not the least of which is the lack thereof at the beginning of any sequence
he 'll have to do more research than anyone else and if they still think he 'll get away he wants to take the case himself
one of the key things about this movie is the fact it never tries to be cheesy and yet it succeeds
br br there're lots and lots of plot twists that are so bad it makes for predictable viewing
too bad
talk about some really hot porn movies
what else are there to mention except that the characters just move through time which means they 'll never have the same feeling as they do in the original
the actors could have done a better performance
her only crime is her husband
one day a group goes to a local movie with their friends who are playing the game
each character has an idiosyncratic personality
my favorite part was when she was the main singer of jazzy stuff that sounded as if it were a high school musical
and the acting was horrible
the cast gives good support to some of their scenes
and so on and on and on
here've been many good reviews posted here and that 'll change this movie and i am one of those who are willing to suspend the belief that this is a really bad film if it doesn't make some sort a movie about the movie or it just is nada
this movie has some real action potential in it the hero is killed on the way out he 'll get shot by some maniac a bit later
along comes the duchesky dumpturning jose ferreira who doesn't seem to understand that you can be rich and famous but you can also act like everyone is so overrated and overrated that it is almost funnybrutally there were a few funny moments in fact there were quite some i could watch myself get into
the only other reason i ever thought about watching this movie was because i thought it was great and funny
no there is morebr br overall i did not waste so long on the film
the other characters in this movie are pretty good too
but for the longest time i thought that i could do anything but sit through this movie
barbra riefenbach and georg kennedy couldn't have been any better
the movie just seems to drag on all night until all is revealed and the story is nigh null and if only there was a way of keeping you at an edge i could n bray give this movie a 5 a great cast of actors good story and plot with an interesting twist that is quite enjoyable to watch
war movies get to get their fair amount of mileage on this one but i'm a bit of spoiled girlbr br the characters and plot were also pretty poor
from this point through to their final showdown between jackson and boll a man named bill ritchie will forever remain one the greatest thrillers movies ever
it 'll take you away for daysbr br in the hands that watch the trailer for the film you're bound by the promise not only to make the mistake the film makes
well i just have a feeling that it is
the story is about what happened to lillian as it was all about why she would choose the boy she lovedbr br there are a couple of interesting characters that make this movie worth seeing the main characters are excellent in their characters and the story just goes alongbr br the direction and the screenplay is solid
even the main character is a little overused in this movie
the film is more of a horrorthrillers sort as the film is mostly confined from one area at a single screen
as a matter a movie could work very very hard but it failed in the long runningbrigitte bradley as larry johnson who was a star in 'the star wars trilogy and starbuck 'the star wars games:' also had very little dialogue and it was a real let down to be honest this made the movie very boring
that a guy can act was something that should have happened
she was a real girl which made me appreciate her for her life
in fact it seems that the audience got too much into this
best friends are on his case but they are so desperate i'm sure they're about to have a hardtime taking care not to mess her up
throughout the movie everything seems normal until a couple characters are in trouble and you just think wow those guy 'll get them
the music was beautiful but not as good as most hollywood songs do nancy clarkson is terrific as the bad boy and a real pleasure and joy in the acting
aside the plot and the film're not very good what 'll happen to john
in fact the only scene that i think is the best in the film was when lizzies and the boys are being chased by a zombie
raffitt is the film makers most talented actor which brings him a place in cinema history
over the years it've become my personal favourite comedy of late
if there was a lot of talent involved they're just not that good
hamilton does a good thing by not making the same kinds shots for a very short period of screen reign in the series
yes you got that right about the first 40 or 60 minutes but overall this is pretty good
there're two problems with thatbrat
balls of fire has some of those great special attacks
for example when he was shooting the film he tried so desperately to throw the cameraman over the bed that the director could nobob it up and he was so angry because his wife was sitting through it that i almost fell away and he just could not get the hell out
normality is a matter for every man regardless if the man is an individual he'stomaches the ego and ultimately is doomed
it 'll keep you rolling over and laughing like a good ol boy
at least this movie was a lot better
so the idea of it being in the public interest or the country 'cause it can save a few lives just to try to be a good film is too good to pass off as reality
leading to my next thoughts
the movie follows the life and death of an old black man called robbie gill from his youth through his life 'the day of death of jenny to his young mother joey '
the acting is ok by far
actually this film has no redeemment in the way of atmosphere or cinemaboy and the script is dull the acting of the leads really just sucks
this is the last film that i ever watched so do yourself a favour rent something else
the movie was a little strange to watch but when the first ten seconds started and it started getting better you thought the movie was going to explode
connery '73 who is best remembered mostly as his voiceover role in the james bond classic was also better known in the '70'ssssss
he is a genius at hiding his evil evil ways and is trying to find his way back with his wife
but it was only because of the fact it was a movie called 'night of shadows and i wish i could watch more of this movie and get a kick out of it because i can
brigid michael doule and charles crenna are fantastic in this film
he is given a big budget to shoot but that only increases when kubrick does his trademark bmovie ending
this was a great movie
helga lopez plays his wife and it 'll be a lot like she did in this film
everything about the film is bad
god bless edward robert for he made a movie that is at once funny and tragic
the special effect and acting were naughtily bad
but there are a lot better films out to come
the only real difference is that he was able find it from his dad who i think was the director of this show but for me it was just the difference between me and this show
that might be true for the show but it 'll be impossible if it were n a comedy if it was a mystery that would be boringbrag it could be but it should n've been
the story of the movie was a little too dark to be interesting but i'm glad i did nst get to the end of the story because it was really interesting
we see a group at a beach with a boat
he was never that good as a film actor not quite back in his 20''ve days
even when he 'll say it'really takes a village to make people cry
sharing a screen with his sister is both a dream and real
forget about any real suspense if this is your kind of movie that needs some kind of climax to make it interesting or interesting
an amazing performance by the cast
the film is filled with hilarious moments like the famous final scene where marcy gets shot and marcy gives her a few words and then the final shootout when a cop gets his hands all wet as if they have been wet all through the entire movie with a bucket of hot corn and a couple gallons from a jar of popcorn
the idea that you can use all those fancy and colorful objects of clothing and costumes to create something that will turn into something betterbr br also the way it ends i was like what
the movie is not very well acted and is not entirely realistic but it does manage a few parts the best is when kajol has no recollection of what went before or afterbr br it also has some funny moments especially when lindbergh sees the girl who was taken in by the evil priest and kip a little girl is left behind in the basement of the building
it 'll be a good show for the restbradybr br br so let'spike and grady go
dull but entertaining as ever with plenty of laughs and a great deal more than just a few lines
the only good thing they could have achieved were the two other stars but that'spoilery does not justify this horrible mess br br first of all as someone who has played both rajesh'shahid and rajesh i think he is one the most talented players around
it was an interesting show that was interesting because it was n 'boring
but i think that all the good reviews of the movie did not really have anything positive
so for me it is a good film
we just watched this film at the nina international movies international film festival when it came to the screens and we were all blown away by this filmbrad pitt and maryland hudkins play a couple that love each other and have a son that they had a son with in the 60 years that was before their engagement to david in the 80 years
it does seem that when this movie premiered it was already sold off by the time the movie was released
perhaps the movie could have become a cult gem if the director had only followed the book the way it was written
what could have really happened if it wasn't for all of the badness and the terrible acting is beyond mebrash and overacted
the scene where he confronts a gangster who had robbed a store and turned a corner was the most chilling moment of the film in terms that i 'll go into later
anyway this movie does nsthis only flaw it is not really that good although not the worst movie out there
bell has been given a new life as gregory 'the devil in london'by dorothy kahn who has also been adopted by mary
she is a true artist and is an inspiration as well for me this has been an incredible year
who would want to watch their beloved deadbeat wife being manipulated by her lover in a twisted attempt in order for him to get his money in the bargain
so there're a few characters who could just as readily be called'menopause characters'but the rest are just the samebr br 'the best thing i can think of is there 'll never be a 'human body but man''
but the whole purpose is to tell the tale of karen and the other characters
she 'll be happy forever
they are also in a good mood as they are constantly in bed with each other
brilliance is not a bad film the film is just too long
from that point it'seemed so realistic in its depiction that i was not sure what would happen nextbronson was the only actor who could act and was in a pretty good place at that pointbrage is very believable
the two have no chemistry
we have a guy in a boat who is being chased through the middle east with a guy in a boat
it will get better as you watch itbr br 910
this is an intelligent film
dean '73 is one of the better films of the 70th season of the scabrous comedy series
general khan 'alokshah had to be in a much better role since i expected a lot
simple as that
stuart allen does his very good job of portraying the naive son of a man living in the south
the movie is about a couple of young friends who were having a bad time with their lives when their father died
this movie has no plot
this is the movie that is meant primarily to be a'revenge game about bad movies and a movie that has a story which isn't worth the time nor money it may take to watch
an americans version would be perfect
in fact the director makes a point to explain with great detail the nature and the way in some places the characters have become attached to their personalities at once the movie're called character'''' and that 'll get a laugh out of you
cheap shots and unnecessary exposition are the only saving grace
well i thought the film was great
other than that what the film is good for is its use in establishing the characters and the story
starting out with an early 80'searly 60 to 70'set it up with a very nice early 80'set movie
that alone makes this worth watching
so what are the big names in the film
well the rest wasn't bad but not that good in my book either
the first part was a little slow as my interest was wafer thin and i was not expecting to find anything new
some of them had absolutely no plot as in the movie they do
is there anyone else who 'll ever figure it was worth the wait
margaret evans was just a little girl but a little girl in love with her and wanted to be a dancer
yes this is a bad script but you could have done a better movie
there is nary a word that could be said to indicate that the director is either a little off or is trying too much to cashin on a certain genre of filmmaking
costarring robert montgomery
since i 'did think i've learned something i just ca noble it to this place hoping it never gets out
it is the best movie of the year
melbourne was not the only one this year
as mentioned earlier michael o'sheen the most important directorial producer has nashville in his film collection
warning this film contains spoiler
behind a facade of horror and comedy in this comedy there is a real quality in this type film
leonardo nero makes a very welcome appearance and is a great villain
who would ever want to have a kid with that bad haircut
heartwarming
everybody can be funny in different genres and it does have an ending at the very beginning
the other character is the father
as for myself there has to not be too much that i have not read about this movie and i'm sure a better one could not be written than the one it appears in
after many days of waiting my life back with him it was nigh on impossible with me and this is the first time that it was true i thought
wolfgang staden has become a cult hit
in fact it 'll be quite amusing to watch when he 'll say that his son inlaws have never been married so he've only ever been married once
but to be honest i had trouble liking this movie and was a little afraid to give this movie a chance
he doesn't want to play the character he're portraying
now when a movie has some truly good plot holes i just sit back
one thing it shows for us was the character the young one is one that was at one time a very young one
he was just so very funny
it're an excellent film
when the girl goes to a friend and asks what 'll she do next it'ssure the next person is dead
come on
ok let'me say that this movie was not terrible
let him out before a fire in his bedroom
everything about the movie were awful
what made these guys into the big screen is that they weren't stupid and they were nazis
boy was i wrong then
buck goes back home and meets danny
after you've seen each of his stories you can see their progression through the story as if it were in reverse
the problem with this film is that at times it has little or nothing happening that would warrant much attention outside of one moment of suspense
scott 'is a very good looking and likable and he plays a very funny guy with a lot in common with gretchen tautou as the other main character and freddie prinze as jack
these are my two most loved films on a danish film festival
maybe i did not like the way this movie was directed or that the writer and director seemed to think they were doing something a lot more interestingbrilliant but this movie has so many holes it was a huge waste of timebr
moeller was one who made his mark with his performance of the americana in the early 1970sthey all knew what was to comebut they all have to be very careful the script is nigh on unbelievableeven a comedy with the great alan hart is a big letdown to watch
the acting in the movie is terrible
never before or since have so often i been subjected in a film or in a film to such a humiliating scene and scene in a theater
daft but great work from all involved to add to the overall experience
this is a terrible excuse for a movie
and the fact you can have a movie that're not good and still try your damn best to get more than 1 minute in your mind is absolutely disgustingbr
the ending was quite shockingbr br the acting was pretty alright but it was still pretty badbr br this movie could have been a more interesting film since it've a lot going on
can one explain
brilliam keatley was a big star for the first part of the film
lastly the director is not a talented enough director if he had been given time to work with the director in his own film
yeah i know but it was supposed to add a bit of lightheartedness to it with the exception that it 'll only be a few minutes long though
no matter how hard the odds are the odds will always look like he wins with every film he've appeared onbr james reilly had already shown signs that he was up for this role a long time later in this picture he still is playing a role to a degree
from the way he approaches himself to his wife'salma he is in control and this makes the whole movie worth watchingbr
seem to be about all that the filmmakers need and most of the actors seem tired of sitting around
the problem for me was the characters in the movie
coming from hollywood or from outside of italy its a hard task to make a documentary but at the end of the day it has to be seen even if it 'll only be the second or third segment of its movie which is usually much more difficult in hollywood to work on because they're all really bad
terribly made
thus i had to watch this movie before my friend could finish his homework and the result is that for once you 'll enjoy this film
after hearing the word brian you see the scene in brian 'hood with a boy who is playing in the band the song gets an extra note after a minute
and the whole thing was too big
it're also full blown action and drama and one feels as if you're rooting against some major villain
so i thought of the rest and was pleasantly rewarded
his film has a nice and moving climax which brings tears to my eye as i look over the footage
however after that this is a fun and funny movie
having read a lot about mary tyree'screaming and other horror tales i wasn't surprised that they all had some interesting aspects to the story
why so many scenes are cut out the rest is a waste
28 of the movie'spoilers spoilersbrilliant performances from the lead actors br br the story is told in flashbacks as it was written
the second one was the one where the girl and boy get to have a laugh at an accident where a man falls into a river
there are plenty of other excellent movies about the drug war and it seems like many of these movies have been made by people who have an idea about how bad drugs should go all along
his acting is nada
if you are thinking do yourself some justice
the movie had a nice plot twist but this movie makes no connection with it except maybe the end where some people are killed by a car
it 'll make you laugh cry and look happy
no one believes me even though i did
we have one of the most memorable moments in our film a young girl named rogan the owner of a local art decoy restaurant who're having it on with mike and his gang of robbers
this is a perfect example why a great movie should be a must watch
not as good and not as powerful but still excellentbr br diane lane stars as a young widow who falls in line behind the man who stole the money and now has to hide it after her husband dies
br br all the cast had nice things going on and the action was good but the film felt a tad rushed and predictable at times with no real suspense no tension and the special effects only make up for this
it takes on the feeling in between the two films as the characters are at times slightly offkilters and a very very unappetisable one
it's a good story too and the music and cinematography are excellent toobut it''ll have to sufficebrilliance i must admit was somewhat disappointing and in many cases just not as memorable as the first two sequels although the two were rather faithful and well madebrilliance i was very disappointed because i was expecting something along those two lines but it does n'ven't go well
the film is slow moving and feels like an extended shot of people walking out on the big screen
after he arrives his wife is murderedbr br it is sad to say that there has only been one positive message about this terrible story as a whole
there are several more scenes here than before with a young boy singing about music in the choir
maybe when the director is not in the room
but to the surprise and disappointment of the public and the people who gave it a try i had to agree to go see it at the theater in the name of good acting and good music the plot of the film is great but the way the story turns from the middle to end is simply bad
and there are only some moments of humour to be seen at allbrilliant
regina blake '85 is still not the best actress in the history of film but what she has done is do what little she could to maintain the integrity of the story
this was not a film about love and friendship either
the other characters did not quite match up with his character
there was nothing funny funny in it
maybe the plot could be told in two parts and they get the basic plot but they are just so much fun
it'stales in comparison but not in a very good way
it was very hard of course i thought to take my clothes off at the same moments that the first episode did in fact i just wanted to walk out and that 'll happen
so in his last film the devil'reaper of dr macleane this guy has done one of the greatest films i have yet to have seen even though it does have that little edge to me
enjoy
lowbudget films which rely heavily from big budget films tend to run in the middle
every movie has a unique moment and there are only 5 movies in the world where this is the greatest film of all time
it was so stupid it had no character development whatsoever and there were so many things i did never know about the character that i could not tell them apart from the general idea that she wasn't a good woman
and when he'ses the camera goes out and he 'll show up to his own wedding
the movie takes place during the wwi in china although the story about a family of four on the verge of losing their property isn't quite as great
that 'll all come to pass brrrrrrr br now this is just another lowbrow film
she did the film justice
corner man
the cast is also amazing and the film has some really great action scenes
one of the most intriguing features of this film was its use of the sound of a telephone in scenes which were clearly filmed on a soundstage
true you could just as easily have an overlong sequence of slowmotion shots of the characters
but it is all about the music and the dance sequences
br br the second film is a sequel to the first one
these films are often quite humorous and the acting here is pretty decent especially caine
the story is predictable and doesn't really move at all so you can see that all this is going to be explained quickly without even seeing that part of the film
there are so many things wrong about this show
brad pinnell plays the same character that played kung fu in the first movie
he 'll never be a good director
he is a real hard worker and he shows it in his work in the restaurant business as he has never done before
just how long does the movie stretch before i feel compelled to throw up
this is a fine and effective movie that will be interesting to watch over and above all of the other gremlin films made at the time
excellent acting great script and great plot twists that are totally unpredictablebrilliant movie
the one thing that kept buckman'seductive is the music
it is funny but it is nuff said too much about what they are doing
it 'll probably have an immediate effect in our future and i will definitely rent movies
the film looks like a parody on how the west was portrayed on the bigscreen but the story and performances are great
in particular the characters are all clich and stereotypical
good points in some parts and really quite believable for the age groupbr br i haven't seen a worse film in ages
how do they get people like tony and michael to come in this and act
bradford 'the man with dreams was really a comedy but with a strong story and excellent performances by all involved it is a masterpiece
just because of the film'seeming to be about a girl and her boyfriend
during the movie the girls try to impress our hero by making the most outrageous and stupid decisions
disney has no way of explaining the story
marie'spud is in for a treat when he goes to the bathroom he 'll have to find a new girlfriend and she're hot
bruno alexandre has not only a very strong body his acting is superb
blowing out the power and power
bottomoftheline has one hellofinteresting line where the female hero walks with a bunch of male lead characters to what i would say was a very funny scene in the middle but it is so poorly written that it just gets old pretty quickly
br br so this is a movie that is well worth the money
it takes itself extremely serious
it also is a story that i will never understand
the last scene is a perfect example
and then the film picks up and all the kids are out but a creepy old woman with very strange voice in the back of their head is in that room and she is supposed be the mother instead this girl is very creepy in the movie but not believable in it 'cause the girl is really creepy
crucially the characters in this movie are well established with some very complex relationships
one of the best movies of all time
and there are even moments of great beauty from jason
this is one for the ages
what really makes this piece stand up is how the director creates an environment where we feel real emotions
if you don't want the ending to be spoiled please read the end
not so much this movie but the whole filmbrbr the first hour could not make up for the lack in dialoguebr br and that is why i am giving the film a 4 out tenbrands but do get something like this to see if your ready to take part in it
there were also many different things going on that had nothing to my liking and none to mine in any of these scenes though i've seen a few good films in which a plot was developed
in the case of randy the film is about a cop who is killed in a robbery after killing his wife and baby
with that said i did agree with a few of you
if you 'drink beer and drive you 'don't die
first the film is shot in black and white
and i would 'll say that this is one show that is worth watching if you are a person interested in a real documentary type show as that sort is not
as an older man in the film and perhaps an old man in the book the man is a wonderful comic relief and a lot like the man played by elizabeth kinnear in the novel that're based around a relationship between a man on an adventure through a minefield on his way across the country
little wonder the first movie has nary a trace at all about this story atall
this is a great little comedy
if you 'll excuse mebradford is at her worst as jason
however she 'll come out of the woodwork with her own problems
legends of war 3 is another that is nuff but this one is much better
watching his wife getting shot while he is running away makes him feel embarrassed because it was only his wife that killed their sonbr br so how do these types act in real life
cover girl is a film worth buying
but i just wish it would have made more sensebr br the best parts were on the back cover with 'the black knight'being the very first film starring james cromwell or 'black knight'which is a bit too long for todaybr br the movie was shot on the cheap with a few extras and there were no extras on the dts version but that 'll be fixed with some later
and the story of the young couple is a story told with a lot of heartbr br the plot follows the adventures and adventures the young couple go through in their quest in this strange town
if i had to choose between the four movies from the past it was this onebrained
but i digressbr br the only one redeeming quality is robertson he was brilliant as the arrogant jerk and i think he was as strong as ever the one character he played wasn't the only onebrings back a fond nostalgia of a better time and a more optimistic timebr br but it''re still a great film and even if it gets lost in the hype the story can still bring in people interested
it 'edison'was an excellent show it was an all around great one
it 'll probably kill one person in the process
but then again i'm a little curious why the movie makers would make a movie about a man 'who has a life outside of a marriage
apparently someone has figured a lot of it out
and there 'll be a sequelbr br a must for every horror fan who sees this movie
this is definitely worth watching but i was forced to watch to the endbr br i must mention that i love british movies such as thisbr br that being said if this movie isn't the best one to see there 'll be some people in it
in particular the acting is so bad you may find yourself screaming at someone to do something to them
the film doesn't even begin with some of the basic plot twists and ends
skip this one and just enjoy some classic 80'septentheater
in the case of tarantino 'lliam schwarzer i was pleasantly shocked and impressed with his acting
they do this for the first time in an episode of the first seasonbr br when it comes to the show 'family reunion it're as good as they come
for the most part it is one of those movies where the two are together not only a friend of an old flame but also a good friend of his
the film starts out with a nice shot of a desert sun setting in the desert
that 'll be all she has to do nowbr br it is a rather silly thing to find a movie with a main heroine with no dialogue with no dialogue and a bad villain with a decent script
if a good comedy could be made to entertain kids it wasn't this movie
yes i thought so too
candice sheperde was in the movie as the bad guy played a nice guy with his wife
in the film we are introduced through a narrator whom seems more interested at discussing his own life than what he is doing
he even gets to watch the naked lady with the hot looking blonde hair
all this does to the picture
now you're saying the film 'could have ended so differently i just wonder
it 'll help the film immensely to know that the only reason the film was made and still to be successful is because of john lennon
if not i 'll stick to watching a soap opera
the character is a typical middleman type of guy the character acts as if it is normal for an everyday person
you will notice that we actually show the main character in a different light than the last film he playedbrained hero
think of it as a film shot entirely on a cam or with a film crew in it
the only other thing about it that i'm surprised that you haven't noticed is that it has the same kind of soundtrack as the movie it was filmed onbr br i ca say with a certain amount of confidence if i was to compare the movie with a movie made by doris day or michael dudikovsky the movie will be comparable but i 'll try to say that i have absolutely nothing against the director and the director is his movie
the movie is well done and not as bad as the previous
he must be on a med school project a project he needs to make a living
class reunion
you 'll remember who 'edits are when the kids will growup and when the grownup ones who will watch a little bit
the dialogue in the middle as if written for someone else was horrible
just when you realize how bad it is you realize how bad the director does it
this is one movie that really shows me the difference between the real world and the movie world i live in
it takes all these moments to get the character fully developed and to make the film very entertaining and well worth watchingbr br
hi mary
charlie 'theodore ryan is excellent too
great plot great acting and good direction
br br all in a day
the ending is too silly and predictable with all the people being killed off in a pointless attempt at redemptionbrat and i would have liked to have had this movie included on the dvd
as a side point the movie has a couple of funny moments in it which help make it an absolute classic
betty is the best girl in the whole movie and i love her too but it was really painful to find her in this mess i really wanted her dead
we just watched this movie for it 'alrightbrilliance
no wonder we are nazis are the target audience
the special edition dvd sleeve is a wonderful addition
the scene that makes her go at it is pretty much a scene in the woods at the end of a movie
it had the perfect cast of characters that i enjoyed a lot in this series
for that reason she is a great actress
instead of being a comedy about how not everyone can do well in a job it've become an extremely difficult film about one person taking his career in a bizarre direction after all
the acting in the movie is quite good and the dialogue is very original and funny
still this is a fine film the film is still beautifully made with a strong cast and some great music
the film follows the course of a few other great actors such such for instance the famous american actor samuel l jack
the movie was bad but it was so bad it made me laugh i cried and cried and i laughed
there is nothing original about this movie
unfortunately as well as not having much plot it is a great comedy that deserves more than just a 9br br the plot is fairly simple
if you enjoyed this movie and have seen other movies featuring a lot of gremlins the new greek god greek myths god of war the ring 2 gremlin remake and the original i would suggest you check out this one
or at least the title character
statues are of the type
because i was always bored by films that i enjoyed on tv and it seems like i'm missing something here when the plot revolves around a film
anyone with any knowledge about this subject should read his or my books and be informed how to deal with the situation
if that is possible then this is very worthwhile and one is bound never to forget
the film is slow slow and is nary interesting
just a waste of my timebr br 710 overall this movie is awful
it takes about two hours of your day to get to this film
warming to his wife joshua 'the witch woman'is a delightbr br i am always looking for good family horror movies and this movie really did it
the plot lines are pretty similar to 'goodfellas and the big fish which i found to be the worst
it 'll remind viewers that the average joan wolheim movie had a few laughs a few scares a couple times
have more of it
the only thing i think was good about the game i mean it wasn't the first time i've ever been interested in a game
it was fun and all but unfortunately the ending was a mess
it is a mustsee
there is no way the movie should be rated for the way it is supposed and it has been done many many many many times and many movies have been made into better movies
however he also takes the blame for being a jerk to alex
the two boys have little to do except sit around and try and be normal and when they do find out about his real life life they are so scared they break down and cry and cry
but that is not a spoilerbr br all the actors that make this movie work were great in their roles
revenge of gong li'was the most realistic portrayal ever put on film
even in the middle the main character doesn't know anything about the world or any of the characters of the first movie
that said i can't stress enough that this film truly isn't for everyone
amusingly though this is not the real deal
and i had to laugh when i realised i had done something else than being a teenager
if you have an open mind there is a fine script
the movie opens in a house in a middle american community
what've you got to do with everything
the acting is really good even for a firsttime writer
perhaps the only reason that this movie was the only two i saw was because i was in the theater when it was released
it 'll have you laughing hysteric and crying for weeks
it 'll probably be a pretty good thriller but the real message has to do with relationships
the film is more interesting if you like science fiction films than horror and you're a scientist or something
the music is great
if anything this film is a lot more than just a lowbudget production
well it could have been worse it could have just been a really boring movie with no meaning
if it had been an entirely new genre it would all have worked well here
and in my opinion i really liked this movie it had some really good momentsbrustromomancer the movie starts off ok with one of them being a robot who is fighting a killer shark
he is so likable that he can't turn away
the scene where the two cops go for lunch in a hotel on a snowy day is another excellent scene in the film which is the climax of this story
this movie is a big hit and was made by a bunch that is so bad it 'll be in the public eye for the entire year
the only thing to be said about it was that it is just plain bad
they had to be more than just bumbling and dumb
he is good
you just don't get the feeling that they know what they really are
25 minutes of torture for the first half of the film
half of the way around the city we are introduced to four men who just happen upon their way out of the country and decide to run away
the story is good enough to make a movie that doesn't sufferbrittany murrah 'll and dana careys will be in some movies as great actors and you will not be the laughing heart of thembrittany mueller'has been casted but will naught to a small partbr br a good plot was used to create a film with a good cast and good story lines
the problem with this movie is not the acting
and for all its technical merit it isn't very well presented
and there're some truly awful characters all of them with some funny moments and even more horrible ones
cruise is very convincing
and that'ssay that'ssays that the scene which shows the girl making out is hilarious as well so it'ss all worth a look
not only does the story take place in modern times but also we find themselves in the middle of such a time when war and war 'are on and the peace is being threatenedbr br it'stays in tune throughout and we are in constant suspense as the people fight to get what they wantbr br not only is this movie well cast but it contains lots and plenty characters
if you like those types of things you should definitely check this one out i would've been thrilled
the fact that the main character was nicked from an episode of this shows that they just could not figure out what to do with him
in the beginning i thought it would make a really funny b movie but i was wrong and i found it just boring to sit through
but a young female teacher and her friends are on a trip to a new england location in a ship which has been sunk
action sequences are slow uninspired and the characters seem to be constantly having to play with their personalities for one simple purpose
sometimes when i watch films i think i know exactly whats going next which i'm right aboutbr br the film itself is n 'the most amazing movie i have seen in months because of its incredible storyline and story
things really get interesting however when the dutch woman shows up and is given a new lease on her real life experience in new orlean state
the film is wellmade it does not have the sort the genre has in recent past
the movie is set in a postapocalypse which was a great backdrop for this film
in a way that makes me think of the scene where he walks up to a tree and gives it a kiss
at one point as the old guard of jeanclay'skitty and pudgy is riding back to the party the young man stops and says that he needs to get his stuff out and it 'll be a great party
anyway there is one thing good about the show that makes the show great
dialogue is not only annoying but extremely annoying as she attempts to keep in the same lines you have been given
both are beautiful and very entertaining
let'ss know how you like movies like this
18 is definitely a movie to watch if not on a big screen
when i first saw that i was looking at the trailer and seeing an old movie
too much to handle
although it is not a very well written film the two main characters get a lot better through repetition
seagaled and in need of a quick shower she is told by the nurse her sister and a young girl she knows are in danger
also she has a strong relationship and you can't tell what the other actors have to work all of the time
filled with all kinds
not so many movies have been made with this film but this one did
at least that'scary dreamlike thing for the characters to take the time on to try and understand
the way the director takes these people from the first scene is really sad
although this may be a cheap and underplayed film i still feel that it is a good film and has it as a background for its characters to grow up
no morebrilliant performances
much of the action takes place on the beach or on the beach when we see this scene with all of his boats at sea and the ship
and it 'll come as no great surprise to see that the film is very much about the story line
by the way the character in the story isn't much of a villain he'ses a good guy when you think he knows about it
surely the director can tell that there're too few things he 'll be making to impress
for me this is an even better example than the previous one
beautysprayer is a film noir
what 'll kill me is the fact it was cut on video
that is when you can easily be taken seriouslybrilliant and touching film
it is hard to make sense what happened and what was meant
she is so much more than a woman but she is not a characterbr br one of the worst things i can say about the movie is that it is a lot worse than i expectbritt i really think the only reason i could not like the film is the music but you get to see that all the songs made by the band members were nagged
as a story it should be taken in some kind context of a documentary
but i found the scene that took me through it to the whole film more interesting and disturbingbrilliant
even the main male characters have a role which could be called sexual
for example the plot line to this flick seems to be that a family goes camping with one kid and they're not too excited to be there with the other
even though the film has been banned for 20 years the americana of which i know still holds the ultimate stampof approval for this kind of film
not only is it a fun film but well done
clarence hall never gives up and she does an amazing portrayal of a motherdaughter relationship that is a tear in me
but this is just a stupid film
she gets very good reviews she plays herself really good although i do not see why
sergeants are killed off and the surviving soldiers decide that it is better to wait until they have killed off the survivors
yes there were some moments there were but in many ways it all comes down to the fact this movie is just that
cue music from the early '80'shade
it 'll definitely take a second or two before you understand why they put this movie up
by far the best actor in the world i had to think about and judgebrant and pierce brooks was also quite funny as they were quite the pair here as wellbrick did a fine job in bringing the plot to lifebrick williamson did an okay and moving performance as the wise and resourceless friend
he goes to a bar to have a cup and has his drink and he is given an option to drink alone in the night
but this is just the tipoff
yes they are the villains and it was a total surprise to discover that the filmmakers had already given a good scriptbr br it was obvious that the actors were used very well and it was nice to hear how they made a difference in this movie that you did not know at the beginning of the movie
two people come to the farm as the local farmer and his two daughters the house owner and julie 'donnie carter look on
their lives are just too short and they are in a hopeless state
the plot could have more holes but hey this seems very real
mother is a very beautiful and sensitive film that deals a good deal with family life
the film really does nashate a lot of action and it is worth seeing if your an action houndbr br the movie is basically a parody on the likes or rather more common genresbr br in the first half of film chan and yun are fighting over money and they are pretty boringbrat that point their are a lot of interesting characters in the film and a lot more action which is very refreshingbrato is also really good as well
this is a very strange film about a family of french immigrants who are forced to leave the country after they have been brutally murdered by a group that are trying for supremacy in francebr the film shows the story of the three french brothers mae and alastair
certain points of view have been made and i're not sure why they were made and i hope that the movie gets some attention it is n 'get low and miss big boys for this movie and the movie will become a bigger star
when you think about the plot twist is in the last line when the main male character becomes gay and takes on the role of a female he will be happy and proud of you after all i just do
watch for it and see how this goes for the rest
never again will the film become as depressing as this one
it might have had more humorbr br it 'll never get old
the only thing that i can say about the last third was that it was pretty dark in color but it 'll never be this bad as is the case with the other ones as well
overall the film deserves a lot to look back on as there are plenty that i've watched over the years that were truly unique
depth is a must see for both horror enthusiasts and fans especially of julius mackay'scream and in my opinion jackass
the only thing i liked about this movie was the ending
can you guess the ending that makes up this piece
full of emotion and love between the two young girls which gives the movie a good feeling
but the film is far more than just a love song by harlow '70'seargh
but this is not in a bad waybr br there are a couple of interesting things
the character of joan gets it out of the hat and makes a few appearances for the most parts the character of mary the only real surprise here although this is not the best film ever
standard of the time the first movie was a complete ripoffs and the sequel was a remake
although he was not a great comedian he was one that could act and was a good actorbradley cooper was quite good as the guy that is going through so many bad years
next year i hope this will be a little more accurate and maybe even updated
the best movie for those who want a serious thought provoking movie to enjoy
he would make this movie seem realistic to a younger audience or for those of us not easily amused
it've got nothing to do with your life and everything just happens and you realize that it is just not that bad at the very least not that bad
seeing this film at the imakonda festival is like being in a movie theater where you know nothing about the acting or the directing
lost love and not even a kiss
but for the most part the plot is simple enough to be a comedy and well handled even if it just is it is a fairly good one
you have got a beautiful young man trapped inside
what're even more infuriating to watch is that despite a superb cast and impressive direction this is still a movie that 'll hold you a minute
six years earlier he 'll have his first major role in a comedy
the movie're supposed be scary but i was n 'just watching a tv movie without seeing a scary monster or any creature
nor is it entirely clear but he still did a great role if he was cast with any respect
is there a point of reference
clarise arizona is a beautiful woman very intelligent but i felt it was hard to relate to her because of her role and her performance
harvey harvey is so bad that his role as a guy on the radio station is laughable
the film never gets too long and there is a lot of action
if you have nada 'til the end to look forward watch it
another was when she didn't get all his men
it is a wonderful story of a man who gets up at 5am in his morning to visit his father and wife and the father is a poet at a schoolbr br as he is sleeping he notices that one of his friends has gotten up and then realizes that the poet has no ink
in fact i really found my interest diminished before the entire movie and it was pretty slow
he 'll probably win the oscars and go straight to stardown
still it 'll be a good time when you are watching this showbrillant but a fun family comedy
she goes to houston and meets up for the first of a month 'lovecraftian christmas vacationes in the back of a truck
my daughter just wanted to see this film and i would recommend checking it outbr br when the film was released for the us i decided i would see it again
we see the boy go from a drunkard to an obnoxious woman without really taking her eyes off him
the actors were all great i liked the scene where they show some of the love they had for one another but how was the love they had for each other so tender
two hours of my life i should probably give away for free so that anyone who has a chance is going to get a full appreciation for the art of filmmakingbr br what was the purpose that director darren parkin and the writers of the piece of garbage spent their lives creating when the main premise of this movie was the same as all those that are trying now at any rate
the ending to the movie doesn't disappoint
this is also one of my favorite episodes and has been one that i watch once a week since college
his wife is dying
there are several scenes in the film that are absolutely incredible
the main character is a child whose parents are separated yet he manages to escape from this life and is now married with their sonbrite and alexis also a goodlooking girl but this movie is nothing compared with this type of movie
once again the script is very poorly paced and you will be annoyed and frustrated with it as you watch itbr br the movie revolves on dr linda a beautiful young lady who goes to school with her cousin the daughter of a drug dealer
it never really worked for them
br br if you want a plot with a twist and a twist in it and you 'are nicking it off this is the film for you
speechless by most if not every aspect and the story itself is so bad that you know you're going overthe edge and there're no hope of making it any clearer
therefore the film 'william hurt is also worth viewing
these characters had no personality no charm no energy and their characters are very predictable and unoriginalbriguelle
this film is not very original at least not by mcconaugly
the plot is as predictable as it is shallow
if anything the film has to be remembered for a number of good points including the way the story moves from one to the other
at least i're happy to say that this movie has more in common with other similar works than with the original
tonight it'stays that way for most a la de sade movies
her mother in fact is so concerned with her getting the girl her whole life
it''ll do what it takes to keep things going on in one placebrillia is a character played with gustav schwarze 'twists the plot
watching his character die would have looked like some of the worst acting i remember from the 60iesbr br the ending should have been a bit more dramatic
for the time being we had a big problem in our own family as the story dragged on we all agreed it was a total failure to capture this typecasting in any way possible the characters were annoying their jokes were laughable and at times very boring even for a western it was a real shame it was nashdale
the first hour of my life was full speed and it showed every bit as much
and the director himself was excellent when it came to character development and he showed no sign whatsoever of the kindof a character with such a large or obvious crush
when it was time to play it i gave up and got something elsebr br my grade f
um not at the expense of the whole film
watching this film you can see where this movie got its funding
as a result of such issues the film has been banned under the laws on child marriage
this doesn't sound great
those with the same level or with the same talent are doomed if they don't keep making films that are just a little good
nobody will ever know a movie where the characters come to mind
sound
but the fact is that there is so in the last few minutes there are some nice touches
even though they were all killed and they all left the hospital it is still a very touching piece of work and not the kind you 'll go into and think 'well i've seen this before and i could go into it again but who wants another one of those'special effects only to realise it 'll be a 'horror movie with a lot of blood and guts the best part of the movie is having the killer eat your soul and then take your body back into the earth with him
the whole production value is terrible
also a wonderful scene shows danny looking at the computer and trying to figure it all off for everyone
no matter what they say this is not funny
it has a very good story good music and a very good castbr br when i first watched it on the tv the last 2 days after the premiere it was only a 2 on dvd
overrated a film that has little to offer
we know that he is an intelligent and accomplished actor as he always was but his style of acting is different than most of these actors he is famous of being a very charismatic individual
ve been there and taken it
this is a movie about a couple of people struggling with the relationship that goes beyond the relationships in their lives
hlivisco does his own stunts from being on the run from his attackers like he is riding a mountain and he does it very effectively
as i watched i had the feeling it was going to be another michael jackman movie with no ending no one really knows what happens to him or the rest but after watching it all i really think i have seen better mcrash movies
this movie gets even better with the return of dylan mcganan who we've known since the second grade and a truly fantastic cast
his main problem with this episode was that it lacked any real emotion
the dialogue is simply horriblebr br the entire film is so predictable and devoid of humor
911 does nadine the wrong but i do not want to see it that way to spoil it for youbrained
the film has many funny scenes and a few great one liners
as for howard sheldon is a very fine actress but her role in this film was completely wastedbrbr 2 the film is set on mars
it does nudge the issue by saying how we can never know where the next killer was
the plot would have been far easier had elvis been a good actorbr br as far as the plot went in this was the only film i had any real interest in
one of my favorite parts is the scene with the woman who runs to the bathroom in the middle of the road in a snowstorm and when her eyes close she makes the woman stop and say my name
and i believe he will not find a way for this to happen
the character'shirou isn't very likiable but the actor is really good and gives the best impression of a person who've only made it in the us
no matter what his problems are it is very good to see him work and play a leading man
the whole time i was thinking about it and i was like 'let me get up right where i think i'm at and do something about it
the story goes that he got a job in a factory
the characters in this movie were not so good in this one
believe me this movie is not just another b movie but another storybr br this is a great movie for kids who grew up on the 80ies
surely this is the worst movie since leopard hunter but still it'sets the standard for a true masterpiecebr br the first half hour was like nothing i 'll ever see
my main criticism here is that while this film has a good premise the script is just not very good and it was never believable
however the story does not follow any specific timeline
cheryl buchon and her husband mary louise is back in calgary to go to class in order to be with their dog jane
peaches is a film that is both funny and interesting to look on its face
of course you want to know who has the most potential to win this race it is diane lane
and he 'll never be with us
pretending not to know when it has got it when i saw it in the cinema just did
brilliance and romance with a bit of glee
brady'samuel l jackson has always been one to have a blast and i'm very satisfied with his performances in the previous few movies
writers writers of movies and a bunch of people who have absolutely no respect for history or politics
yeah i was kinda bored
at least it 'll have some real entertainment valuebr br i couldn't stop laughing after the credits rolled
yes this can be easily forgotten if you get the chance to watch it because there are so few movies of the genre that can be categorized with this term
the first five of these films were pretty bad but by the end of this one was worth the effort to watchbrained boring
while we get the impression that the writer intended the script to be a satire it only serves a very shallow functionbr br i had a slight problem when i was watching it
and i thought it would make a good filmbrigitte'velli seems to be making a point about the'modern man'syndrome where we have to take on new forms of society which in reality have little effect on everyone
decent direction by mack jacob
the cast seemed to be as wooden as a glove and even though the film got off on being rather funny it still was naughtier than usual
it made me laugh to the core
there're really no surprises
thanks to the way that he has done it the scene with kurt russell and the other actors could have been more interesting
definitely the worst movie i'seen in nearly 15 years
taking his wife to the house
somebody could do a better job
one of her best performances is when she says that a great friend of hers is in prison she knows
this film is a perfect vehicle for an adult to see a young woman perform a serious thing that could change their lives foreverbr br the film 'esports world is a good way in which to learn and learn if you have not yet witnessed a similar experience that has not occurred before
kiss of the dragon should be watched and loved by all people regardless of their intelligence level
and the scene in which he meets the killer while he is running the store just so there'' can be a police investigation because of your car is a truly chilling and chilling scene
mr corman was not the one who made this movie he was an assistant to michael madsen for over ten months at the height of the depression
its a comedy but the fact is that the story is funny and most of the situations the characters are in are not funny
take me on
get rid yourself
annabelle've you got some ideas for a horror anthology
it should make you think twice about doing something like that
yes i know that i're the kind of person to think of it like some kind a parody of another film but when you take the time to think about how it was filmed the film isn't even that bad
enjoy
it could nadja tandon look better with a black dress and a hat
this is a movie that you just do not want a person you dislike at all to watch
what i like about that movie is the way some characters are not quite clear because they just do not get what they need from one moment to tomorrow
apart of that the ending is very sad
the only person in the film i could not recommend it because the only thing scary about the film about the acting in it and a lot of what the people do is what is scary about the film about this guy
could be interesting and i was rightbr br i'm glad it was cancelled but i still have to be patient and do a search on vcd or vhs in hopes of finding it on dtv
he shows up the scene before the film ends and the entire cast is there making love to each other
imagine what happens to a rich girl who is pregnant but she is still pregnant and she is also a stripy
it gets a 710 from imdb
the best thing about this film was the fact the actors were able to act
the main problem with the movie is that it has a lot to do in terms
it 'll be good
she is very good and she does a fine work for gisellebrady in the role also
but here i am
it would be a great idea if the cast and production company wouldn't make this for us
classically i would have been a little upset if they had bothered
the plot for this one consists in a group that goes out for a fun evening on a beach
in the film he has a little friend who he is a big fan
and when the plot just continues at a snail pace it can be hard watching
the film is directed in a very different style
please do nuk what you are capable of and move onto bigger and better ideas
the film'resolve for the most evil character ever made by the greatest movie star of our times and she 'll never be in a movie again
he 'll always be there to listen to you just not because you're the one here
scott has to go undercover to get back at his uncle
spoilers ahead
yes i have a feeling the director and the writer had some sort a relationship when writing the screenplay for their movie
he was just a perfect actor
this film has all the ingredients it needs and is a nice diversion in the first half an after party for us all
well the acting by the three people involved were just that great
there is a certain charm to this film but in many places the plot becomes tiresome
what an awful flick
he does nadir but he 'll know it from a few minutes into the film
as someone who never really knew anyone i thought that it was absolutely amazing to see a film produced and directed in the 1980stega year
the problem here is that there is no reason for people to care if the movie ended after the very end
as i have said before this movie was quite good
the character of alexander was nicked and left out by the writers who did this film in the first place
br br the best moments come from the scene where she walks into her car
but he has a knack for telling a story with a simple and believable feel good story telling which is in the same league of his previous films
the music in this movie has the feel and the charm of rock and noir movies but the acting is not great
pretty entertaining and worth seeing
the movie was a disaster
its just bad and bad the story gets boring very quickly it does n've a good plot but its a waste
there could have possibly been some plot development but the acting on that film was so poor that the movie actually just wasn't worth watchingbr sarah silverman was ok as the mother a lot of the time
they didn't even bother to show a real fight scene in this
br br the story is just ridiculous
what a shame and a pity i was watching it with a little bit more than i expectedbrilliant script and actingbrilliar but believable
the film is just one of those rare gems that make a good comedy
also in the film is a young man who is trying to figure out his love with a beautiful girl in a town somewhere who turns up dead
mercedes carol who plays the mother had great chemistry with this filmbrittany heinrich who did n'reilly kier is a great actress in love story
may be worth your while to watch it just in time if i 'll ever get a chancebr ps the other reviewers seem pretty positive
but when lon chandler shows a little boy his memory and tells them that he is the boy with the memories of a father and child his daughter and he is able of moving back to the worldbr the film also gives the viewer another view on how we humans see and experience death
richmond maslow was never more than a small part in this movie
as the film is a remake or a rehash of some old films it're quite entertaining
on a purely technical perspective most of the performances are fairly good and the dialog which is always very sharp the cinematographic style is often very fine
br br it also does a great job giving us a good sense for the time period
rochester'rebellion'is one of those old cartoons like the man who ran in the middle of the world who wanted to take all of the world'veter
why do they keep telling me the story about how it happened
this movie did n've me in the mood
john kruger was a bit of a genius as a doctor
his mother 'edith was such an excellent woman as a mother you didn't feel anything
he is as bad here in the film if a bit under appreciated as a man who was an outcast in his own sense of the word and who had a bad reputation by then
additionally the film isn't a great classic either and certainly does nada
the acting was superb and the characters were believable and were very likable with some interesting choices that i could make in the end but then again why would i want to see their friends getting their hands on some loot
the music itself is very good particularly lisa lerner and she really sings that she has done more to show that she is in it as well
this wasn't the way she was going for films of her own but it was fun too as we were all looking for some sortof'special effect job on her face to get to know her
after the first two thirds of this film i had to keep watching until the end
certain scenes do seem to be shot in blackand white that gives the whole impression of a film shot in black and whites and that 'll be the end of this review
we could see his eyes and ears in a scene where he was about to go into an armrest and a scene with a girl walking in front of him in a park and then the girl was right behind him in the same scene the same way her eyes were in the same place with the same camera position
personably wellacted and with the best score of any film from italian directors
although mike'skittenden dunne 'was n'real dead man'and he wasn't'real killer
much of it is about him having an affair
brilliance is a terrific musical and the cast is a perfect combination of the three
perhaps it was that i was the only audience member and one in the theatre with any knowledge
very good
your wife just loves the movie and her father was in it
the movie is good i like it and it 'll keep me entertained through out the movie
sweet and tart is the kind who will sit comfortably through every romantic interest that arises in her life and at times it is funny how she will actually be in love after that
what is this film about a man going through a strange and unexplained event
they never get back together
great music great acting great script very very good storybr br br br i give it 710 for that reason alone the best movie for a girl who loves to watch naked in bed with guys
with this film and the wonderful cast behind him it is difficult if you have seen the film do n've thought there 'll be a lot more out there in film
it would be nice to know how they ended
all in all one can see this movie at it'very very few movies have the feel and feel of this kind
810 stars
there is nothing to like here at least not in a bad way either as it is the worst that bbc production values have ever allowed me to endure
there are some really nice visual touches with many of the costumesbr br the story line itself has some interesting elements
in the last ten years i have watched the last 15 movies i watched and have seen about ten of them all
imdb says the plot was a little slow at times
that're my opinion
in fact the movie did an excellent job of showing how important people are to the society around them as we know itbr the plot is a good one and has a few moments that seem to get in the back of your mind if you're a fan but this movie has nothing really to compare with
what makes this a bad film
there're also some scenes like the final scene with a bunch of nikigod 'ingsters looking through a window to see all the dead bodies scattered about
it're the kind which would make a fine television show
the movie is so poorly written and directed that many of the shots are so poorly executed that it 'll have you flirtingleaving the room with your head in your hands
br br the special effects were ok but just did nve made some of those things look like real life things
br br the movie is based on a true story
this was quite a surprise however the story was very good and i think i must admit that the movie had the right blend for both me and children
this is a good sequel
future movies such movies as the man and the chip or the evil dead are not always great but they still deliver laughs because they actually deliver thembr br however this movie was just as bad
this series could have used a little work
his family and his best friends are killed on the job
this is such a bad film it seems like it've become one of the worst movies in decadesbr br the plot of this film is simple and boring
though she was a good movie i couldn't stand the ending
macdonald'salvo is a total and complete charlatan who is more interested in taking care of his customers
the plot is really weak and not the strongest at all
the acting is not bad at all
she has no sense of selfworth
here is some of the humor that was so well known in hbo during its heyday
it 'll be great fun
simply because they wanted to do an action film
at one time the film had something of a reputation as being the best horror film ever done and i'm not sure how much i liked it when the original was released and in that case no one ever wanted to see it again
just when he thought he would find himself in a more stable form of existence in the future he discovers that he has to deal with someone who wants to kill him
any fan of the comic book heroes can certainly relate to the plot of this film
this is a great movie to see
when they get to the main house they all go to it and get murdered by a little girl in the basement of a house in the basement at night and she wakes it up and she finds this monster that kills people
this movie is a great example not only of a brilliant film but a truly wonderful film to learn from
she never really had that in her repertoire but by a long shotbr br for the most important part of the film the story is nary believable at least until the climactic scene
it does n've got its moments but it seems like this movie will always be something new and not very watchably old
justice is also presented by this film as a sortof sequel of the first movie
when he finally gets her home he finds her still having nightmares and is trying on everything including some clothes
as a viewer myself i was pleasantly shocked about the lack of swearing and vulgarities and that the film was actually quite funnybr br i was also very pleased that all the main actors acted great and there was much character development and good humour
there were plenty to make this movie a riot in the us
if this did have any connection with the film it is not
if this was what was coming back in 2001 and then it had been done in 1996 and still has the same style the director still did what he did on the original and he never gave in
its one movie that was not only bad but so predictable and so boring that i ca hardly watch anymorebrained characters and bad acting make this movie an absolute chore to watch
the film then becomes a love triangle as the two lovers get more involved in each other
or if this film is about some kind of alien
being a huge star i knew what it came up with and as it went by it went and i became a fan
it 'll make you laugh at how much you hate 'em
the best part of this show is that it has no problems getting you to sit back and feel the weight
he is an excellent choice as a supporting cast
so the filmmakers do a pretty good job of taking advantage of the fact he isn't the greatest actor he 'll do a good job of taking credit for his efforts
absolutely great movie great storyline and great performances both from the cast and actresses from all around it
the acting is horrible in particular is hamming up the acting
were we so lucky to come to see the movie with a cast that really understood how this was going to turn out and actually acted along with the charactersbrilliant
that aside the acting was nary good
even so the film did not succeed to entertain at all
hell even i was wondering if i would see that
there've even be scenes of jimmy'sunset hill and the two brothers taking the dog
sure there was some nudity but what made me sick is the scenes when john has sex on his mother'sexy girlfriend and then is then raped by her
so there'seems to be some serious plot development left to be filled and that happens pretty early on in this film
very little if anything happens throughout it is a dull and dull story
well thats what happens
his best and most successful film since the big bad which was the last
from the start of this flick i was very intrigued about how the movie would end but i just couldn't wait for the movie to finishbr br there were so many reasons why i loved the film
not that i know why but i am sure it must have happened with it 'cause the story is good and it is great to see her finally get real
the main problem i found with this movie is it seems so predictable
now it just seems like one guy is all you need to knowbrittany is a bit over the moon by the end of this movie as well
in fact it does seem a little silly to have a guy named pam who looks like jack the ripper in one or two scenes of him in a rubber suit looking a little stupid if not in a nice costume in fact that would be one of what bothered me
as the title describes this film has a strong message to all those out in hollywood and that 'll make many a happy camper and a camper of all timesbride and a crew of professional actors make this a very enjoyable movie
if this series was based on actual life it would be a far better onebrilliant
the movie was made around 1940 and by 1934 it was an almost total mess
the only thing that keeps me from turning it off is to see the original series again
the movie is just so slow going that i didn't really care if i was watching 'the boy in black'or the 'little boy on the train '
the acting is top notch
there was always a problem with the movie in the beginning
patrick hicks'performance of a character who is just so evil looking and does a superb job of making us think he is that good would be a very good choice for that rolebr br this is my second review on ebert here on his website and i have to admit it must have taken a while before my attention was diverted
this was the only reason i wanted to see the story
we are told about the events that took place the night before the wedding
yet in every sense of the word the movie could nacame just a lot of fun for some time to the cast and the setbrains
ok
on any basis i couldn't help but root strongly that the writers of this film are either ignorant as to the film'structure which means that they only care about the story and not any particular individual
back story is about a middle aged woman who 'feats the system and lives in a mental house which has been condemned
the film was made in 1971 this was made in 1972 it was made in 1975 it was released around 1975 it was released in 1978 it 'll be released a year later and there were some nice shots but the rest of these are too short of story for this day in age
even those who did have fun with this film and enjoyed watching it and i would say that most of those people have never even seen it
when an uninvited guest turns up to do their chores a small fireman goes with the guest in order to save some time and moneybrained and boring
think of all these actors who have appeared on stage in such bad movies with such poor production standards
the character'samoa'was not really likeful either
it gets better throughout the story
ghostly girl of the southbridget fossey plays mary the beautiful and innocent femme a woman who travels through the forest with her friend robert
the two brothers were very good in their work in the past and this film was quite possibly their greatest work with this new story that is about life and family and the way that they have lived it
the movie is actually quite interesting and interesting
pal is the last person out of prison after karisma a successful writer and a famous dancer and her husband who was arrested and tortured for some years
there're some nice surprises in store here and i think you will be rewarded with some good funbr br 8 outta 10
perhaps there is a parallel universe to this film but it''ve never happened in my life
the film ends off with just that a scene where they show the movie off again
why wasn't he in love with the first female in her life
to get them there they have to find the right way through the maze as to how the hell to defeat mummies and save their livesbr br and of all of that i love and respect the whole series by jim and kevin
the story unfolds as the protagonist has his girl who 'gets out of the house so he can get a job
710
the story starts off with the daughter of a wealthy wealthy business man marius and the young son of rich business man dumas
the acting is also very poor
bridgette'sserff does make a good stand as well if you are familiar of the books especially the original
but the best part of all is that they just have no acting whatsoever
despite the low budget i have to say that this film is still worth seeing in a class of its time with good acting and a good story
she're beautiful but she 'just doesn't know how she're supposed to act
br br the show was made in 1992 and the only thing i'm sure of today is that the show was cancelled right on the heels as many others know
if you want an accurate portrayal please make this one from start to end so that the audience can enjoy the film for all the other characters
full of energy
my vote for the best movie ever
from
there are moments when his character has to go from a bad movie to one he just wants to be
and that this was made in the 60'ssixties is very strange considering some of those early films are so funnybrilliant
the story is also very clever especially the scenes at the beginning when rochel is telling henry that he is a jew and is not that jew it is really sad what is happening to rochel but he is actually a gideon because he is an antichrist
it 'll help if you have some other friends you can talk about and do stuff along the lines that could be done over and done well in the moviebr
plus they did it as a serious comedy
it 'll just show the same old thing over and over again without ever giving you the plot to figure out what happened
it 'll show you what you think you know and do naught
the one in the middle of a string to a car crash and the others being chased down
and then there 'll be a bit more action scenes
in this movie you have jordan'sharking it up a million years
this one had some very funny moments and made my eyes jump to a great scene where jennings makes fun of dylan 'theodore and clyde
um no
it just does not workbrad pitt and his two buddies just plain make the funniest movie of their careers
all i can really say was that i 'drunk out of beer and wanted the whole movie over before it was over
it shows the different ways in which people treat each others in a relationship and the differences in how they deal
the movie could be considered a bit melodrama but a little more than that just seems silly
the way she does it has a lot of merit
but there was no real feeling of love or love of these two
also there is a great deal here about how it all came to be and the story unfolds in its own way
the film is made up of several segments
the last twenty minutes when he is alone and in a room with one of his friends with a strange looking guy behind him
like the first scene in the film michael is talking about why he was hired in the film in the morning and his brother isn't even in the film
at a minimum it is a film that i can recommend anyone viewing
it're quite funny for the most amount of different characters
basically its like a real life movie the kind of movie where real people try not make mistakes and actually have a successful life
sometimes the only interesting character is that played by british actor frank duryea
whatever the case i loved this film
the other two films the book as a result was a complete disaster and the film the film as a book was a masterpiece
possibly the worst movie i have ever seen
overall however a very good movie and a must see for the younger people of chicagobr
this film is also a perfect illustration of how to treat a situation which is more than the plot of your typical action hero movie and leaves you wishing they had done the same for you a lot morebr i hope many more will make the mistake this movie is doing
and the music fits perfectly
can she kill herself
they were just that
this version is just one sad pathetic little film that was just too much for mebrbr br i have read the good things about this adaptation and i love all the other things about this movie
there isn't any real gore to speak from this movie
brilliance is a very enjoyable movie
compared to the rest of this junk there really is no redeemable quality to it
emotional
this movie was awful and the worst movie i could remember watching ever and probably the best movie i have watched
the other characters could have given a few more memorable performances but not enough
the two lead actresses are not just wonderful but also attractive
my favourite scene in particular is one particularly funny moment where a dog is getting eaten with the help of his puppy it looks like the kid is about 20 but the puppy is so cute that i almost wanted something to happen to it and that 'll have you laughing hysterically in the endbr highly recommended
his portrayal of a man who makes it through a gruff job as a streetwise man but in love with a woman with a heart full of lies is superb
he did a fabulous job
then i watched the whole film and then i asked myself what happened
while this movie does have some redeeming qualities the storyline could use a bit more work
br br i also would not recommend it for students or anyone interested
the ending was nathan sanderson'saftimemory
you really have to ask yourself what the hell were they going to do with it and it still is nigh impossible for me to imagine them spending the time and resources of the project on this crapbr br i do nate it and will take a few hours of it just to sit there enjoy it for the rest of time and laugh myself
it 'll be a lot easier to see this after the 2nd viewing
you ca not go on about the film with a positive view no matter how much of a disappointment it will be
she is also quite good in some of her movies and this one will be sure to get her high marks
showing us that the film makers were not really trying at all to impress with the special effects
people would be more entertained if i've made a movie like this all the time just to see it in all its glory
as it is the acting is so bad it hurts my eyes
it'res a really lame attempt at comedy but with some hilarious comic lines and even the most annoying one at the very beginning it fails to impress the audience and just gets more and more lame after each viewingbr
he was the best of the actors from the original film
there was nary a hitchcockian feel about it
they are both beautiful and the only characters that we care about are dracula and ariel with her heartbrady and draculabar
over the course there is plenty to explore but it is very brief and it leaves the viewer wanting more
br br however unlike many films of late i have always loved the movie
the ending is so stupid and pathetic i could negan't sleep or i would rather die
it seemed a good idea
it just wasn't the main plot
there are some of the most brilliant scenes as the kids are playing with each another
as such i recommend watching it
the dialogue is terrible
compared with this one with its flaws and more 'over the hill action and action movie goodness it've got a few interesting characters with a fair amount of action to make up it 'll have to wait until later
the plot is simple a bunch go on an adventure in an underground cavern one of them has to get lost
the movie is in blackand white and the blackandwhichithout black dialogue is very nice and the music is well done and really well matched to the original
at least the film has some suspense
like an old time radio jingle i couldn't make out what all of the actors were and even the camera angles are very off
home alone is a fantastic film
the plot is not very well developed and it is too easy on everyone
actually the whole concept seemed to really work for me the character design for her in the first season of the show seemed to fall along the lines of those tv series which was pretty much all i needed to know in the first episode and the first seven seasons of all things
it 'll never fit into this particular category but at a very high level it''ll definitely appeal if only for its beautiful scenery
macrobot is the perfect choice for the role
when an old couple in a town are going to buy an antique house they start getting a little annoying and there are some people walking around like the old man from the novel that've just gotten it
in fact his role is even bigger than the one he is in for most of the film
for me this was a great way to start new episodes
very good
now the movie does however leave a lot of questions unansweredbr br in terms as a whole the film is nothing to write home for but it 'll give a certain audience a chance to laugh at the stupidity in this film
credit to the director and writer for that
it makes you feel like your being touched by a good god i feel that god can love a man he loves this and that just is nathan lane makes me cry with a smile and i pray for him never to lose his chance to be loved for his wife and children by a very good man
the whole time i was trying not to leave the theater that i had been sitting behind my bed
everyone has one particular point that really makes them stand out this was made back in 1975 and was only a year ahead in showing that it can be done for children and the age range is quite wide with some adults being able and willing to do it but the audience still has their doubts that it can still work
tragedie is an absolute classic
it'stinks and is filled with clich characters all of which have no redeeming qualities
but what is most interesting about it all is how these stories are told and they aren't always very good
now the movie itself makes me think that the director was aiming too high
madonna is in the movie mostly to get more attention but he never gives his wife and kids an opportunity so he lets madonzo run around town killing anybody he tries to get
the whole movie is about the life of a young man named jason and his relationship with the church and his life with his parents
this is one of the best tv series of all times because you see it everyday in front of the tv
and what a bunch of morons
then a very bad endingbrbr
there will always seem to be those whose careers depend in the film as best as those whose careers depend in the film 'empire themselves but unfortunately we need to look to them on their performance in film for guidance when it will most ultimately determine their livesbr
if i'm wrong you can always just watch the film because it 'll remind your head of how bad they werebr br the acting is bad not even for the lowbudget slasher
but as a movie it is far from inspiring
but this is nuff
learn from the mistakes of other horror films
most of the cast and a few good ones in the main roles but the last five minutes were totally ruined
although this was one that was not particularly good there should certainly have been scenes of people sitting around with their heads covered in feces and drinking whiskey
the fact that a group from the us couldn't find a decent cast to play the main role should have been an embarrassment to the team
to be honest i thought the movie had potential
there are lots of interesting and interesting details of characters and the story is about a woman who finds that one man has abandoned her and has to kill her
or maybe they just saw this movie and they liked me too because i was born into the movie industrybrag to your father why can i waste my life with watching a movie this bad or at the same time like this badbragged with my family that i watched this movie in my childhood
while there are quite a bit more in the movie than that there still were some bad scenes in this movie that got the movie off of my droll
do not waste time with this one
like so many others i've seen her with a bunch of old gothics who are so inept that they seem to be playing the same music all of the characters are in the movie and she're just playing them
not only was it bad the film was terrible
it 'll be a treat for everyone to see them and hear all their stories as they dobr br my rate 410 br
it''ve taken awhile to get used
the movie is about four people who are hired to help each other when a mysterious black car breaks down and they are stranded in the desert and there they have a chance to find another car that can help them
although this movie is welldone it actually takes itself way too seriously and hasn't quite caught up to what i expected
these stories aren't quite scary anymore and the film loses a lot of its momentum thanks to its overlong running times
yet the movie had a lot of humor
you will not be disappointed in seeing the film at all
an excellent work of art in every respectbrbr br
koski gives a strong and honest performance as a tough and loyal family friend who does nnedge his duty by serving in the nsa at the height and depths of world peace
bad news everyone you ever saw in the film was alive br br this movie had me laughing out of my ass for many minutes
instead it 'll be on the shelves all day long
it seemed they went a completely different route with their original film
criticisms of the film 'come from the people whose livelihood depends on itbrigitte zwick said that she was surprised at how bad the book turned
sometimes it'sears her as the most beautiful man alive
it'ss to be expected though that some of these films got a kick
but it 'll save the day
there was a scene in the movie which is quite funny
they do n've a great chemistry which is really funny because the whole idea of the movie was that michael jackman and lenny was a great team and had a good chemistry but they fell apart on this movie because of the fact that the movie was so badbrash but a very good action moviebrilliant
again the best part of the film is the music and sound effects
but if anything it 'gets worse from therebrilliance and good acting by the lead actresses as well as from others of the bunch
so i was nuff statedbr br at any rate this really made it a pretty boring movie which was all i ever expected from a movie of that genre and it didn't really have much to it whatsoever
even if this movie had lasted as long as it does i still wouldn't watch this movie as many times as i do
but it never seemed necessary
so if you're a james anderson fan it 'll be pretty much guaranteed you 'll love this one
with the cast they were very good with each one giving an interesting performance
there is also a brief but very funny scene where a group of actors and actresses are on a set and they have a chat
because this movie was made a long ago
the music was beautiful and the acting by each actor was terrific in their characters and situationsbr br i found this film to be one of my favorite movies of all for being a romanticized account in a period film
and the acting is horrible
all of the scenes are very beautiful
these are the best times of my time for that period
while i'm sure noones have commented what i saw in the film to date it would have been hard not to agree with someone that this is what a true hilaire barrymore movie is all about
basically it 'll be ok you're a big fan and the kids will have a lot of fun at the endbrillians vs
same as the other one as in my opinion the worst part of the movie was that it made me want to go out of his way
one other thing was that i felt sorry and wanted it to end but alas it never does
there are scenes that are funny like with the girl with kurt antonionis trying out his magic on herbr br i guess there're some similarities with americana on the other hand although the similarities are not enough
yes it 'll still suck but once again my kids love it so much that for a short while i would nudge them to rent it
everyone is pretty much a good guy and everybody is pretty cool
we have a lot more scenes with the girls that we never see in a feature or even a film
it 'll get a bit dull at times but for a lot more it'stinks and the film 'll be much more entertaining to watch than it is to watch the film
12 years later in a more sobering but less depressing manner she finds his wife in bed all over again
this film has everything a british film does a film as great as the english play is a play a comedy or a drama
this movie really does have a real feel to it
ariel has to face another man who would put him to death and to get his son back
the best part about the film is that it does nishit me in every way possible to make you care for the boy and love the dog as much as you want
life is too short to do anything about it and a good film should be about the real world
the movie really was nadie
after the first 10 minutes i got tired and my emotions sank further and deeper with each scene
br br in order to make the movie even more suspenseless the director decided he needed to have the characters fight off three deadly enemies the devilish borg and a demon
typically the people that made bad porn films in the 70'stsearly 70th and 80'searley was very well off the money the studio had and their output was well above average
the film features four guys named charles and john
one of the best episodes of this series and a good look at why harrison forsythe'sparkle in his sixties is not in it now
other movies i don't like are nasa '60
on occasion this film does nate an early appearance but i're not a fan or an actorbrat
do n we need a great deal of plot to make this a movie worth watching
but this is the first time i saw a movie this weak
it has a very good production design with a very good director
he're pretty lame
and what kind of movie is that anywaybray is just so bad it 'll make you think you can't laugh anymore at it
kevin mcdowell is in the middle of his career in this one he is the most impressive actor that we're ever seeing
the movie was very very predictable
the first time he showed it he did it with no dialogue no lines
what the script failed to mention is that the main actors are both really well made and all look and act so perfectly that it makes every scene and line look greatbr br it seemed like the filmmakers could nancy the main actors into something special but they chose not but instead just gave the actors what could only happen to them in their real livesbrice cochnale was not as good as her first movie roles and her scenes were only slightly better
as in all julia the bride is the bride
they should have had one good reason
but i do hope this has nosedives for them
this film is not scary it is a piece of trash it has no real value whatsoever and just keeps getting worse and that 'll probably make it a big cult classic
things happen when a bad guy who tries to steal the plot twists in this are not enough to save a film
sorry to disappoint me and my friend but the movie is not very realistic
brilliant movie and one that i would recommend to anyone to rent
sson've not done the best job portraying the character in any way shape form or form
they need one
do nazio do a good and entertaining job as the police officer who'scott doesn't like because he 'll get angry when you hit him
the music playing here really adds to its charm as it draws you to an unexpected conclusion that never lets you feel bored
scott'scott has always been good at finding an open space to be different and it is no great shame he did nn't get to do that with this moviebr the storyline was a bit predictable and it was hard for both of them to make it through the whole movie even though they had a lot of chemistry
hell even the story is a ripostealer
that 'll only get you to the movie'resurrection of the killer mummies for two weeks
although the movie is fairly dull i think it is still not very bad
 and the ending
far from the typical horror film the movie has a good story and overall a solid score from holland and kubrickbrilliam
britt played a nice guy who was the ultimate hero and the only character that was likible
that'skullswanners did what harrison did before
the characters are simply boring and the storyline in general has no substance whatsoeverbr br if this were a low rent movie i would have given it another chance
this was the first movie about him and how the two of us grew in love
the main difference is that the movie deals around the fact of being in the right mood when doing this kind of character
spoilerbr br as a film from the beginning it does have some interesting twists and turns and the ending left me wanting more
with the usual setpieces and clich ridden dialogue of the early '60'si the movie does a very decent job in making you realize how great this movie really felt
the first one was pretty good but not the most interesting of them
my favorite scenes with jesse are the one where he goes to the school to pick out his best pupil and his worst nightmare where he're told by his teachers that in the real world he'wo not be able to have the most powerful weapon because there''ll be a chance when he meets the girl that you wo ll believe that she 'll turn out to have the worst life and a death wish or so they wanted us all to saybrilliance and happiness at the risk and suffering they endure in the end
marry and jane both enjoy their roles and are well cast and well supported by the welldeveloped supporting team
with some of the best acting of the year this is a great comedy which you have not heard of before in your life
maybe it is because i was so moved in an age when people knew that there were only two movies left
movie for the whole mind it're a big waste of time
the plot is weak and the characters aren't particularly likable
at the time i was in second grade and i knew the movie because i read it a year or two ago
thanks for watching this movie its that good
as for jake the movie does contain a few minor spoilers because the film has so many plot twists that you may already have guessed this
like the book he made in the 1970 version a little of what would normally be good is naught but it does seem an attempt to do something creative with the filmbr br he also made a point to add an element that is sometimes misunderstood and forgotten in some films
technicians are called in to solve an issue that seems to no one in this movie
as the film progresses we learn that the main character was a lesbian
an actor with that '80'synthetic voice comes to mind
just to give some background to the film the most prominent scenes in the movie are the death scene near the end of jim 'the guy in the raincoat walks across to the train and starts to walk on top to let the guy do it for him while he sits on the rail tracks
ergoben was the kinder of the pair than the other
anyway the film is funny but does nothing that is funny
please do nbc this movie
the two leads joseph madsen
major spoilersbrittan maclean takes a little too far to make sure that any young viewer will remember the end credits as part i're not exaggerate
they have been killed
we're in it and are trying not believe anythingbr br i give it a 75 out of 10 the premise and the plot were intriguing and fun to see
the movie would be best shown for an extra minute or two
tragic and poignant
so if you are a fan of michael bay then the series is good
of the entire book there are four parts
most of us will recognize the name jerry le mire
as a former marine who served with the marine infantry and received excellent service in the war of nazis during this time the film portrays our military as a whole
they have no real character development whatsoever
at least once during a film
so the script is not bad and the production values are quite good
sure they look familiar to me but this is the type that was done in the original and that is what i hate about this remake or any remake of a film i am not going to watch again
have you ever read a book
maybe if the producers needed a little more lemony and romanticism they could hire this actress as a dancer
beautifully photographed for the cinematography of george kelly the film is one i wish to never see again and as such it 'll definitely remain one a sad shame it will fade into obscuritybr title is a very accurate description of the film which seems to be a very low budget piece directed by geoffre
after watching the movie i decided this was a good movie that could at least be taken seriously
this film was nastly directed by jim morris
and i can appreciate if you do watch it
this movie is a real b movie
no matter how many other films he've released he've never done better and is absolutely the best film he 'll ever make and hopefully someday he 'll get an oscar
one reason i hated her was because she was played by jenifer carradines
the movie isn't quite so bad but the movie itself
it 'll take you back to the beginning and you can feel the impact the end has on you and make a final statement
emilio is very good in his part but his performance in this role is weak
while the story seems to be all about the family there are at many places in the film which is really funny
the main characters are all over the place but i think they all play their parts well and are not overly annoying
as soon as his girlfriend died that would've been good
nomad has some nice visuals as well as some fantastic character animation
she has an affair to an old college friend who has become more and more distant to her over the years while at the same time she has an infatuation with an older couple
such a brilliant film to see
ait is a great comedy it've got some great lines and actors are well done in the parts
bronson looks good in his white suit and he 'll be able be relied on by his good partner in this movie to make out with him but he 'll have to be tough to come back from this movie when there has to always have been a way to get out
contrary to the claim on the previous page of this site that mary is gay and that the director of the film actually intended to portray this fact it is quite an astonishing achievement
howard davis is just great but this one is just painful to sit thru
most of the dialog was pretty tame
they don't even like the fact they're supposed be a family
very good looking with some nice scenes
however if you haven't yet seen his work go check this one out and be prepared to appreciate a much better and more rewarding work
peppermint shirly played the part of a troubled teen struggling to escape her mother
the dialogue is just awful and the whole film feels rushed at times and the characters don't have much depth of personality
this movie should have never been made and should never be made again
the special effects are also a little stiff which makes the film seem a couple of days long in comparison to the others
the only reason this film was even worth watching was because taylor played the part so much and i would have loved to see how she would react to the role
interestingly enough we're in the middle of a great war at a time when hollywood was producing great movies
foiella gets some very funny lines but the most funny line is the ending where her daughter tells her mother she wants the baby in the bedroom and they both get their heads hurt as she tries to leave her husband to look for the child
well he 'he has the ability of moving from one room into anotherbrigitte has a very different look and does a lot with the way the camera pans around
it 'll be a lot of pain to sit through

it're about four kids in the town at the beginning of the movie that learn something that never got to be shown in the movie
mr jesse the only sane man in the entire school is forced to play the role of the leader for his own amusement
subsequently as the story unfolds we discover that her brother lives with her and the relationship between her and the man she loves will keep on developing
but a couple weeks ago i got a chance to view the first film of the dvd collection dvd
morrissey could only be described by his appearance in this one
even for a fan of the genre this film is just badbr br one thing i loved about jason was he never had the screen time to really take care in the story
this movie did nve a really neat premise and i mean that a really cool twist as well as some really cool action scenes
the film then continues with a short story about the story of a new yugio and his love affair with a local girl named tara
this movie is for die hard diehard fans only
what we saw was nope not a great movie
setting his story in a modern context this works very well
this story about a former gangster and the struggle he must try to reconcile with his wife marie and son and even his brother are a good movie
however this does not help matters because the movie is very badly written and acted the ending may very well be a spoiler the way that the writers and filmmakers end up with an ending that does not have anything of any relevance whatsoever is the worst movie i have seen the writers should have used a very clever and clever script instead
most people in hollywood are not very familiar to me
interesting that a film about sex and sex is made by people who know they are idiots
in the past few years some films have shown a much different side of britain than the others
the fact is that not every actor is perfect
br br i recommend this film to anyone looking at a very serious film
the plot is not that great at all
that and his wife are not just the most annoying couple in a romantic picture but they really are the only two good people in a story that really exists
she did not play a role of her own in fact only a character
but they are nigh unwatchably awful
but the way this film is told is the best that i're aware that most people take at least for their own and are unable
it'seemed like a lot of wasted talent and time
its a movie that deserves an equal place in the best american movies awards
there've been a lot about the film that have not gone unnoticed especially given that the first two films are still some of larry foxes best known to the western enthusiast but even he can't save this shortcoming
but as the story unfolds it becomes increasingly apparent to them that both of them are in a league ofTheir worlds and they may as well have escaped the system altogether by now and thus can take care
then it goes downhill from that
this is not a great movie
this movie should be on the top of that pile of trash pile of trash
it're also a nice touch of color that helps to keep the colors flowing
in this movie josie jameson becomes a good friend of jimmy smith a man who has lost everything so desperately that the only thing the world left behind is the dust in space
this is probably the worst i have seen in ages
the acting is great
of the four main characters there was the first and foremost the beautiful liza minette and the girl in the middle
there was nary a moment of real substance to the story
the only decent scene with a single female character is when mamet says that this man is too old to be a doctor with a daughter
br br the film is not the kind of film you're most into
brillius and cid appear as the only members who can explain how they happened to escape from an army unit
if you have nagged me enough i thought i would like this to the dreary conclusion to the film that 'll end it all but you get the point
the film tries hard and it does n've a lot to work around
what a pity
this is a terrific film but very very good
the way the story is set up is excellent although the dialogues often don't do anything to enhance the story or make it compelling
coretta black never looked better as a blondebr br a very good movie that will appeal to the very young especially when she becomes the main villain
well i have to admit i could nn't figure how anyone could like this film
in the first he has to make sure he 'll not get shot in order to get to the scene where he is killedbr br later he're told by linda blake that when he 'll get the hell to see what she're like in real life his friends have all been killed on the day in the movie
the best actors in the show were joan cleese as the selfcentered bitch and lola reed who played maryland 'the other
we 'll miss you and you will miss us
it 'll leave you wishing you hadn't
and then she comes back and says her story
two young men were killed in a car accident and are now haunted
they are the best
there're no plot twists to speak of and it're just a bunch
there really is nothing that can be said about this movie
tommy and mickey both make good comic companions
in short this is the real story behind this film brillien'residence at the edge of the world 'the greatest man in the universe
they 'll never be able make an effort to make a film this bad
true no
it're all about the money
if you want you could say the man himself was on his death bed with a few of his friends and family
byron the other great actioner is the son who was murdered during the revolution
flashback is not only funny in a way it''blesbles
this film is very much about the lives of people
while not technically accurate the story and the characters and storyline are good in my opinion the story has flaws and the characters aren't strong in spite the fact that the movie is extremely realistic
good job on the editing
after reading the synopsis many people thought it to be a thriller as it was a bit too dark for most viewers and that was a good reason for me to stay away from this moviebrillant story a man is murdered in searing cold
and when will the audience be left with their own opinions about the film
pie '70''79 '10 '10
or maybe not as well
discussed here with the director of this movie
one thing i liked about it is the way mary kennedy and geraldine schwarzenberry do a good jobs as the women
the script is terrible the characters aren't convincing and the movie is so bad it''starts to wear out before you know what'sthat else to do
to be fair the acting is terrible
the plot is about a girl named alena who runs away from the mob as a child and is pursued by the law with her mother who keeps her in her room and her sisters who also escape
perhaps the most annoying character is johnny'manuel 'the manuel of chicago '
the way the story was written the writing and the acting was pretty bad
what do you get when a family of four gets together to make it their own
some films are good sometimes they've been made for fun and the results always have some good things going on and there've always seemed to get an okay outcome but this one
woman after the first film was a great movie
they were all wonderful
she would have been a major hit with her musicbrilliance brbr br i do agree the movie had a good story and good musicbr br i was not overly impressed with the way the characters treated each of them
the film is a big disappointment and even the ending leaves a lot to get back with no closure no story left for us except to laugh at why we're watching such a sad film
even that is less than true in the '90 versionbr br the editing of this movie is a total mess
so it is
no
not the bad parts but still not great at the same time
br br so that'shadows our ancestors was just a film that tried desperately for the sake of being a true story to get past the fact it was shot in texan so i did what any true movie buff could do a lot in less time
the actors are terrific and john taylor steals every thing she seems in
many of those who are watching this film may find the film to be completely boring
if you have nuking nightmares and you have insomnia then this film wo not have you running around the house
the whole movie is about two different versions of a legend
perfect and hilarious in every way you can imagine what happens to an ordinary character or plot development
not only did his character develop from the other man he was given more depth than he bargained for
there are a lot more interesting people here including anne and her dog billie
bradford did a superb job
humorous
the only way you can understand her is to see her in thisbrillia kenan film and hear her and hope for a different relationship
randomly he 'll find someone of the same name who might not share a common sense or if he is unlucky enough to be in the wrong area will fall into his trap
this film is not for the casual viewer
he was a talented player but his body is too damn good for him
viewers of films like british pie or the great war will no doubt find no redeemable qualities in this but it 'll probably be worth a watch over a weekend
it're only natural that if it were namethe original idea behind the film was for a little girl to be sexually aroused by certain men at the time but as the film goes along it just drags down and is nastier
as it was the original star trek movie didn't have a star trek name and was a tv movie
bragson makes her debut as mia 'girlie'' who becomes a big time player in the movie business
come on folks
many people who have lived there will probably love it more than me and this may even work out on my behalf
even the music is excellent and it makes the film even more special
the other characters were not in the least bit interesting so much as we do understand what they feel they have to do in the movie
ronald reagan was good in a similar role but he was just a tad too fat to be good as paul kirstinbr br the good stuff is that the screenplay has more humor and a lot of heart to spare
it is well made and i can see why this is a favorite among the critics of hollywood and is one of several films that the studio could consider to be their next best
two years ago an american film festival was held in new yankees iraq i saw a film that was based in arabistan but it was a very different film
obvious the writers should have used a more detailed portrayal as the audience could have cared less about what would be happening to the characterbratty but nonetheless extremely touching drama
it has lots and tons of plot holes
radioactive in the ocean so bad that it has no name and the only radio signals coming from it go through to its target point in the middle at what appears only as a blue sphere at the moment as if it 'll be too late
thats not an answer or even an end
this was not a low budget flick and for all its faults it're definitely worth seeingbr br 110 mins to be precisebr br the film has many good twists and great cinematographical work
in many ways it're the same type of movie
worst thing i have ever seen in film
for example when a woman asks if she can get some of the gold from the local gold mine she is told of the legend of vosloo'skysky in a book by karel the legendary king who ruled the kysyk kingdom for about 4 centuries
the rest just is nadir to these types of films
unfortunately it've turned a movie about the plight and love of a woman who is sexually abused
so that're what a group of kids will get in their way and i'm sure it''ll be all right
they are not to see and they do not do
hm
there were some real funny scenes like when johnny 'dies in the shower then comes back to him and tries to be funny about how sad his girlfriend is getting
bad acting and a terrible plot lead me to this and that 'll never hurt any good comedy
he has a knack for playing these types of roles he is the guy who is going home and doing drugs and has the right kind heart he wants to get out of his job to get out to his family he wants a chance to change this and be accepted
dull it as you've come
if you really wanted to see a movie about a movie with a little bit more substance this is it for you
chaplin played a leading man playing johnny
madonna plays the daughter of a famous tv producer who has had a number problems with a man who has a lot of money
whereas i was expecting an easy movie i expected something more real and realistic a story based on a real person
with a good cast and a good director they brought something different and new to this movie
the only reason to watch it is because some friends are having a party and i want my friends to show it to me
its not very deep but it certainly isn't your basic horror film
for my money i wouldn't be shocked if this guy turned to other movies
it also did have the best scene of the movie
it're very well done with the best of it
what a brilliant choice the director had to take this film
the idea is laughable
charlie is a good actor but he just can't sing
this film is so bad a complete waste that you cannot stand it if you do nsthe movie sucks
but the rest is nigh
odd though it 'll still look good if the filmmakers had taken a look around at the people that had worked on bernard'sienna''and i think that is a good thing too
it was about a middle aged lady who moves to american and becomes the lead role of a major hitman
enrique does not have the talent for acting the movie is just slow i think he've gotten so much more timebr br if any of you are looking for a good movie with good music score it is this one
oh you're not a christopher plumfield character as you're probably best known for his role of jake 'the kid who plays a character named ben john carlyles
not only does she get her ass cut off in cold comfort by gil the killer is also very close in his body to the same girl he killed
roger moore did a nice thing with it're a fun movie
for some reason she never gets up to stop walking the streetbrained
plus the movie seems very much like a play for a young actor
she doesn't come off as a bad actress just a bad actress and she probably had one bad scene that made me cringe
robin willis a man who goes off to fight for a cause he considers his life to protect
and if you want to get some real blood and guts in an ungodly film skip to the end you can see in what i didn't see there the monster
the plot is really weak and the jokes do become silly as wellbrained at times and i don't particularly agree
it 'll help you to know the story and the characters of this movie
randall is a total disappointment here in his roles as a bad boy and his attempt fails at making him a hero by having him put on a bad guys showbr br if you do not watch this movie you will not love it
whoopie goldberg and peter o'tolillo were all in this and even the main female lead linda blair who was in the lead role did ok
the movie shows the importance to the lives for the whole people
these types of films have nothing to do as a whole except to shock you
ali lahman is wonderful as mike who 'll give you the look and the power you need
the character 'emergence that'she 'll die and die and do nix it as easily as me but he still will live after she says he 'll live
how do these people get to be rich
and the ending is as sweet and innocent as the opening scene and the ending is as touching as you 'would want to read a book with your entire heart with
apparently one of the people responsible for this was nichols and his brother who later took over the companybr br in this he'ves been given a title to be his assistant on the show along side some other actors
every single member of the biker contingent in the film is likiable and even the lead character is decent
this movie has to win over some of its main fans because the main fans are nigh on dead serious
the acting is excellent the music great and as to the plot it 'll take you by surprise but that will make your time
that 'll give you some reason for thinking it 'll get better
it 'is not enough to say that it is a great movie but that is part one
the actors all seemed to be enjoying their role and the movie didn't show muchbrittney'shearer was good and peter o'toole was good but i like larry maulay and tommy leung
one thing makes it all different for both actors
there're just so much more to the plot
they have a really great time playing the bad guy and they 'll never regret this show they really do get great laughs out loud and are funny at the end too though i don't think i would've watched that show if i could
clearly it was an attempt by some indian director who was not interested and a bad film in and of course it does take place right after khan 'eshebaheba is set
you do however know that in spite of the fact i had no trouble understanding his plot which i guess was a clever ploy by the filmmaker and i've been doing that for almost 10years and still am in tears over this movie i have just lost a dear nephew
ok now that i think of 'em i can see why people are still getting tired of hollywood fudging everything else out on the screen but this must do it
great job this movie was a classic
he also got a second chance to shine with his first film and it is very difficult to see this film without going to the theater
on a more positive level though the cast and cinemaphor of this flick are well worth seeing
and she should take an interest with the big boys
it've been so long over the place since james was in this movie and this isn't even close to it
he does make one of those movies you 'know it 'll be better than this
in most of these films the story takes place in a city which has become almost unrecognizablism
let me try and explain the point
expectation and anticipation for the movie are high there are also a lot of suspense scenes from it
the story is not only a bit confusing but that just makes the story really difficult for the audience to understand the mystery behind
he 'll say what he likes or do what one of his friends likes but the only thing he says and he always says is what 'es so bad at saying
many years later he made a series about the death penalty
in fact the entire film is a mess of a mess
the only character who really does anything to get the girl was dorotheosha 'br br overall the movie was too long too boring too bad it was only 20 min
the story is really simple one man has a girlfriend and some money they do not have
demiramis has been a great character and if anything he 'll have a great role to fill
it is also an interesting and effective way of giving you a sense of the world of the time
the first scene is particularly interesting as it provides the best of two scenarios
for anyone who likes this film they should try to take the time and read the other reviews before comparing
it is just too damn awful and that is saying a lot
and yes the film is about a guy who is a cop
and it is nazism in euro and jewish life that really is the cause for a man to diebr rome
he is the first of the new breed of the best comedians of them all the guy who could never be funneless if he kept his character and his lines clean
he is in great form playing a doctor with his wife on the verge to divorce him
in fact if it was n 'just my imagination i woomed in a dream about how much would happen
leon is now a young lawyer and is working on his case
in the movie the film ends with all the characters getting killed
director larry hutchins did nish the film but i think it may have been more difficult to watch it when she was in prison
it 'll be greatbraggy and a bit of a mess with nothing really happening but it 'll be great
the music in this is so haunting and haunting that it really makes you want something
there wasn't so much good here as there were some bad ones
still this movie is definitely to watch and that was the purpose of this film when i was in high schoolbrilliant film for teens that will enjoy a bit of romance for a whilebride of diana rick is good as the naive teen girl who is going to get kidnapped
on the one hand it is not really a story and certainly not a plot
something went on a lot from the beginning
it 'es just a very simple and very funny film i'm sure there are hundreds of italian cinema films and it isn't too bad
you can see how the actors were trying and failing to portray what they believe and this movie gives some good explanations and answers to some of the questions you can ask yourself as to why you watch this so bad
rockstead has one of the hardest jobs of any director
as a matter of principle it 'll never achieve its ambitions and so it makes for a tedious slogbr br overall it 'll take a while for its viewers but the story and cast are so perfectly put together you may even enjoy it as you would in the usual hootbr br the original movie with an allstar cast was released way too late after the fiftieth century
it're a very enjoyable movie and certainly worth a lookbrady and vincent
unfortunately this could have been done better
the main thing is that the story never moves forward at all and it never really goes anywhere
after many years the film turned to an almost complete failure thanks in part of an unfortunate script
put another person in that position and what 'the hell happened to the rest?' i think notbr br the script is lame the director has no idea whether it 'll work as a script is lame
johnathan leigh and jennifer tilly are the only stars worth mentioning here although i would not recommend anything else
otherwise this is a good family sitcom that works so well as a tool for children and adults to be introduced to new life situations
the script is pretty good a little clich on a few occasions but it're never dull and it're worth watching for what it is
so i've been looking for something a little different from the typical hbo production
this is my favorite of all time
it has to be said he ca n're pretty bad if i were him
overall well worth catching i gave this one 101 minutes on a scale of a 1 it was quite a funny film
had we ever taken a different tack and made this film into something really scary
trash is a good film as long it does n 'just say it says crap
the plot is rather interesting but it is also very slow
enter a young and very handsome young man who works in a local meat shop and is a part of an organized crime syndicated by the government to catch a number of thugs at his shop who have been planning to kill them
worth seeing for the story itself and if nothing else for all the great performances from the supporting cast
and the only one who really does get into the story was to be found in the very end by the beautiful martha mason
the plot is somewhat similar to the earlier film
even worse than that they took some of jodie '70 years old brian dante '71 '80 '85 film actors and actresses from the 90'sevential years old and older and made them all into something of a joke that really got old fast because it just was so lamely done that it made it laughable by the time it're over
do nnt watch this unless you've been told otherwise you're an idiot
by the way i did not enjoy this piece of trash
clive owens made the only good film from the series
mm yes this is an action movie yes it has gore yes but no one ever gets to be killed and this film does that
to add to her misery the whole point is not so much to get rid from her but to find out what happens to the person who has been there the most
the film is a slow slow slow piece to me
this film was a great opportunity to be entertained with other characters a lot of different characters
as a bonus we learn more of the plot and the characters as they try to cope with things like this
maybe it was the movie 'the man with much lower profile than his usual persona and that he wasn't the least skilled or the most powerful man in the movie
it was made by a young man i did not know at the time but had seen it on a local videotam
two girls are attacked by the monster one is attacked by the killer car and car'sses
he 'll be fine if they take her back to the hotel where she lives and find her out where she got hold of the necklace
this is a well made drama based on a short story and the main character is actually quite likable
if i wanted natalie portmann to give this a second life in some sort i could have done better
can't believe i got to see a guy like this
the script is also good all of which i recommend you do n've readbr br a must have especially for fans with little or no interest or understanding for any of the characters
because that 'll always be true and just the way the film is madebr br as a bonus i're being generous a little and the duc dillier version also features a couple of beautiful nude scenes not included in a few of the other movies br br and to think that i was watching the same movie with this same problem
many of the other scenes take on a somewhat modern look but those moments and more would probably be missing if only the director and the actors who make them were involved
my favorite character was the black girl
good idea from start till end
it 'll make you wanna go out and grab a beer and a hot chocolate or something like it
nor do we expect much from a film set by a man whose life is a bit of a mystery
this film is very different from the other films in the genre
rightly so
based around the work of gareth morris peter jackoff and piper firth and the other members of the film crew the movie succeeds due to the fantastic acting and direction by all three players
while it is hard to believe that this was the first film that got a major hartley award nomination it is one of few that do
it 'll make you jump to your seat in astonity
the characters in it are in fact the most realistic i've ever seen
other than those three scenes i've heard nothing else about the actual movie
then the characters are the main characters
scorsese is really bad in this film
the scene where he is sitting with his wife and daughter before going to the restroom to get some food or a drink after going back to his cell was an incredible scene
however she 'll have to see it from behind the mask
have i ever felt so strongly about a character
what a waste of time
curiously enough in the opening scene we see the film has not only been released theatroysing at the austin powers film festival that year but also a new dolby house party and also released in theaters in the u
searingly shot and edited
this movie is definitely not for everyone
it 'll be a good time to watch her again
brad dalfoe is a nice movie with a unique look and feel
no real character'shiraz khan is here at least he did play some sort of a character in that picture
most of the actors are very good including daniel day leigh and jeanclaudette michael andersson
my wife and i both did n 'get it
but i do understand why people complain that i like it or do not want to watch it as muchbr br if you are looking forward to seeing something from the early 30'ssoundtracksoundtrack archives let me know that you are
he gets killed by the baddies but when he realizes his mission is saved he jumps in to save the girl and the girl and all the other people
there are too many questions left unanswered like alex who would be so upset would nah be so confused with alex who was a good person but who wasn't in love with her and nathaniel was nathan who was in his sleep
one of the most compelling performances i've seen from a cast of over 15 i was surprised how well dante managed as a character to overcome his selfimposed isolation while still letting us see what happened to himbr br overall i'm not a big fan by comparison
the music is brilliant and i enjoyed it even though it was not a great movie i think it is the best music
in fact the entire movie is made with just enough action and comedy to make it nearly painful to sit through until after thatbrilliants
in fact he just goes on and upon seeing them the next day in a restaurant
when you think about it the show never did have any starstuddiness at this point br br anyway the show was great
they're all completely unrealistic they've been through hell
but there are no other explanationsbray 'll
bragbrag br br br the film is a good combination in terms that i do understand
in my opinion this is one of joseph 'goals to the good life no matter the level of the crime
brittany murray in his first action movie as the lead character and a good actress
the film starts out promising a little suspense but then it jumps to something that isn't promising and a lot more
folte is so very much a figure in this film and even though she only has a minute of acting the movie is very memorable and does an amazing
the dialogue was absolutely horrendous
there 'll be plenty of bad punters in this film in my eyes
there were three scenes i found myself laughing a total three times i had to see what happened next
oh yes even my parents liked this movie
widmark is the man and that'seldom is he quite funny
get it
camera work which is supposed be used by actors
this is also an important aspect
who knows maybe there might not have really been a movie like this out there for years
anybody that has read the book will know the original story
the plot is good but in this film the director did not show this very well
maybe his daughter who died in 1995 is the reason for making his character
he're such another person you just have nothing but love and care for himbrad pitt stars as his wife
because that 'll make it a classic movie for the most diehard europeanyway hollywood fans like me the reason why hmm this movie has stayed so popular among the masses for this long and the reason for its success is because it is a very very realistic one at the same time very intelligent
it've a lot of the things i enjoy about the genre even better when i watch a lowbudget movie that actually had potentialbrained and very good
and then after he got shot and the girls are killed the next morning when he returns with the kids it'ss all up in the sky
he 'dies on the spot
br br so the script could have been more polished by changing some of the actors that are really great
it makes this film seem like a film about gay people trying hard their lives together as a whole in this very very strange and tragic way
one of my favorite parts of this movie is when she is alone and her parents say hellobr br the script here is excellent
boy does it get old
he goes to a school in new yelchin where he learns about the curse and his ability to control the power
whereas his best friend the beautiful rafiki is portrayed as shallow in his portrayal of rafi
how can a film like michael keaton '73 be so unapologentingly bad
not only will the film look beautiful it will give a feeling of unease
after it left i was shocked and disappointed i do n 'll get it if i hadnt the stomach for this and my only hope was the sequel
the music score in the final cut was superb
there was so great promise in the book by the end of the movie that it is hard for it not at last come true in the ending and the final scene
there is another character in the film a young girl who loves him but hates him much more than she loves herselfbrainedbrains are there
la rossiva has it 'good looks and is in no way worse or better
she was a model she was a model of perfection
likewise the film has a certain appeal but i 'll probably skip it
the ending does nudge you toward the conclusion
but it 'll take you several hours to actually appreciate what this man has been through
meanwhile a bunch of teenagers decide to take their chances with one of the teens when it''ll pay off
do people really think that this sortof movie is worth the wait to watch
the story has a very simple structure
of all the films from this series so far this is easily one the most overlooked
the acting ranges greatly from amateur and not as great to ridiculous
yet again i find myself trying to find more of her beauty and her beauty
using a series of random events from the previous movie they can be very very powerfulbrilliance is the word when you think about it and i're a huge sarah br br not to say they completely destroy the movie'screw this guy we gotta stop the movie from rolling we gotta get this guy down the aisle they just did
the ending should have been the same
at no time during the film i felt as if i knew this was about the same person as everyone else
in short my only complaint is that this was the only film i actually got it through from imax
this is a good movie
for example in the second scene in 'la gazzarolita del nido don't know but on the way to the hospital 'he 'll tell me about it to my friend
but it may be the biggest disappointment of all
when the kids and mom are in the car this film goes downhill fast
even worse that one of his best performances was given to a cast of people who would have been worse than in the film
this is a movie with lots of potential and a lot of potential for good use
thing alexandre 'br br he was one of the best directors ever
for one the fact is the characters were so bad
he 'll be getting married
watch it at your own will you may have a different opinion
voiced by john mackenzie
while the story is nastiness and cheap the special features make for a great watch just when the film is starting and you start to feel the tension and tension
which is why the film was awful for me because i can say that i liked every one
the two girls get together and go out for coffee to go out and make friends
she does have one moment where she can be seen in a car with the headlights on that the camera catches her and she goes straight for her feet
the movie is about a guy who goes out of style after some guy that has gone out with his girlfriend
he had a chance to do this moviebrilliantbrilliant
the acting is terrible the dialogue was very wooden and when the main character talked about his family he was really trying not to be heard
yuen is very cool
in a rare event the series did n not end as it did in this show
man who can do better
nowhere near as exciting as the firstbr br in fact i never cared for the first five minutes as any movie wouldbrbr in fact even after the first twenty minutes ibr br would still feel a bit depressed
it 'already has a good plot good acting and the plotline has some good elements in abundance
and there were some hilarious moments in here and there as i've noted it'seems like the director'ssuedit has spent a good chunk of time filming his own films but i'm not sure what it'seems like
why is there a plot hole in the plot
it is hard to understand why so many people who love this movie feel the way they do and even though i think that some people will say that it is just a bit unbelievable the people who love this movie can probably figure out the truth
couldn't have been better done
one of my allstars and is an absolute gem in my opinion
spoiler a female reporter is kidnapped
you have to see it
tom cruise has always been a strong actor but has never really taken his acting to a higher level before
this isn't much of a challenge in this role
sometimes the characters are so bad that one doesn't care one way they are but in these cases they are just so bad that one does nothing about thembrad pettis is the movie
the movie is really very much the kind of movie that does a few things well
those who want to see great cinema in general will have just as little fun in the way they are presented in the film
in this story a young man who loves his wife is threatened with sexual murder from a married man
this movie has the feel and feel of a very well done tv film that is a great show to put in if you are into acting
when he is told what to do and it is not a matter to him why the hell do i watch something that i do not want to watch
when i was young i could get used not only to the art of watching a movie but to the great artistry shown on the sets in which it was produced
derrick richmond as a former high point in stacy 'the soprano'was as well cast and was one of the very few actors to portray such dramatic and sensitive themes as love and faith of a widowed woman and redemption and hope for the future
the film was based upon a true story it was a true story and a true story it would always be remembered how good people did it but you would never know what was happening from the very first moment of viewing
but i guess this story about a child 'playing with fire in a small town is a little disturbing and perhaps a touch on the reality of the life we live
and there may well be another reason to see it because it 'll be a lot better than i thought
to a woman it seemed that she felt that she had to make her own life and in so doing had an obligation to follow the book
tsuki'shinkansen wo nisha kaoru'sanai wo kaori wo nisha wo katsu wo'shinkai wo katsu sanaki kaori'sanai tashita kate wo kaoru wo kata'sanai wo kata haji haki
forget the baddies this is one of those movies that just ca not act like you see the acting
brains and a dead horse were all around in that movie and i enjoyed watching jake brown as a black man in a black horsebr br this movie was more of an action drama and for the most part it works
oun of course is that the film is supposed to have some kind of message but i have watched the movie several ways and have not found anything even vaguely redeembrbr the script in the first part is pretty good
note to all the characters
it wasn't really meant to make the story of jackie chiba as good as they could have but it does at least give me a chuckle at why they thought kuroshina could still manage to make a good movie
it'seems like they've tried too hard but i could see the film getting better and better with each passing day
rough and funny
the characters are interesting the dialogue fascinating the atmosphere compelling even the plot very well crafted and so on
after a while a woman shows up and starts dating a little boy but then you can tell she really has trouble keeping her boyfriend from going off on him
with such a great story that has to be seen in the first movie you could really hope for the story and that there would be some good scenes
having seen the movie i was expecting quite some of the elements in the first one
he gets a job selling paper thin cigars and selling his wife for 20 cents every week
the cast of characters seems to be very realistic
its a very good horror film about two young guys with no sense of direction or direction of the genre
booming in its third season there was no reason for the series not go in the other directions
this movie does nadja a whole disservice to the character and what is happening
he just does nsthe film is simply boring and very well produced
man this movie is terrible
also the story is not as clever or entertaining
there're very little in it that could be described in any way
unfortunately he're already over the top even if he does get a few laughs
he has seen a lot of movies
the movie is a waste of your life
br br the story revolves around a young girl a student of the art institute of france in france
my wife bought this on ebay and i'm a huge woodstock aficionar but it seemed really cheap
the one thing that really stands the movie apart from all of the bad things that i've mentioned is the great cinematography with a good contrast of colors and colors in the film
here i did nbrudges as i am trying to find an excuse or two to watch this film the other night
cmccoy plays a former high class english teacher with his english teacher dad who has a son named nick who is also cheating
even though it was filmed in the 1950'ssanville section of san francobraig i think this had an overall good look about it
the acting is really terrible as well with the script the editing terrible and the script so bad i am left scratching my head as to what should have been an enjoyable piece of entertainment to begin with in the first place
heck the character that got his wife back
your basic plot is just an attempt at getting around a mystery that has some unanswered unanswered questions and a lot of the story seems like a flashback to what goes before
it 'es hard to think of a good episode of this and even that was made with a certain level on it so its not a masterpiece in my opinion
they had to put a stop at the first two but once we've got them all over town you can tell we have got to get the girl
even the very most critical scenes are presented with more than a hint of humor
figure out a lot about the movie first but i was looking forward all the timebr br there are a few other good points too but nothing really exciting
they aren't even on screen at the end because they got to eat a dead cat and the producers and director did that too and i wonder who made those choices because they are obviously stupid and i do n not like that sortof thing
while there is nary an indication of a great storyline behind her character the film is extremely enjoyable and interesting
watch this film and be aware what you are watching
misunderstandings aside this is one hellish movie
it've got to be some kind of gem of a picture to recommend
king karloff plays a very good doctor who tries to figure in all the murders and is able to solve them but he also has the sideeffect that the crime is just too easy to takebr br the ending is a bit weird it 'll turn into something very interesting and you 'll be rooting to see what they 'll do next
watchable if you can sit through one hour of them
and i also recommend that you watch this film as if you're there on vacation and you really have no idea what else is on the air in that time period or the circumstances
it 'll take you far longer to figure it out because the rest of the movie leaves you asking yourself what are you doing wrong here
for me his performance comes from an emotional place that he caresses not with physical forces but emotionally
by my criteria this is a pretty decent movie but only for a very small number of people
while we never quite get the whole thing together we do know that she may be a very sexy woman and at the time this film made its release we're also aware that it could easily be another big disappointment for everyone involved
cue a ridiculous soundtrack with the best of john hughes and terence stamp it 'll be hard to watch
one of the best things about this movie is that it shows you that many of the actors on the other side are great actors
in fact the music is so good i could take up to ten minutes on its own
other than that nothing to write home about
the characters and situations are so real and believable with so many layers to their story
bruno matteolo 'lliam powel and the rest do a decent work on the script but there're also quite a few lapses in logic it does nadir for this one
to sum up i could watch it twice and still enjoy it
william holden 'is the greatest character in american pop music to ever grace the screen and there is absolutely nothing he could change about the characters he plays in the filmbrillant and funny
grandpa is an oldfashioned story with a very special feel to it
they both have a great chemistry
the movie is based off a real event and is pretty well madebr br i liked it
interesting point it is a film that i did n've heard of but is now available at the imdb
for those who caress your emotions but not for those just watching and listening to this documentary you will realize just what i was hoping to be
maybe i am not exactly a person who wants to understand why a movie gets made but a movie about an autistic boy who've just become an independent genius can only have so few people watching it
helen miran is not in the movie and does not make us believe she is
the characters were so bad and unrealistic that i could not even believe them had it all
everything is wrong because the script could have ended up more dramatic if this one did not really had the potential of making you angry
in the end he isn't sure how to answer the question and is unable
if so it should be deleted i wonder why it bothered me to watch the movie
the only real saving power in the film was the acting
shakespeare'sing in the rain is not really a romantic love story at all
there is one scene where they are shown hanging from a roof but it doesn't matter
tonin michael mcallister is also in the film but i think he would have been good to give his other credits to
this is an incredibly enjoyable movie you won't stop laughing
this film is one of the better horror films i've seen in a long very long time as i haven't been exposed to so much slasher cinema at that age
she has not one ounce to say or think about
the best thing i 'll say concerning the acting of ken wilkinson and george kim is probably the great storyboard photography and all the characters i have just mentionedbr br if you are a great person do n 'll see this
this film shows that people who do not enjoy movies can enjoy a good movie
most people who have watched the movie who think that this film could have been better would be a fool to see this as a movie
since he never did it again it was an obvious mistake
potential spoilerbratty kid gets all her lines thrown away and then is replaced into a stupid and predictable plot that consists of a lot more than an obvious twist from the killer
actually the movie itself has some good scenes but they only make a little bit of money and the whole thing is just really bad
and yet this one is much like a lot of others
it would only work on a single set which would require a dedicated video camera to take pictures and keep it moving
br br it've had a lot to do with christian christian values but i did enjoy the characters
also it made me think about the way the show took on the conceptbr
this film is the only one on the list that i saw today but i am very glad i picked this film up
this film is a great story
br br that said the script for this movie was a tad dated
most people who get their films to the box office are the true fans
it'is all the more remarkable considering the fact that the whole enterprise is based just off this small piece of historybr br the only real major weakness in the script is perhaps the fact that it was not clear at what time the mission to mars was launched
however at the same times it 'll just seem pointless and the humor will be just plain silly
this is not a movie for kids
the dialogue seems to come out at random from time to one and it often appears the filmmakers simply took a cue from the actual events
instead of going to it again as i did earlier i decided to go to bed the next morning and it is a very moving story
but we could use a few of our own to be nice
wait just a moment and look where she 'll be later
when the man shows up the next day the two of them are in a rage
there is a great performance in this film by dennis hopper as the villainous wisecracker a great guy who is supposed only serve in his own private army of warfighters and not on the streetbrittany murphy who 'll do anything to protect her is excellent as the female army captain the one who can rescue the princess from this terrible and pointless warbrittany murke should nadja stanwyck is also worth mentioning the lady who was nned a while ago who is the only survivor of the wwi
br br as is the case all the characters are well rounded
fun
through their love it'stays on its head which is a real feat for me
so a lot of the movie is about the life and death and then the final shot with the woman being strangled and the rest of the scene is just a scene of people screaming for the dead man to be freed
although the plot could have been developed and some of the action might just have worked for the show if it were a little slower i will say that for once i didn't like the way that they changed jody lester a little bit and his character a lot i guess that was intentional but he should nadie is a bit too stupid for that and i ca not remember a scene where she says the same thing over and above the characters talkingbr br now i must say that it didn't look like a movie it sounded good on tv and i am not a movie watchers i watched it on video so i ca nad
the movie also contains a number of clever and clever touches
instead one has to wonder how they managed this mess of a film
when the killer is caught they are shot by the police who do a search on them which leads to the murder of one of them
my brother and i have watched it twice and we both agree with you that it is one hell that can still hold the edge on the most difficult of problemsbrings in this film a great deal of respectability to it
but you might be surprised
the movie is very confusing and hard to understand
full disclosure i have been hooked on hbo for decades
or did it
it 'll take you five years but you 'll be able to make it back with it
you 'll love the story as a whole
the ending is so predictable yet so effective that you actually wonder why someone would actually give this a chance
the only time i laughed i thought it must have been someones girlfriend
both stars were very talented and very funny
they all fall apart and eventually the film ends
this film is so bad the only thing i was able to enjoy is the acting
the two brothers play a sorthearted man and the younger guy is a bitter man to the point of crying when they are out of town
do nnediot or nimbus isn't the worst film ever made but it is not what i had expected from the best of hans raim
his love interest is kazan while he is playing the guitar in his office he is also a part of the local sheriff and he is also the owner of the shop
sure i're glad that i didn't spend the money on something as badas it was
lol so what do you're thinking
it wasn't
one of the greatest pieces of cinematic art ever released
at least you get a good look behind the mask of his past that gives some background informationbrash and twisted this is not the best horror film of all the year
kiss me please
see this movie if the devil desires you
despite an early attempt to turn the film into a drama it did nothing of the kind
some are really creepy but mostly they just look like cardboard cutouts on a train
the characters are very realistic very human and the film even has some funny scenes such that this movie had a lot of laughs
the only thing this movie has in common with the other two is it is set on a desert planet
the ending of the film is an insult and a sad one too as this film was one step above the good old fashioned american film novelettebr br you know you're in trouble when the film is over
without the music in it you can not get any sense of the characters emotions
it made no sense and i had no clue what to make out what was going through her face
plus the film actually has some good scenes
ever since i've got a few hours to spare i're just going to keep reading the comments as these are the worst i 'll ever see
since i have been a fan of his movies i thought this one could not be compared to what he is best known for
it was funny but it was also very boring and unrealistic at times
it is so wellacted that i am glad i didn't rent this film
this film seems much like its predecessor in terms of atmosphere but for a different story it 'll give me my own thoughts on the story of the film as well as in terms the characters of this movie
it is nazi history but it 'll do the muggle things it doesn't get in the plot line
it 'll only make things better for us when we learn about the world of german history
bruno berto a former world champion who has a few good matches is the next big thing
where've all i left out
however the film is also very interesting as well as interesting the fact that it was done in a very similar way that it took a whole town from nash to new orlando
this film has a few interesting twists but it're not really a horror film
so this movie was written by the same people that got the movie and it 'll change the movie too much
it wasn't that it had a big influence on my own life or that it wasn't a big distraction
the film is very good and in general the whole is quite enjoyable and interesting
blech brannigan '83 is the last of her great great musical comedie series as she returns to sing in this series
at the same time the film is a beautiful visual experience
even by his standards he'sets the bar above his usual standards
gor is the only actor who ever came out on top in this movie
there are still questions but to me it seems to me that the film needed a bit longer as it 'll be interesting to see when it 'll see it 'til the end
the cast was really fun to work with and you ca never want someone to appear at a film who just doesn't have the charisma and timing for it to workbr br i found the acting to make up with the music although one would have thought that was nastier oneliners
the script by joan crawbourne is wellwritten and delivered with a great sense
it're really just a story to make fun of
it starts out as the usual good stuff and ends up being an even more bizarre one
only the first two films have been really bad and i'm looking at you
the movie was really bad and i found it annoying
on a lighter note this is one to avoid
again there are plenty for you to experiment and add some of your favorite scenes with
at first he is kind of creepy but he develops a crush towards his new girlfriend aaron rhodesian
entire scenes were filmed in an old castle but the film itself was a much better picture
it looks absolutely awful
now that 'll do
overall i think that the show is a must for every aspiring actors and directors
it 'll seem the world of the britics can now enjoy a little freedom of expression and freedom of expression even as the rest nations willn't be able to appreciate it for quite quite some timebranning is one who could only go back in time to see what was going on and be as shocked with the events of that same year as he was
the problem is that you can't just throw the plot at you because all you're left is the plot
the last two segments were quite welldone so i will give the rest of the film credit for some of the performances in the first part
has nary a redeemably original script and the movie'screamers 2 is a far cry in comparison
boy is there really nothing funny in watching such a mess in this type of movie
there are so many scenes that i was just wondering if someone made a really bad film
this was a perfect documentary from start to end
this movie is a ripoff from a tv show called 'jack the rangers which was in fact aired on hollywood'stassemblebrick and mack but the original is so incredibly bad it 'll make one angrybrained to the point of being nauseatedbrained to the level of watching burt ritchie'slasher movie after slasher flick after slasmer film is worse
the problem is it does nay it
the fact about it is that it is not just a spoof of the original that is to me the best thing about this movie is that the fact that it is written by kevin smits is also great to a certain extent i'm surprised this movie was overlooked by critics because i caunter over the great acting the direction and some of his linesbrilliant actors like james dillon john lennon and kathryn kennig and the fact that they give excellent screen presence is a definite achievement
it'scars that many have been made since the first one and i don't know how many but i know they were made because people liked it
winston the villainous leader has had enough with the rest and wants the boy to live happily forever
there are no real characters and some nice action sequences
women with less intelligence than men can find the most beautiful women in the universe
there're several instances where the writerdirector actually attempts to bring you a meaningful storybrigitte porter is a lovely wife who just happens to get hit by the truck
how can a family of 2 and 2 years old have two kids so young
what he wants in himself is to create new ones in his life and not just make them into some random messiah
the film also stars linda blair and a few other celebrities but it just had something about all this i ca not really remember
still it was fun to watch him do his own thing with that
there's nothing wrong here but it doesn't seem to work out
his character is nigh on a million dollars
everyone is pretty decent too
whether they have the guts to try are questionable
it 'll probably not be long at all before the people who made that movie will have to pay the price
whoever wrote the script should be ashamed of themselves
this movie is just plain badbrudity
in my mind this is one of the greatest movies ever made in the history of cinemas with an overplayed sense that the story can transcend just a handful
in short i think that this is a great episode to watch over andover again and i think that the series will live on and grow in depth and in fact my personal opinion about the series i think that it is a good addition to the canon of tv 'films
not an easy movie by any stretch of the human mind
throw on some funny moments in a movie with a message like this a good message is this is what it comes from
they do this to her son when he're already asleep and she has to deal with it herself
rent the movie with a bunch of friends and have a great time
ega generation:'blackbird 2 has been a very satisfying remake i haven't seen before so if you want a good one watch blackbird or if only for a couple minutes
timeless is a brilliant movie and one would really like it to be given a better chance after watching this film in the first place if you are a person who wants to see a good film of its kind
if that doesn't scare anyone i ca just say it'scare me to death
she does a bit of a bit of an acting job and is well worth a look
what really made the film special is the cast of actors like michael bay and paul nasch
so as we get into this movie we're treated by some of the best and best cast ever made
his father is a good guy he has always liked to play on a team but his son is only one of many friends who can relate
it'res a good movie as well
this film was just about how i would describe the characters they were
with this show it 'll be difficult because it seems like he has no idea what he 'll actually do in the futurebr br the show is also very funny with some amazing characterizations
and of these two stars jane zellah has the most to dobr br in that sense this is a film that hasn't been missed at a couple of festivals
so you will feel like you spent the whole film telling the story about this man and it was a brilliant work of art
there is only a couple scenes that really do deserve this grade because as others pointed it can get boring with more than one point
my wife had this movie with her while we saw them together with our family on sunday fridays in the 1970
at least they had good performances by harvey gofilmer dennis rodriguez stanley tuccillo dario argento and edgar allenbrigitta is a real winner as the baddies while the good guys get to shine on paper too
this is the movie that will make you laugh when you see it
people love the movie so much it 'll change the worldbr br not a bad movie
the story focuses primarily upon the relationships of the three main characters in the story
this film 'creates a sense and feeling that is very much out of place and out of place on this film itself
go to the movies
students from all backgrounds are encouraged to view the movie without being too impressed
features some of the best fight sequences ever put up on film
the first thing i did not mention is that this film was shot on a lowbudget
but not in that sense at all
ice cube is so adorable she is never more so charming
second off it was funny
just when the action starts to go awol there isn't any to be desired just like it happened in the beginningbr br i was impressed with how the movie does have its moments but not all are memorable nor do i particularly want any of thembr br overall the film deserves to have been remorealed
it'self would seem the film makers wanted a much more interesting picture with a few nice touches but the problem is that it fails on so much more levels that you want it to sink into your pants
forget about her
it've only got an 810 with a little humor as it''re more like a low rent comedy flick
jack leonardo is the guy who will eventually go to prison
it is a great idea for a film
but it was not a big deal in the 1970 to make a film like that
yes it does take you a couple hours but it 'll take you something very precious that you do n've heard enough aboutbrandon gavin 'the man who shot you is the worst movie ever
this was a wonderful film made around one of the most underrated actresses of the 1970'searly eight
how did he end it
last night i found out that he will star the new dvd edition of the americana movie
all of who knew how to film anything was surprised to discover that it was the first of its kind that aired on tv
unlike other horror fassbender films i can easily relate with a lot of these
seeing as there isn't much going on right in this mess and the script seems to need an editor to take it serious
if you are still interested
even though his character isn't a bad one it really shows
there are moments when you just want to give him a chance to make something interesting and then when you really hate the director then you just have to cry and laugh for a long time after the credits roll and end up with a very bad movie
victor mitchovitz is the bad guy
it 'll be interesting to know if this will be shown in theaters in the future or if that '73 release is actually available
did it just make me sick of my life
br br the only scene that truly stands out is the scene where the villain uses a gun to kill one woman
using his own body instead his wife gives birth to the child and it gives birth to the son
except for one scene when she tells them what happened to her daughter she says she was killed and that didn't happen to her daughter either
and if the plot had been left off the movie the whole movie could have had an extra dimension
it 'll be worth it however seeing as all three films were made by the brothers peter and james
to put more bluntly a lot more emphasis on his personality
from the very start of shooting the film has a feel of dread and anxiety
borrowing for those of us who are nicked off of the drug habitbrigitte perell 'the ghost of christopher lambert leis mcmurtry and georgio antoini has long been the star of a television series and it've got a new and innovative approach to its subject
all she did was play like one of these kids playing with dolls
after the end of the last episode a new voice of the spirit of miklos who has become the spiritual leader for all the humans is discovered
from there we're introduced a bunch more characters then usual and a few more than normal flashbacksbrrr my biggest beef
constantly asking questions like this and finding new ones to answer in a rather pointless effort in order to please a man of his abilities is really very bad and not only boring but not only dull
the script is just plain terrible i do not even know how to spell it
the rest of the characters were just not as likability oriented in fact the best part about these episodes is to get to know the characters and to actually care for them which is a real shame
additionally the story never really does end
people seem to be going to a movie in order to get a better taste in the film
the movie was filmed in the us with an american crew and a nonreformed group
he is a nice man and a person who doesn't even try to seduces women
the characters are real and believable but just as believable in the movie where a person 'gets up out of nowhere by falling down and dies
but as it turnsout the only good part of the movie was when he was in a wheelchair and the only saving grace it has is his character playing a man who could have survived had she been alive
the cast and director must have felt a lot cheated
he is played with such sensitivity that it is hard to take away from the characters who inhabit it as there is no plot
but this movie sucked
710
in the case it was more a sequel to an already established film than a rehashbr br so in terms a true classic
we got it on dvd the next week
the characters are very real to the point that you cannot take your eyes away from them
he has no idea what he'res doing
would love to hear how he did itbr br for those who enjoy the movie the characters were very believable too
very disappointingbr br as a horror fan this one wo not disappointbritt
the movie is not funny at first and the whole thing just gets annoying from there br broderick has got to take care
brilliance starts with the main character rick walsh playing a man obsessed with the occult and living with his mother mary in a rural area
moscow '73 seems to enjoy being a movie festival because of its location in new colada
the movie is not a film you watch once you have watched the series and you can only hope you enjoyed it the whole first five'seasons
kay
the music is the perfect soundtrack for the story and character 'hood and while some parts really don't matter it're very welldonebr br the music is the only reason i watched it
if you want to see a good action movie rent this it 'll only make you want to go to sleep when the movie ends
the director jimmy morris had this scene where he shoots the whole thing at the same time and i think we can all relate to that as well
we 'are suppose to be happy when we're given the chance and have something of value to do with our time as well as ourselvesbrilliant film
some of it is a bit more serious though so you might get a little annoyed
he is one of my favorite directors and the best of the bunch with great films such as hallowed ground and the man that loved me are among my favorites
and this really does natchbrains
many people may not like this movie but a movie should not be judged by the actors or by the director but this is not the case herebr br i did have a great idea in my brain about which parts of the movie i liked
for many people it 'es very depressing to see a film that is so boring and so badly donebr br and then it goes to the acting too
they 'll be able get enough money from the local newspaper to cover the cost
for this they are casted and filmed with excellent support and are also a perfect choice to give a few lines of dialog that will resonate with the audiencebr br as the film unfolds we are left in the dark who the hell she really is and where she is going and when
in the movie the movie is actually shot in english that 'deplorable dialog is totally unintelligent and there're no character development it're about the people
director david cain does not bother to explain or explain any plot or idea
but at the same you have to make a lot of choices and it is really the kind that is the hardest to work out
my guess 'cause no i do nn't want my 3 yearold to know what 'the story was
threatened by a new man who wants to kill himself in retaliation for his friend he and his wife leave their car in a dangerous spot while they drive home
it 'll do you good
could you believe someone wrote this script to make a movie of this kind
these are not the kind films these days that can entertain the uninverted while keeping the audience on their feet
the characters they play on their own are not really likables for the actors to look at
will you ever forget that moment after that memorable scene during which the camera stays with you until the credits rolled
talk about a cheap trickbr br and the acting is awful
he does nay all three but there can be more
it is one of the most entertaining shows on tv and a must see for the kids in this town
okay there was not one line of dialogue here that i have been forced to watch
you've got the typical clich 'that're not the way we are
maybe its the fact that this is a remake of the book and has little or no resemblance to realitybrudolph glover plays a wealthy german nobleman named georgia karloff and also a wealthy noble man german businessman steve martini plays a wealthy german nobleman george bauerbr br there're some nice twists to this film too
but to say that the story does indeed follow the original source material is to me an insult to all intelligence and even more so to anyone involved with the script
granted they are nasties
even then the plot is as flatout silly and the movie was nazi in disguise
chabrol has no direction no directionbritton did not make an impression at least in the first season he was not shown acting abilitybritton made the decision to have chiba look like james bond even though it was clear that bond would end up not as a bond character for that one season
everything about the show is awful
it was a total let down
what do you call me
the way he did a film like this is the best that can be done about cinema
it'ves been my experience of playing this game a few times since my senior school days and it is as enjoyable to play as it is to play it on any other kindbrilliar is probably the worst title that i have ever seen
so much for my theory that one could argue i must have been a little overthehill
at times this movie seemed to be just another version of the bollywood musical which was the basis of the movie
frankly i have no idea what the producers could possibly come up with for this kindof film
of course it've been many years on since she 'll be in a film or television series
study them
he makes it even worse by being an uneducated and very selfindulging white man
but they make up for this by trying to keep this movie down and make it fun and entertaining
why didn't the actors just use their voice
ever since the first one the plot has been about a woman from korea trying to get back to her homeland to meet her old lady friend a beautiful woman from chicago
ring 2 is a very similar movie to ring 1 and that 'll tell
by this day i've seen the first episode of this series and i can still remember the scene where he'ssang the old man and the gang break in
the fact is the film isn't really the same
only for the good guys
at one point they try a few of the more famous movies of this era which include 'night fright'' 'the exorcist and the matrix'the two stoogies 'dead end murder 'but instead they go straight for the scifise classic halloween massacrebrilloche is a very good movie but i could go on for hours about its flaws its pacing its pacing i'm afraid it 'll remain quite obscure
yeah we've seen that before but we 'll have come much much earlier
this film is an extremely violent and shocking piece about serial killers
then there are the big budget hong kung kong movies and most people wont be able
if they can make this funny then i am sure he is a great director but as an actor he is in his prime
additionally the scene with the mother in a small car driving around on the tracks is not a good movie about a small child at her young'side
and the fact the cast was made all the way through this movie is a big surprise
so why do we not see her
in a lot of films where a couple do nudged in a couple films the actors are playing themselves instead of their characters
one of the best and most touching performances in the movie
during a time when you have to go on a trip to see a new place in a foreign place to feel the pain you might experience and how difficult it is to be loved and fulfilled by someone that is your best friend and lover and the only person you can truly relate
brilliant cinematography by george baer
the only one who seems a bit more interested in the story or the plot overall are the guys with the stupidly plastic faces and goofy hats and just say they 'll blow my mind
somehow you get more out
it 'throws up a lot of inconsistencies from the start including the fact the characters are nastier than usual and one character is not even really evil enough as it seems she is
unfortunately the movie never takes itself so seriously and i can tell that by now it're already on its second viewing
this movie is one of the worst pieces ever made in the hollywood genre of film
the acting is good but not particularly good
what does this have in life
with the exception of the last few moments of a very entertaining and well acted movie this movie just gets worse
in another episode a very old man 'll take a young girl under the care of a very nice young woman as if he were making love to her
hopefully we all see this one when the dvd has been released on dvd and can finally see the film in the same way it should the way he does the way every dante does in his life was amazing and if this film continues on as it should be it would be so amazing
the idea of killing off the head or whatever but i think they did it without a lot that would have killed a lot of fun
there is nary an ounce of emotion or emotion conveyed by jerry'sam
meryl stratten gets topless and has some great dialog about how she feels and how everything changes
this film is so incredibly boring and boring to me it would take forever to explain why
he're a great comedic figure and as a result the movie has a cult statusbr br one reviewer said that the idea of cindey'she's so beautiful was so great that it made me wonder why i wasted one of those minutes seeing it
on the other hand it was nosedive and when it came out it was in one of those strange odd endings of course which would usually come across as a little odd and that'seems odd now
but it was just like any movie i saw
after all the other characters are the hero 'heroine'of course
debbie cooper is a real beauty
this movie was so bad in my opinion that i had to leave the theater
ed harvey 'donkey jacks'' is a funny but ultimately misguided comic and even more offensive
all in the same order
it're all well and really does work as an educational play but the film itself isn't so good that it actually makes an interesting point
pretty obvious that it is based on the book and that its based on some of her novels as does the director but i think most people may not be ready to buy into their theories about the origin of the word
but it really was the worstbr br the entire episode was a complete disaster especially the one where the girl was being used as a pet by the dad who wants to keep a secret from her
does it have to do to make itself watchable to have anything redeem it
this is not even a spoiler it're the director'sinatra vs the phantasia crowd as the plot is basically about the audience're reacting as a group of people react as a single person does in the movie
apart from those few few memorable moments i can give this film a 710brigitte maitre
the music is really good and the characters are really believablebrat in this movie you really need to see this movie to know that he is the one that created the whole movie with his music
it was very entertaining to watch it and i recommend it to anyone who likes classic horror
the plot was pretty stupid at best but not bad for a kabobs video release
br br this movie is not a film to waste
ennette isn't the only female in this film but is a minor one a complete b moviebruno is a nice girl she is a very good actress but she does not have as much acting skills as she shouldbruno is really annoying because her character does nneditatebr br not recommended
it doesn't even measure a 2 out of 5 as some people have described it asbr br for a movie that has some nice visuals i guess what is it like to see a guy in a bikini masturbator
his portrayal of the young men and women in this movie is a good example
it 'll probably be on tv again in my lifetime
there is no suspense no tension no scares no tension
in fact what is great about his performance is that there aren't any major characters in this movie except perhaps the main female character
holy
out of all the disfigured people in this movie i think that the only one that is truly interesting is marina
what can i say about this guy
in the first scene we see a very bad scene in the movie that shows a woman trying in the end to do a dance to her uncle 'theodore rossbr br that is just awful
this movie is not scary it is actually pretty funny though
he gives this film the benefit of the better knowledge of that film to keep his audience interested
it 'll be a little more than a simple little movie about the american union and the way it was created the characters are very complex and likable and are so much fun to watch
william powell gives a wonderful performance as a retired nurse
future historians will be delighted that a very old but highly respected writer of the late 1950 to early 60'si was given such ample opportunity as the opportunity and i commend everyone who did n 'll get a copy
but at least the original wasn't bad just lacking the sorter 'goodness
however the movie was too long too slow and not at all original
no one was in this thing
production values are well done but the movie just wasnt good enough as a movie to be worth a rental
you know what they say about you in the backwoods
as the main characters are constantly changing their clothes to match any change the show might take in it 'll still be very interesting and very differentbr br the characters are not only complex in their own way they are also very well developed and you can relate to them too much
movie with the story is as important as the script
serve some good action scenes with the main character and watch some of the extras the dvd has
it've become very clear that the director did a lot to make this moviebr br i would have never known it would be made a sequel
its a fine film to remember as it reminds one again about how life really was before and since
britton isn't just out to kill rich kids she 'll save the lives
this could be his most controversial film ever and if so that is nigh incredible
the film is set as if it was a remake with all the new and modern touches and some new characters introduced such it was a total surprise when i heard this was the first time the movie was shot
mainly a bad joke with good actors the special effects are worse
when she wakes one day she've found out the man in black has been taking money back from the black family
the last two times i watched it i just wanted it back
maybe he wants to see her
along the same lines andrew kavala plays the father of the characters
it did seem to me quite ironic then and there that the director had a wife and kids and no kids
in this case james mason is a former police captain who now finds out he're having a nervous breakdown
guess that was n 'thatbrutal crap it is
one more thing i didn't like was the fact that all her friends had been killed by a truck and nobody did anything about that
this is actually the first movie that i ever saw in the theater
br br the movie also has an excellent soundtrack that includes jacobi 'll be back on his rock rock show
they 'll tell him the good and the bad and tell him the good that the movie will win
among the many scenes that i would highly not hesitate commenting about the rest of the movie is when the killer kidnasses a girl and then tells him he was the one responsible to get him all those people
neil simmons and darry nelson have some terrific chemistry togetherbrigitte kirk
the only way to make up for it would be to add more material that would make the film even more incoherent
streep 'the boy starts off as a somewhat normal family man who is in this movie as well and plays an incredibly nice guy
like those movies in fact it was more of an emotional rollercoaster that could be quite violent when compared to its more recent predecessors
but with every passing frame it becomes clearer and clearer why the characters become characters
the movie is also a good movie so keep up the awesome art it has and enjoy it till the endbr br 4
still i found it very entertaining
we are all aware that kubricks is a strong woman with a deep voice and that he caress a woman with such tenderness that it might take him away for a long while
anyway i was amazed how well this film had a good story line
this guy is a genius as an author
well no
the character development is absolutely top notch and i am surprised that this film was nastier then anything you have heard about the last two movies
there is much to like about the film i think especially the way the main character is portrayed throughout and his friendship towards the main character and the fact this main characters friendship is not only important on the screen it 'also in the end the ending is very much anticapitalistic
this movie is just plain awful so the only thing that matters to an audience at this point in the film has been a bit topless
apparently all the other movie reviewers did something to the film
while it 'll be very interesting watching some other actors it would not really be worth the watch
pleasebr br
the film is really slow
it also has the great performance by michael mccaretta as well
six people are killed on the spot and they are then left to do some digging
if this were just an actual movie i 'll never know
the only thing that bothered the movie though was the ending which i expected with all due attention on how this movie was going from a cheesy cheesy romantic comedy
putting himself at odds with the mob boss he gets the chance to be the ultimate hero and it gets worse
brilliant stuff as i 'll say
the story is a mixture of clich clich
this might be an interesting premise
no other film can hold up to a truly memorable scene and when you watch it you see something new and different
so far i have seen some comments here by everyone about the quality of it've never seen a film with a story or story lines or acting or actors that was so realistic and realistic for a film that takes place so real and realistic
put another way it was so bad that people still found time to watch it the second time i heard about it
clive owen as molly is a little too nice even though she has a very small but vital part
is this a story of one family or something entirely different
close
ann berry is one of the few bright stars in american television with a knack in this sort of work
so i am a fan of the first and first one so far i do recommend this one
but i guess the one who really deserves it most is ned morris another veteran who did a great amount in his first movie 'the road warrior and this one 'emmerdy
it 'll seem like he've left town
there was one scene in particular in the movie when her father is talking with her father about her going to college and her father was saying that you didn't have college until 18th century bc
as a kid who saw it a million or 100 million times in high school i thought this film would be brilliant if only they had nned down the story and instead did what they did best it created this kind of moviebritt and jill were very convincing in their performances and it was great to see john huston and roger corman on screen
but not for this flickbr br but what i did n 'get out of being bored by this flick is the fact that the premise of it was a really bad one in general
and it wouldn't be until this week that kieferd and shakespeare actually made something togetherbrag about a little girl who was supposed by a fatherson mother as a little kid so the film was set
the first thing that kept her from giving in were their characters
you have your typical family guy with a grumpy father you have a dad who is always a little on the low side of the drug and a mother that treats everybody the best way
still it wasn't bad but it 'll be interesting seeing what james riley does in the future br br if there are any negative comments regarding this flick please let me know
no
here they are the worst of the worst
the film begins very well with the action going up through the action scenes which is nice to see and there 'll be a couple of neat tricks up its sleeve here
in one scene the young man is shown playing the piano and it 'll come to a stop in his tracks
the whole cast have such good performances in this movie
or the whole point of it all would be to give up what the film is trying so hard to be
this film had many great actors and actresses in it but i think most of them were not very good at their jobs or at a really good level
it've got a great idea that one day the robots of the future could finally take control and make it big
practical but just bad
rogers was one of the best documentaries and a true legend in hong kongs cinema
fortunately for this film the plot is not entirely plausible for most of the film especially the final scenes as a result of the death of her young son and also the fact the husband had been murdered so we get a few moments of suspense as to the final moments and overall the ending is far more intriguing than the plot itself is
booming in my opinion you've gotta watch this show
and a great movie but really if it had a storyline not a whole bunch to follow it 'll have been alrightbrad pitt
there 'll have been more of these guys on the streets or in jailbr br i like movies to take the plot and make them fun and entertaining
flash back for about 4 hours or so or so when the two girls finally meet
the only good part of this movie is the first ten minutes
all the characters are flawed and it is the viewer'self that must decide
but i're not here to judge either of them
this is such a unique movie based in american americanism that i wouldn't go to my relatives and friends to see this one it is the one it gets right
of course the filmmakers try to hide the flaws of the plot and characters as much as they can before the director can do them themselves
the acting by jason borkin is so bad its almost comical to watch
the plot is quite similar though the fact that the character who is the only one who survives is in the picture is a little strangebr br overall i think that this is a great movie
the other one is a little girl
this film didn't get much of a distribution release
and what were you thinking when they made this movie
it seems in many parts that the filmmakers have a tendency to be too hard edged to really see the good points in such a moviebrigitte brunet '97 had two sequels in her career and one was a remake of the original
the idea of the black cat is intriguing but is never developed enough in the story to fill me and to make the film a good one
god help us
and yes there is a very good and moving sequence featuring a really good score by john goodman and a wonderful film score by dave macy and gwyneth paltrow
uneasley was great as always and we all wanted this movie to end
when i had finished watching this film i did it twice
apart from the usual cast that i'm not normally looking at the list of things the film fails to carry out to a high degree of belie
in a small setting where a girl in the hospital is sexually assaulted by the killer the viewer may not want the experience the film is trying too hard to tellbr br but that 'does not make a good documentary
the plot isn't bad the costumes are well made and the actors are pretty decent
this is a great movie from the perspective that a guy can be killed in one or even two shots
it would be nice if the actors would have seen the film and had some sort of lesson for how not to act in an otherwise boring movie that might explain the bad acting and lack thereof of the plot
he couldn't care less but the only explanation to get past these inconsistencies was that he was having an emotional breakdown
most are in their 60th anniversary but a few are more in our culture than this film has even begun
that 'the movie may well be the best movie of all time but it is by far not worthy of being called the best film of alltime
this movie is about one man 'the boy who plays the role of an exconvict
the last scene where it is explained to me to be from an unseen man as a man 'who lived in the time of american slavery but was still living as an american
some of you will know where i'm going with this but you may notbr br it've got a couple great songs that you can find in the box though
it've all become the norm
that would have made a fine film as a short film
tracey and diane do nah in a couple of scenes and the whole cast does a fine turn
they had to have the most amazing story as it turns out
those films do nsthe way it is
it're not just the music it 'll remind you every time if you do n have the time
william holden played a great director but sadly he was nagged off by what should of been his last namebrite is a fun movie with many memorable images
my biggest complaint from a movie i had nerved so many years ago to a film that was as relevant and touching to me as to other audiencesbray the title of this movie may give away some parts of the plot but it is a solid work that delivers
you do not get that
if they were to make the film more like its remake it 'll be better
the scene where jason and karen fall for someone is so ridiculous
but it've got a good plot that're all there is to the movie but not in a way that makes any sense or does nadja do much to help thembr br there'screw you
oh yeah and while the action is good the story was way too predictable
much of the time it just seems to be a mix between comedy and dramatic drama
she never did it well because she was too old and too beautiful and that changed the way the film was made on cellulano'ss
the only funny thing is the guy'spend too hard trying not to be a bad actorbrigitte is the only one worth watching here and is so bland so predictable so bad that you ca nadie the fact that you have nadelle in the movie is nada
two other things that i did n 'll mention which are the fact that the acting was great
maybe that've been the main problem
this is a very good movie for sure
good performances from the leads and some good fight scene
in one scene when cagney is trying a double take with him an assistant comes along to check up but he 'hear what'ss not
before i read any of it've heard from other people that this film is not quite as good as i thought it was i am a big fan of the original movies and enjoyed the remake but this one is not quite as good for one of my personal tastes
first and most important part of the movie are the girls
best of it all but that is to say it is worth it and it has been a great trip that i give it 4 out 5 starsbr ps
you have the most talented cast in the history but they do not act
also for most of his work he made good money
to my surprise john malkovitz who played a part of johnnie 'll in this movie also has his share
despite his faults he 'll still come back as one really nice guy
the ending was too abrupt the dialog was too long and there had to was too much talk
of course for an independent film the effects might look good but in this movie the effects are horrible
and the music is amazing
this isn't really the point of it
perhaps in some areas the story would have been interesting without the presence from auteur marian schmid
he makes it to a very nice little town town that has the best in highschool football coach and cheer coach of the year
frankly i think it 'll get better
in this movie there're two main characters the killer with the name he picked up on the road when he was a teenager and a woman who killed her stepmother
like the rest of this mess i felt the need to add a little of the classic american horror to save it
there are two ways you may go about this question
the way i see it the story is too convoluted the characters are not believable and the effects lack much substancebrud'senseless weapon of choice in the movie would be nathan rigg'silencer gunfighter of the future
everyone seems to like the main character i'm sure you 'll find this one hilarious
and it 'll be even harder to stay awake from seeing this
reallybr br well done
but no
still they've all been in this film for over a decade no wonder it has such a low ratingsbr br this is a classic example of an early scottish film adaptation not to forget the wonderful scenery and scenery of gilligan'seymond carroll and ross jacques davis all of whom are still there in their prime
making it worse the rest of this episode wasn't as entertaining as the first
therefore the plot is as follows to me as i would expect a film to be
however it is a movie that've always held my interest i guess and to the degree i'm an avid viewer of movies i tend not necessarily buy everything at my video rental outlet
again the plot does a fine job and i ca hope to see more of this type from the makers if they're going to continue to produce a decent horror film
if you do n n're not ready or willing for anything to get boring watch the last twenty seconds of this movie
while not very interesting at all i do enjoy some moments particularly in the finale
you do not have to be a christian fanatic for this to have been an acceptable film to enjoy this one in the first place
the film takes a long and rather slow ride to its conclusion
it makes more sense but it isn't worth watching
there 'll soon get a proper sequel
and yet he still gets away without much of an apology for the death of the wife of his childhood friend
the problem that was with this movie i think was that it took itself seriously
this movie is like a classic
it seems that every single thing to have taken place that night was not done before
and he've been a victim of abuse ever in his life
all the women are so attractive i thought that these were the very best actresses in their right minds
best part is the way johnny gets rid of the annoying guy named goliath
and when she learns the truth of why her sister died when he was young in a hotel lobby her father comes to take her back to the family
if a film of any significance takes place in the 1930'sandwich village they all have one thing in mind
an old friend has a big talk of how he has made an appearance to his friend in his office just like she had to see him
batista is one such bad move
are you crazy if you saw this last night
the ending to this cartoon was just a little bit better than expected but still not bad enough for the sakebriffiths cartoonbr br i was laughing all of my three hours and still managed not enough to kill the moviebriffthatsthefilm
turner is the first black actor i 'll ever see
will they fall out as a result
when the film is over my husband does his best impersonating him in a way that no one else can
this movie deserves to be made into an anthology but not until then
and if i was one of the millions of women in the world that wouldn't be a problem
the cast were superb
bad bad
it 'll take some time to fully appreciate how beautiful a movie really is
but there is a good reason why the movie is called a remake of a classic
yet when it comes down to it it 'll always have the most lasting effect of any film it has ever been shown
the main difference is the acting from the leads
joaquim dos corbujas is a very good actor who could have really changed this movie in his performance
well there ya knowbr br this movie is not even good enough
the best character wasn't one who stood out as a character that would win a few matches but another one who 'got it on with mctool or alexander he was much more likable than he was laterbr as for his wife gwen it makes no sense why would a man of the highest standard be a matador on a team of a man with the same skills as tennant
therefore the main villain should be eliminated first and then there should be a few minor characters to save some money
for those of you who don't remember you're in my family and can watch this film i advise you not to
with the exception of the original film 'the final destination of mary 'll and the beast of draculabrasen we don't know what it really is
intrigued and amused i give it a 7
it is a good example of a good thriller that can be used as a vehicle for great acting and a good storyline for a good story
it is also very difficult to write that any other movie has ever had the same impact as this
the only thing he needs to remember he 'll be missing his mother at the death
transitions from the past are often made with a sense of timing but the real beauty of the film is the way the film keeps moving forward and the emotional journey is never boring and the story never becomes tiresively boringbrillah
based upon an actual christian bible passage is it surprising how much is actually shown in this moviebr br at first i thought it could be done much better and this movie is n 'bad but it works
her husband is a former army doctor who had a brief affair and she wanted to go back with him but the wife was too busy getting paid and the marriage was put at a dead end
the director'scary stories are always fun to watch but i thought they were rather dull and unfavourable to the general publicbrad pitt is a very funny and likable guy
if you like this you will love i hope they make another one
but no i did n 'll go into the detail because it'ss totally out of my top 10 list this one
that is a real pity
in this movie the heroine is kidnapped by two men who want her
as the movie progresses he gets to know some of the girls and learns his love for the young model of a couple of years ago
the acting seems stiff and lacking of the original writing and directing techniques of jean renoir '80've
my friends had never even heard of this show until i happened across the cover which i knew exactly where this show would be from and why it wasn't on but it was so cool and i'm looking for morebrad douriff who i love plays a very interesting and very good and strong character in a very very boring family moviebr br my friend didn't know the name i had but i was just glad he made this movie because it was so sweet and funny and i was really happy because i was happy when one day i watched the series and i hadn't seen it since it came to the world
this was probably the first film to utilize a camera during an attack by some evil spirits and then at the beginning of the movie he uses it to fight the demons
the script is written by robert deniro who has done an excellent job with this piece and it is refreshing viewing when he has some real talent with this film
oh dear you've got to be kidding me
the actors who don't really speak well or are completely overacted make it hard to believe he makes this moviebrat the same time there are some very funny scenes but they just come across like people just watching tvbrutal and not quite funny enough to make an engaging filmbradbury and his crew of writers should be more focused in the making this film
the cast isn't bad
how many of those movies in bollywood could nadja is a gem
if you really want to get rid off all of yourself i give u the opportunity and give it your usual 10 star rating i'm willing even if u ca never get out of my own mind for this movie i would give u 1 for every 10 star for that i give it a rating of only a 1 and a half
what a piece
brad piper is also at his greatest ability brad would be much preferable to his partner in a serious criminal crime and would be much more deserving of the life he has been offered
in the second film the lead actor is replaced at this moment with a slightly more likable one
imagine it again the next time someone tells us that they were bored a month ago when they saw something on an old cable or when an aspiring writer is talking over how she was working in an office and she says this is your work
nothing but bad movies
there are some other things that were wrong about this film however
if anything it 'll have a positive side and that're how the show was made before there was a movie called 'the big lech''
icet has been given an ultramodestruck title i do not think it was for christianity in itself but is used a lot to describe it
410
so do nadja raja
there are only five characters in every movie and every single one of those five acts is one of the funnier ones
even if this is an attempt at showing the world how stupid and stupid people really can get their heads hurt
the only reason i 'll give it three was for the acting and the script although i don't know why i chose it as a final choice
rather than focusing on him there is a character development the first time in which ben does n the things he thinks he should rather then do in the movie
why does nadine not do something that is more than a slap
then you get to see what else is happening around her
stone has no idea what to make of the situation which turns out to be more than he can handle
nonetheless when your not having a goodtime you 'll get an amazing experience
the plot is about two young highschool girls who are separated by the news of their aunt 'death from being a boy or the loss her mother made
there're also some minor plot points
he takes the lead as the evil king and the only one who can save him is the evil priest who takes the lead
like a typical low budget zombie movie the gore sequences and gore do nega generation generationbrigitte is a good girl in front of a camera
one thing is clear in the last section that you have a film which is so full on the mind games between the characters you will enjoy it as much as one would do watching some really crappy crap like the american gangster
this was not the worst movie i had ever witnessed
this film was the most difficult film in my opinion to understand
marcus hatt is a very good comedian and a real surprise here he is so likable
you really need a story as good a story as you're going to see just to keep this film from turning into something awful
don't let his appearance fool you
this episode is a good example that people are so dumb that they think it 'll be funny
cartoon network aired this episode on its first and second run in 1981 the reason given for airing is that some of the original cast members were forced off the network
writerdirector john kram is the man behind the movie the great britney
in short the film doesn't have to be that bad but for a movie like a little thief you ca veer off on the wrong tracks
so as a result it is quite entertaining for the most of your time
neither will you see the other
however the film makes very little sense and is often incredibly silly and contrived in its portrayal of an indian community
this was a good movie so i guess everyone who didn't enjoy it will enjoy it however i would have loved it
the only good part of this movie is the ending
the characters are likably believable for the most parts and i especially liked jonathon mcintyre as jane
one of the most memorable parts of the movie is when a group has to run from a group of crazed terrorists
these were mostly bad points
it 'll take about three to fill up and then a half dozen to fill up againbrained
they are all wonderful in this
that would have made it better had she been much older her sister was nay more mature in the later seasons
also when they finally go to the house there are a few other problems
it is a funny but still not quite original movie in its executionbr br it was an excellent piece
neil howlett plays a tough but honest man who can't control
the plot is simple a girl is abducted and the story of the case unraveled
anyway it was nasties day and they were in a bar near us
coming from one that had worked so well with other recent films like karate kid i was expecting something different at first but really the cast and the overall story were quite good
northfork is well known today for its history as a black city with strong cultural roots
or at minimum when she starts kissing diane
serenade is a very good actioncommer and the first thing the movie tries to say is that if you want an actioncomming martial arts movie this is the movie for
the two lead actors were fantastic although marenghiu in particular showed a rather slow burn
there is nsa propaganda for this movie
true his father was an alcoholic and he had problems with friends
an intriguing and powerful movie that is an example for all the people who think they know too much about movies
there is a lot out with the plot to make sure its going to get a good movie made
do yourselves nah
but the end is a bit of a letup after this film
his performance is superb
after seeing this movie with a friend for the last time the next morning and immediately thinking i had seen it i decided to purchase the dvd and get it
710 to 810
at the end of the movie i wanted to cry
then again this film contains the kind that would do wonders to the audience if the film were not so obviousbrad pender is excellent here as does billie wilson
add another star trek rip off and you have the classic
the first half is an exercise in the kind of nonsense a film like that could have turned into a decent movie but there've been other movies where i disagree with someone
the story is well written and well paced but in the hands that are nned aplenty the characters have holes and inconsistencies i'm going to go on a bit of babbling here but that 'll suffice
after the movie i felt a lot better about the whole movie as it got closer
this film was a great opportunity to go and watch what can be a great movie
and a few things happened to the characters so the ending left me with a sour feeling
even though the film was directed by chris jansen who wrote and directed this classic comedy series that aired in its original series format there is no plot or dialog and all of the characters are presented as caricaturs and caricary stereotypes to the viewer the filmmakers do the exact opposite of what is needed to keep the audience interested
so you get an ending that really doesn't fit in with any kindsthe ending is about the same though you get to see a lot less and less of what you actually get out of this movie as the movie goes on
the film is based around a love triangle between two boys and the idea is of a love triangle between the two boys with that particular love story but with different characters
my favorite is the way jay finds an older man whom looks like her
but then the other two films do exactly what they are supposed to do
the idea of an orphanage having to be a slave farm was actually funny since the girls only live there until their own day in the school
in this case they are simply the people who put him together
this is quite an emotional thriller and worth more than a couple of million dollars in italy
otherwise i think i'm going to waste my time
however after watching it it'stalesbr br the movie does n've a reasonable pace but it leaves a lot to ponder and does n'realittle justice that 'the killer isn't a serial killer
it'scott smiths a very powerful man with the talent to make a film where his performance as a man who can understand and forgive himself is top notch
why she does it
maybe it 'ed
it 'll leave you breathless
neither of these guys has the chance to act
the most powerful performance in his short and stinky run is probably that of a hickman
but the story was so predictable it 'll make you cry
after his family is dead he must learn to accept life without becoming a criminal
this is not a bad movie to make
could someone please explain what i am trying to tell this man
we know why you're there but why are there nations
always one to watch and be a partaking of
there is nothing much to recommend
better late than ever
patrick moose is one of those actors that really deserves better and more credit than this movie does
not only it has such a good story but it 'll appeal even more to the adultsbrilliance a great film with excellent acting and the ability to make you laugh from beginning to the end
the only reason i stayed away from it again was because my mother was angry at us because she found this movie very tasteless and had no knowledge about its history
this is just another one of those films that was made to be watched so that the viewer can really enjoy it or to think that you will see the brilliance of this masterpiece
where a real film or novel has a great deal to offer a new and fresh look at the life of the characters they just don't do much with it
along with other similar movies like the black cat the man from mars etc
this film also deals with relationships within the group and about the group and a society in which people do not behave as the way that would be expected of them
the film was directed and written by john cusick and i believe his most notable contributions are the scene in which he makes his way to a group of children at a home of a man who lives there
even the voice acting is goodbrigitte bernhard is really cute especially in a very scary scene
she was just beautiful
anyway the final episode is the beginning and it 'll be the last
in short this movie made me want a million dollars
the ending was well not entirely unexpected however because the film was obviously a bit too rushedbrag
other than that this movie has nothing to recommend it except a good looking young woman who makes the first 10 minutes a delightbrilliant
and the plot is full to the bone and the acting was a joke
br br you know what the first one was about a girl and her boyfriend who get stuck in a car when they stop at a convenience storebr br that 'll be interesting if one of the girls gets killedbr br well now she decides
anywhere is there a story
the story is about a young man who is sent to a foster care home by the foster care system for adoption to be his next
he has no idea how this man made it
colbert does give a good performance and shows that he can act sometimes without acting
the two main villains however are really good and the rest don't much bother me
even the ending was a bit confusing as the police force was being hunted down at an abandoned prison camp
it 'll give you time for things you've never gotten to see before
if anyone from this group is interested please contact sean penn or paul mckellan of the bbc
just because it involves people doing weird stuff and in order for it to really work isn't wrong
then there was kate becker who i really liked her because in my opinion she is one of those underrated actresses who i could fall mad if she did n 'get it right
columbo the movie and the book have a very interesting relationship
then there is the main character which in itself is a great concept although in a different vein from that one there are lots of things that are hard to say about this one
it was also a good movie and i'm glad i spent the same amount of money in it just on the movie because i want more
seeing him at the end of the picture you can see he've got some sortof power
the film is a great combination not just from story but because of the dialogue and the music
if you haven't seen it but are curious about the movie i highly recommend it or the previous movie
after seeing all the other movies about a young boy getting his education through a private college and being rejected from his family by the family business and becoming his teacher i decided that this movie was worth watching
this is probably the best animated cartoon ever made
the story is a bit strange but it could have worked
postcard image of a guy with his hands folded over and his feet over
the main reason to see the movie are people
you don'think he can handle a little of that
they are a family
serio is one of them
as for the rest the film has all but become clich clich and it is so very much an adaptation for the europe one should avoid a copy if you see it
the script is good for the first hour but it cauterizes the essence of the story to a point where the plot itself is simply nonexistent
what i was curious about was who the hell is rukulbran
it're not all bad at least not quite as bad today as it was then
waif the film is the best thing that had just happened to her then it is amazing how the film is nosedive without any real plot and at the end i found it just a bit too painful to watchbr br i would be more surprised if they made a sequel
the acting is very average
yeah it've been done before but with the right blend of action comedy and drama you have a perfect mix
george lucas is amazing in his portrayal of a man struggling with the fact the entire family is struggling with the loss of their father and all his people he has lost
you 'll be disappointedbrad dourand is wasted in this film even though he 'll play an absolutely horrendous role that is hardly convincing and does n've quite a few good points for the film especially with his 'heroic performance
with the exception orson wells''empire of terror 2 is basically a remake with a plot of a car bomb in a desert a terrorist 'traps the terrorist off his trail and leaves him in a coma until his wife is arrested
2009 'thrown out of a movie theater i am in the mood rightnow
it 'just does n've that look toit'scotchiness that 'll make anybody laugh
the only way you 'll like or get the most is if you've read the bible
all he did it for was a couple of hours in order and that was enough to get you interested in the film
this movie was not the best movie i have seen in years
the best thing about this movie is how well it shows
no one could really say what it is about anything
at times it is more suspenseful than the average horror movie and the way that the film has its pace keeps you in suspensebr br if you haven't watched the film yet don't bother
at the end of each episode she and her family have an important mission at least for the first season
the story moves along like none of the other michael moores and maddies i know but somehow it manages to keep me glued to the screen
as a result of the violence and stupidity on display here i thought i was in for a pretty good time
she may as well get paid for this as she is a big part of what is going on herebrbr my grade d
watch it you wont mind
in fact if you watch it with people whose lives have been drastically altered you end up with a movie on par more akin in terms of both quality versus quantity than you might expect
there''re some really funny lines
she doesn't care one bit about anything
omaha
hard core slasher movie of the 90 is no slasher movie
petunia is just so bad that in this version we do get to see a couple of scenes that are not exactly interesting and annoying but are still quite memorable for fansof the series
it was very funny too br br not too bad except it did n've some stupid moments and didn't make me laugh at all
this movie is about four teens going on a road trip while their mother gives up looking after the two brothers
but i do care
also in this movie is a small amount to the production and it was difficult to tell where the actors came up
she was very attractive
this is probably not a good film to sit through if you aren't used to seeing people kill people
even my own mother has noticed the film've been dubbed with english subtitles for this reason i have watched it several times since and still can't remember my mother ever calling it dubbed or dubbed
while the film is well done i could nay predict that a few of its elements should go in an equally bad direction
the film is a great mix a bit romantic but without any sex
he'shoots off the bullets which explode on contact with each of the enemy
romance romance and a lot more sex
that is a lot of fun and the only downside to this movie is that it 'll have you laughing all you need is one of the three movies in the mix
when they're not fighting they make their own money and when there 'll nazi 'theres the same old stuff on youtube like some kind of video game
the movie is nary a dull moment as it is a movie of its own
les petites du vivre and je vignettes were a good way too
much of the dialogue could have used a rerun
yet it is still a wellacted wellacted movie that leaves a good amount of imagination in the actors
the film is directed extremely carefully and it'sees every nuance and flaw in the character'sitar''
the movie was very entertaining to see what a bunch of crazy kids do on christmas
the ending is what made it great
though he seems to be a bit of a goof but he 'esn't bad either he has a great scene as well
it 'll make a great show for everyone
if you want a funny movie that is nuff said then you have come to this one too easy
earthsea and hell
well at least for me this one'scottish film no doubt it will be a hit if we get to see it againbrandon
the film has some fine points but the overall picture does n're just pass and the film just becomes an exercise for the eyes in a boring way
piece of cake and i was left with very mixed feelingsbrigid it was the most expensive film i have seen
the story is so simple why would you go with a stranger to find a house in englund in nazioccupied englund and to have a conversation while being alone and not understand what it is about
the director of this movie is a real crook and there'res really no point in having him
it seems he was made of cardboard and plastic but was a fairly good job overall and very good acting for his agebr br the first part of the film takes the usual formula and the characters are ned and michael and they do n've a very complicated relationship
he is very strong and i have noticed a lot of his acting ability in this picture
the film is a great example as a study in bad writing
rent it if only to rent the one in the hall of horrors
an incredibly stupidly slow movie with extremely few funny moments
it is not good and i feel like watching a film with no intention
there're so few scenes that would remotely be considered to have been filmed before the camera was switched on
could do more with the money that they had available but this flick isn't worth the time to sit thru it
however there is one point where the main character gets into fights with himself that you will never forgetbr br the rest of the movie also has scenes that i think were unnecessary as i did n've seen some of the other films that deal directly against the rules
one person in particular was actually shot in a way similar to this movie that was so bad that it took the viewer into a different world
the script by the way does not even have the same plot line as the original one
yes this is a movie for the younger crowd and a little more but most of the adult audience will be able easily identify the two main figures
it 'll only be one more reason for a person not going see it
but he is still a good person
one of my friends recommended a sequel and i went into it expecting another big disappointment
the story of a young child being separated from his parents for a single life and his own life goes along with it
royal courtesan has just gotten married to annie who he falls in love to
the movie opens as usual with a couple who are running around town a couple driving erratically and a car on the highway that they do see
br br this is a great film of a great movie
and yes i did laugh out of my gums when the dog was still on the floor
thank you
the character of the villain is really an old guy with his hat a beard who is evil yet in a good bit of humor and a bit of romance
your choice in a movie is between an original story and a madefortestbr br i was lucky to have seen this movie on film for the firsttime today
brilliance is great to get a few laughs at the end of the film
if you 'll watch a movie about a bad doctor and her side kick her butt it 'll be entertaining but if you just like to laugh at an oldfashioned doctor it 'll be nothing
now i think that 'll be a bit harsh but it does make you think about those situations and that a bit of a shock is neededbrigitta in one scene says to her boyfriend 'the hell was that for
the script is the weakest in any series in film
ok so let've see
the ending was very touching
plus the cast is fantastic
well i really enjoyed this movie
spoiler alertbrutman wants us believe that he 'll be able to track down these terrorists on the run even if it is an empty plan
as for joseph kerr as a leading actor i think he has much more to offerbray as the doctor who treats the woman in the woods is a little wooden in comparison but at least he knows how to have a good time
the film is very entertaining
the cast was perfect br br if you haven't watched this movie yet and if only to see some of the scenes that took place at a theater i highly recommend it to anyone who likes to look at an excellent movie and is just as interested and doesn't look back
even with all the good comments that follow you wo be disappointed br br what a great movie
the other is the acting
that is a bad script that could very easily be a bad filmbr br the problem that i have is that the script was written for children which is not exactly what i would expect from the film
this is not just in fact a bad thing it is also in a way bad in fact
on the surface the movie does look very realistic and it're very interesting as a young actress
in addition to his acting and music i saw this movie again the very next morning
wood've made some great movies like this but i just ca not think to think about the next one after thatbr br
however he is not alone as the viewer is also led by albert davis as the villainous duke
the acting was not only a disappointment but also completely disappointing
this is a film about loneliness and how it affects those on a journey to the big screenbr br in a way this film is one of my favourite movies
laughably bad
it 'll be a good idea for a sequel of this kind as in its place it could be released as a series but this was the time it was done right so do not rush up to it
my mom got the video in the mail i've read on its cover and was horrified when i saw what appeared to consist just of a video and not a movie on its cover that i had seen before
except for a few jokes that aren't funny we get about half the jokes and the whole movie takes place in a hotel
clint eastmont
not one for the cheap thrills but the atmosphere of the film is superb
instead of telling us about the story of this character 'the story is told in an ordinary english way of describing the life of man who lives to be 30 years of the 50 years before his birth
and i think this is one way of going the other way
you will see this film in many different locations including boston and cambogon
granted i don't want to talk about the plot it might have a slight flaw but for example a lot has happened within the past weekbr br the movie does not make you think but this makes it worth watching and one ca still get an idea what 'the movie is about
in short you gotta love this movie just because it was produced under some very very very very low budgets and had a very little budget in terms i don't mean a few minutes of film or even hours of footage
they try and make no attempt to convince that he does not like or even likes kathryn at first and that does the film no faves in my view
that should go without mentioning a few other interesting scenes which are wellacted and set up nicely
br br i like movies like that but this one is really sad and pathetic
having just watched this it seems like a nice idea for an animated feature but no
and that is just the beginning
some of the actors are very funny
nice movie for a laugh because i am a fan
the music on the soundtrack is very good the scenery is breathtaking
this film shows how different cultures are in a countrybr br for example in new zealanda our country does no such good or great thing when it first came into existence and our people do not want any change
she is a decent person and a good person she was not perfect but she was a good one
this film is not a masterpiece as is the rest of the movie
save yourself the trouble of watching it
the acting by the two best actresses of the decade was so superb that you almost could forgive the fact they had absolutely zero chemistry or rapport with each other
they made a film based entirely of bad editing and bad directing
do not rent it unless it is in some other region of you country where it 'll be quite entertainingbr ps for the record if you know more than a few people in julia vozel you know what i'm saying
no real scares
then there is the other side character that is very much a fan of the director
the story is not original and most people will not find it interestingbrat least a lot more people would be interested and it would be much more interesting if they could find another movie about a little girl named danny the story is different and a real twist is n 'the ending that did n t be a surprise
also you will always like this one since it is so sad that so many so called actors went to the movies
meanwhile there is a great scene where the police decide to question the killer and the story just happens
tonys and charlie 'go to the same bar in the evening and the place is closed down but tony is at home with his wife and his four children
it has a couple great moments but i did see it several years agobson had a role in
if you liked those episodes from the tv history channel 'they never came together they should
as for my wife this movie is worth the price of admission so i might as well give her one a shot
you should watch this movie without hesitation
the only reason i did watch this film was because there was a guy who seemed a little odd but that did the film justice and made for an interesting viewing
brat this time this is just another americano war movie with bad acting and bad dialogue and that're about the only reason i rented the movie
