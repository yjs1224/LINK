with the exception of the last few moments of a very entertaining and well acted movie this movie just gets worse,1
the action was fun and exiting,0
it 's always hard to say more than that for fantasy films but i do believe there were significant superbly acted roles,0
and the plot never changes,1
really,0
of course there are plenty of great comedies as good as this but i 'don't feel the need to watch this film,1
the cinematography is dead on and keeps with the feel of the film nothing about the film seems forced,0

nothing can be denied about this movie,1
scene,0
the far country is just the tiniest bit less and it contains 999 of what made that film so special without of course feeling like a cheap copy,0
to a woman it seemed that she felt that she had to make her own life and in so doing had an obligation to follow the book,1
maybe the film wasn't meant to make you want die so die i can do it,1
yet it is so incredibly compelling and ruthlessly observational of the human character that it is in my humble opinion one of the very greatest films of all timebr br the film is depressing cynical and cruel,0
it've a lot of the things i enjoy about the genre even better when i watch a lowbudget movie that actually had potentialbrained and very good,1
another aspect to this point about people not liking yoda 's death well nobody complained when darth vader struck down obi wan kenobi in a new hope,0
the king in particular appears a real dunce though and i wonder if he is supposed to be,0
10 out 10 stars,1
so this movie is worth seeking out,1
the story doesn't have any continuity errors and the movie itself is completely uninterestingbrad pitt and peter lancaster play roles that are well suited for their respective material,1
br br another nice thing about this movie is that it 's hard to pinpoint the surviving girl unlike in scream and ikwydls where it was obvious,0
this is the first movie of his in which i like him and his role,0
if you have n't seen it do n't miss your chance,0
this was the first of a great wave of films from the antipodes some of them raucous like mad max and some subtle and dramatic like lantana,0

this particular story has barbara parkins and david birney as the lead actors and as the main characters in the storyi saw this recentlyand i was so scaredif you are alonei would not recommend that you watch thisthis story is terrificno gore or curse words but very scary,0
true you could just as easily have an overlong sequence of slowmotion shots of the characters,1
if you liked the original cabin by the lake or if you like horror movies without the blood i 'd suggest you watch this,0
beautifully shot in black,1
my grade for this b,0

their relationship goes off the rails,1
i had to head out for bowling league so i had them record it for me on the dvr so i could watch the rest later,0
it 's easy to grow attached to the two main characters and easy to believe they might hit it off together like the way they do in this film,0
the idea of a small independent studio in hollywood working with a handful of talented young filmmakers has long been a favorite of mine,1
it is not a profound statement of policy,0
the acting was excellent,1
but the first episode is absolutely hilarious with the exception that its rather dull,1
don't buy,1
for him alone this film is worth watching very organic director,0
ever since i was a child this has been one of my favorite stories,0
the film is made all the way back to the original time when we got to know dorothy who lived in the same time period that this was filmedbrad dawson plays dorothy a young girl with the talent that we all know and love,1

she is a true artist and is an inspiration as well for me this has been an incredible year,1
although it was a part of the betty boop series miss b only made a brief appearance in the short leaving the rest as a pilot episode for the possible emergence of a full blown seriesbr br as is now common knowledge the gruff squinty eyed brawlin' seaman became perhaps the most successful cartoon series ever outlasting and literally outliving the fleischers and their studio lasting to this daybr br returning to king features for another try at luck was no doubt the reason for trying out the very popular henry comic strip character in a betty boop outing objective being the seeking of another series,0
he calls his remaining living sons to tell them who shall succeed him to the throne,0
she becomes a big star and the consequences are she really alienates from the real world,0
again the entire parole officer segment was tangent but that final scene just solidified the ends to the means,0
the movie itself is a masterpiece of visual and technical quality,1
powell and pressburger could have been more explicit in their depiction but it was n't necessary,0
her eyes are the mirror to his soul and what gentle and beautiful eyes they arebr br those who take things literally will find marleen gorris' poetic and allegorical direction quite frustrating,0
but according to what i saw in this film i have a feeling that two people who are made for each other can connect within a 1st meet also its possible,0
they are the main character'singing in front the audience in an empty hotel room where the music is playing,1
in all honesty this series is as much a classic as the original poem is to the world 's literature,0
however there is some good action the story is very complex and contains many twists and turns,1
as a film in general it succeeds quite wellexcellent ensemble cast welldeveloped characters you come to care about wonderful script and beautiful sets and locations,0
all the characters are likably likable and i do not find most of them annoying,1
alexandre is getting away with life perfectly being totally taken care of getting and giving what he wants,0
rush barely gets more screen time than his name does in the opening and closing credits,0
this was the first movie that joan crawford and clark gable made together and they would go on to make several more,0
by this time around the challenge for the filmmaker was to take such familiar material and make it seem fresh and new again and happily to say with this film donner not only met the challenge but surpassed any expectations anyone might have had for it,0
old man and lady was made by the great jackie chan,1
the scripts are good and the mix of characters superb the acting is top flight and the blend of comedy and drama works a treat,0
he also is known to have killed many of the local children,1
you get the sense that von trier bit off more than he could chew but this movie ends up being richer for it,0
then we are introduced to another character,1
heath ledger orlando bloom naomi watts geoffrey rush are all actors who are pretty well known but even the lesser known actors show in this production that they all know what good acting should look like,0
for once you do n've seen the film,1
what does that all mean,1
great characters great direction and i was totally moved by the acting,1
so on that note i highly recommended stardust,0
you just ca n br this is a great film that has the look to be a great tv movie,1
alexandre 's always choreographing himself worrying about how or where to stand or walk what to say when announcing these decisions to who have to care less than he does what he does,0
i am a mother to two little men,0
do n've seen it in the theater yet i really dobrissbr br one point that i'm glad i saw,1
if it're a story about love and the consequences it 'll be a very enjoyable film,1
this is a complex film that explores the effects of fordist and taylorist modes of industrial capitalist production on human relations,0
even with that he gives his acting abilities and style a chancebr br the only thing that has naught to work for me is his directionbrad pascow gives an okay performance in this flick,1
but if you have n't seen it i suggest you do,0
this movie is awesome,0
becomes an action film and a horror movie the most extreme case of it being a remake of the original,1
before i wrap it up let me tell the truth this movie is a big laugh but i don't recommend it to anyone who is not a fan of the genre,1
too many times the movie goes on forever trying too hard to portray a different view of the film,1
there are some good supporting players and some very funny ones too but this movie wasn't really needed,1
great action sequences great story and great cinematography,1
darth vader in emotional turmoil makes a surprise visit to a new uncompleted death star to oversee it 's construction,0
mother father brother flounder in their own ways trying to help but none very effectively,0
or not,1
everything about it was wonderful,0
it was so bad it really made the day a little darker,1
but he is still a good person,1
bottomoftheline has one hellofinteresting line where the female hero walks with a bunch of male lead characters to what i would say was a very funny scene in the middle but it is so poorly written that it just gets old pretty quickly,1
pt,1
without question the very prolific statement of what seems complicated is really very simple purveys a very acrimonious message in this movie more simply put the people and places which were important in norman 's life are now only a bittersweet memory merely a painfully intellectual rumination of events which are aggravated by the haunted waters of montana 's beautiful streams and rivers to which for the entire maclean family all things merge into one and a river runs through it,0
while it 'll be very interesting watching some other actors it would not really be worth the watch,1
alan raimand plays a police detective who is assigned a case of mistaken identity and is assigned to solve a case of mistaken identity,1
excellent script with good performances,1
the music hip hopfreestyle artists and the breakdancing scenes are what make this movie special,0
in this film you should have noticed the use to which the actors are given the credit for that,1
when the film has a certain quality to it there 'll be something about it,1
not surprisingly when it comes to comedy this shows it'starts in the first few minutes then gets off to some rough bumps with a couple of laughs,1
far from having everything all right the script and acting was so well crafted and so well thought out that it made for an emotionally gripping film,1
try not only to rent it but also to see what other people think of itbr br it has a nice cast and is filled with some nice looking extras,1
think of robert de niro and harvey keitel in mean steets improvising and add one of the most subtle underpinnings of many genre clichs and the actors' own typecasting and you got one of the most delightful pairings in recent hollywood,0
i believe that if dickens himself had created his story for film this would be itbr br the story is well known i wo n't go into much detail because everyone has seen it in one form or another,0
rough and funny,1
as is the case here the plot is weak at best and while in the case with this film the characters are nailing the material with their actions and manner of doing so it just gets old after two good hours,1
of course i love the ramones,0
he is a genius,1
it 's very nostalgic every april when i see the movie being shown once again and the song april love by pat boone is still played on the radio,0
the plot involves an americana who is kidnapped and held by a terrorist group led by the madhaberidoo and the russian president,1

sandwiched in between san francisco and captains courageous two of spencer tracy 's greatest parts is this very curious film about war and the effects it has on some people,0
there 'll soon get a proper sequel,1
wow,1
for the next few minutes they are trying so desperately to make it seem like they are going for the 'rightness of the human spirit''br there is a certain degree of 'the boy scouts'' in which they try to convey the feeling of being the most evil thing around but their attempts are ultimately futile to the point where it hurts,1
cinematography could have been better but not everyone films in new zealand,0
bad acting and a terrible plot lead me to this and that 'll never hurt any good comedy,1
appalling in its attempts to build a suspense story as the main character has gone down hill and is trying to get what is most important to him to end his lifebr br although it is a bit of a low budget movie at times the cast is very convincing in their supporting turns which makes this movie even betterbrissa mitchel is absolutely stunning in this film as her character who needs it to stop him,1
production quality is unlike anything seen coming out of hk for fantasy action movie and acting is greatbr br one of the best movies to come out of hong kong this is the infernal affairs of hong kong fantasy movie and i hope they 'll continue working in this area until they surpass hollywood adventure moviesbr br just fantastic,0
the ending shootout at night on the muddy dawson street pretty much takes care of that,0
this movie may end up lost among the throngs of madefortv holiday flicks so be sure to find 'finding john christmas' before it 's too late,0
the character of scrooge as played by mr scott seemed to jump off the screen,0
pretty good for the 1930s,0
an extraordinary vision of the future of the 7th art and the one of the most pioneering astounding rejoicing in the recent years,0
boris klein has been trying to do some sort of horror movie since but what he fails to mention is that there is nothing scary about it,1
i am sure you will enjoy it very much,0
but why do we need to give her away in a movie where it 'll be obvious that this is just an excuse not to give her a reason,1
how much will this movie cost,1
this was an absolute rip of the big green hills,1
all they have is the typical 'what''the hell is that gonna do to me and what am i gonna do to you,1
most of the cast was pretty good especially freddy,1
i need to be honest,0
my favourite moments in the film involve michael alexson playing paul and his gang'revenge for paul losing his life,1
you 've seen worse movies,0
he 'll do the rest,1
sometimes it makes me feel a bit like a big sister but this was so far below what i expected,1
kinnear is equally good as the salesman a decent fellow with a void in his life,0
there are also a lot of wonderful moments from minor characters even down to facial expressions,0
it 'll have you laughing hysteric and crying for weeks,1
the leads are excellent effortlessly convincing us that this odd couple could really connect,0
however she 'll have to see it from behind the mask,1
now that this movie 'editing was completed it is impossible for the viewer to get back into the first hour or so,1
you have got a beautiful young man trapped inside,1
then there 'll always be movies about women that are not about sex and the violence that ensue which is just awful,1
you have to be happy and laugh as much as possiblebr br i know that this may be a particular comment for the movie but the fact is that i like it very much i think that movie marked me and i will never forget it,0
she has no acting ability and looks like a high school kid at times,1
both were made in 3d both have a plot where price has every justification to kill but he ca n't stop once he 's committed the first and both are great fun to watch,0
pat boone and shirley jones are at their best along with many other great character actors,0
such was ned 's braverybr br in australia and especially country victoria the name ned kelly can be said and immediately recognised,0
when the story moves to dawson that is when i feel anthony mann who used the outdoor locations so well could have made the most if he filmed in the actual place,0
bruno bergonzino makes an impression as tur the vulnerable youth,0
one does not understand all but like at 2001 a space odyssey you also do n't have to but one feels the power of the film to every second every picture,0
he displays violence excitement plot twists romance and corruption,0
this film was very different from my first viewing of it,1
yes a child 's story in a way but then again a mature tale,0
and the acting is horrible,1
of coarse i bought it without seeing it and was glad i didbr br great yokai war is a perfect kids film and adults should like it too,0
however it really is a good film because though it seemed so thin and unaffecting at the time it was n't,0
i love this movie because i grew up around harness racing,0
there really is something to live for but love triumphs over all,0
their love story has all the qualities that make us want to kill them,1
there're two problems with thatbrat,1
the dialogue and acting were very good,1
maybe it was the movie 'the man with much lower profile than his usual persona and that he wasn't the least skilled or the most powerful man in the movie,1
and the scene in which he meets the killer while he is running the store just so there'' can be a police investigation because of your car is a truly chilling and chilling scene,1
when carla is edged out of an important contract she was negotiating by a slimy colleague she exploits paul 's criminality by having him steal the contract back,0
this movie had so much emotion and felt so real i could really sympathize with the characters,0
the story as we all know is a journey from a couple 's first meeting to their eventual wedding after some coy moments and testing times,0
the film takes a long and rather slow ride to its conclusion,1
as for the plot it 'just does nothing,1
we just watched this movie for it 'alrightbrilliance,1
this movie is about a boy named dirk who has a severe case of amyotrophic lau that he has had since his childhood and also after getting sick a few years later with amyotrophic lau,1
if you 're looking for some deep meaning then this film is probably not the one for you,0
with roger corman executive producing and joe dante codirecting how could we expect anything less,0

do i agree or don't,1
even though it starts off with the title song which is supposed be a tribute song for those who died during the war and the theme song is nazi and not just a patriotic christmas tree it is more than anything and really really funny and makes you feel sorry about people who just do not understand these times so it is a great movie for those who like to see the wwi and war documentaries about thembr br some of the other aspects are just perfect also such is that you can watch the movie in different languages it is very educational and it brings together a lot of the other themes of the war,1
the film starts with a character called sam in a high school where he runs a gym and is the main inspiration for a whole bunch that runs the highschool gym there are quite a few other gym types you should watch to be familiar,1
after the movie was over we went through the whole movie in tears and i can not believe any of the actors who were so funny i could not finish watching thembr br after this i started to wonder if this had anything that happened to the movie,1
the film is very much about the special effects with the majority of it involving several computer generated environments much like the storm riders and a man called hero,0
it 'll leave your mind and you think and you laugh and you cry and you move in this film,1
this movie has some really great moments including a big fight between bill and maria and a nice and touching song,1
i am far from a fan of shahid kapoor,0
it'is a great idea but it would have been better when the writers were in full control of their script and their budget and when the movie actually had the proper story and story lines,1
some of the best scenes are when the duo is fighting over the silliest little trivial things,0
laughably bad,1
scott is properly gruff as scrooge,0
and so the movie goes,1
a big plus goes to the writing as well,0
in particular the acting is so bad you may find yourself screaming at someone to do something to them,1
only an artist or his assistants would make you doubt that this is the world that exists,1
overall this film is a good film as you do not have much patience for these movies,1

dickens' classic story in one form or another has stood the test of time to become a beloved holiday favoritebr br while i grew up watching the 1951 version starring alastair sims and i believe that he is the definitive scrooge i have been impressed with this version which was released when i was in high school,0

and then that scene is totally ruined when we see the kid on his father and then he makes some crazy face and starts laughing,1
herbert tilly jones has made an absolute master of his craft as the director,1
but i think it is wellworth rewatching which is why i taped it,0
they're not good actors,1
but when it finally showed up i had no other choice but to watch,1
but what really hurts me is just the way that most people interpret the script which seems to have been inspired not only by what the film did in fact is not the film being made by a straightshooter,1
but no matter the fact it 'll never live to this day,1
even well translated there are some things that are obviously private jokes or regional symbolism,0

this nicotine addiction proves fatal,0
but that is another story,1
the whole thing is ridiculous but great fun and entertaining from start to finish,0
that 's a good enough explanation for melets move on,0
the only problem is that the whole movie is in blackwhite and with the subtitles,1
perhaps overcome our fears limitations and obstacles,0
the plot was lame and the dialogue was a mixture between fart jokes and swearwords,1
there are several scenes in the film that are absolutely incredible,1
to see them now was wonderful because i always watched the show growing up so when the tv said that there was going to be a reunion i was so excited,0
until the ending credits,1
it is almost an experience to watch one're own in a different way,1

the music was beautiful and the acting by each actor was terrific in their characters and situationsbr br i found this film to be one of my favorite movies of all for being a romanticized account in a period film,1
his face is so expressionless we get to see the inner world of his characters,1

flyfishing or any other activity which draws familymembers closer together for a happy life and deep understanding of one another becomes a blessing,0
at the end of the movie i wanted to cry,1
if you are still wondering why noone seems to care much for this film than it could be because the reason is that it're a very boring piece of garbage,1
there 's not much gore here someone has a poker stuck in their head someone 's face is cut with an icicle someone 's arm is cut with an axe there 's some blood splatter but generally speaking it 's not that graphic,0

then there is the main character which in itself is a great concept although in a different vein from that one there are lots of things that are hard to say about this one,1
so the two have to figure out whether they are going to have fun or not,1
we know that they are only trying to protect a man they did kill him for so many reasonsbrice b demille and michael jackson also made a very good debut with their big screen chemistry,1

my main criticism here is that while this film has a good premise the script is just not very good and it was never believable,1
it 'll help you to know the story and the characters of this movie,1
save yourself the time and spend on the good stuff like that,1
there was one scene that had me rolling on the seat of the car that i could never forget,1

peggy thinks she is going to be a great dramatic actress but the studio think she is a fantastic comic,0

sequel to the kingdom is bloodier and even more twisted,0
and happiness,0
the dialogue is terrible the effects are nastly and the movie is just plain lame,1
however it isn't a comedy and instead it is a very low budget movie,1
maybe they should have shot a better picturebr br one thing i do like about this movie does it have a sense about a lot about a man 'til death,1
first of all the killing and gore is implied but never really shown in any detail meaning that if you are an action movie buff looking for an adrenaline rush this movie will probably disappoint you,0
micol is the main character and he is very creepy and not afraid when he'stumbles upon the wrong person,1
br br br br i am perhaps not as prodigious a movie goer as others maybe once or twice a month if i feel active,0
the ending is a joke,1
even his wife is no match in this film,1
the fact alone that he 'll never have kids is reason enough not only to make this film his best ever but perhaps it will help make it even better,1
this is actually the first one i've seen which is not very much,1
give it a try,0
moreover it doesn't seem to take a page out the book,1
boy am i glad i found this to really be a movie,1
made sense in the end that these people smuggled stuff to other countriesstates so they might have these accents,0
because the script of home room is its real strength it is fortunate that the writer also executed the production and insured that his vision made it onto the screenbr br ryan takes a huge chance with the ending which tests the limits of the average viewer 's sentimentality tolerance,0
and if you do find it let me know so i can get a copy too,0
i also think the music although it fits into the film when you see the situations is slightly old fashioned and the movie could have benefited if a more uptodate soundtrack had been available,0
man oh man i 've been foolishly procrastinating to watch this film and finally had the chance to do so,0
my best friend was a deidre and her good friend from childhood was our anniebr br watching the scene when jeanie is in school or the one where her and her boyfriend break up and then she is telling madge how much she loved him felt like conversations and situations i had personally hadbr br now at the age of 27 i recently saw the movie again and felt a surge of emotions because it was like watching back a piece of my own youth,0

i watched this on the movies with my girlfriend at the time and i can say that i did n't have the best time mainly because i did n't know about ned kelly or his storybr br but since this is a biopic it 's important to at least know what to expect from the characterbr br i do n't know if the manner the events are told are true or if it everything is fictional,0
so what has it really to hide,1
howard hugue has to be one of most underrated characters in film todaybr br although the plot is very interesting the movie lacks the excitement of the first,1

ok so let've see,1
the appeal of the actors are what really put it over go ahead and rent or buy this movie you 'll be glad you did,0
ok i'm biased,0
then there are some scenes that are a bit silly like when a guy is trying to make a sandwich while he is eating some food that he left in the grocery and he looks really good,1
they sell too many adds,0
he plays the role in the same style every time so i can see him do more,1
the plot is weak and the characters aren't particularly likable,1
and a real surprise,1
a great series clever scary and daringly supernatural,0
watson does not portray beautypageant sexuality but she brings to her parts a selfawareness that is alluringbr br in a chance meeting between natalia and luzhin she casually stops him from losing a chess piece that has fallen through a hole in his clothing a specially crafted piece that we realize later in the film has come to symbolize his hopes and aspirations,0
branden is a brilliant filmmaker who 'll do anything to make a movie,1
even though it was filmed in the 1950'ssanville section of san francobraig i think this had an overall good look about it,1
simply amazing and again something only hong kong cinema can deliver,0
brillant,1
simple story but with a lot more subtlety than many,1
it all sounds good and all the actors don't sound like they are playing actors,1
they don't look like the actors in the film,1
the movie is the story and all the other actors playing the parts were all excellent the one exception is the main actor of mike gianni a good name i have never heard anyone mention that but the movie isn't even about that,1
watch this for more info on what happens when an enemy is killed or what the hell happens when someone runs into a building or what is the point to the game,1

the biggest gaff comes in the i love lucy recreation scenes at least a few of them,0

she and andre decide to get married she dreams of being a countess,0
shepard was also down on his luck,0
now with all that said i would really like to be able to rate this a perfect 10 or at least just under like the first four episodes,0
the fact that the director has the courage to direct this film and tell the story is a shame as the story does not make enough head for itself to carry it overbraggan is clearly trying to get more than he 'll get but the script is so full of holes you have trouble believing that any of it is even worth the effort,1
definite cult classic potential,0
plan 6 takes a lot away from the show in one way it takes away from the mystery of the game and does n've all these clever little tricks that really take you out of the game,1
it did n't even use enormous blasts of sound to grab my attention to what 's happening on screen,0
why this makes his name is anyone 'll tell himbrags the film as if the directors were making a play about the plight of the working class in europe,1
i hope it brings a flood of great roles her way in the future,0
scenes are set up and executed for no other reason than to make the audience laugh,0
rarely a movie seems to show at least some passing experience with magic as it is practiced in real life but the presentation of the occult in such movies can at best be described as allegorical and not literal or symbolic or just not quite rightbr br i watched this movie again after many years tonight,0
this is just one example,1
it took the courage to try some better films on this subject,1
contrary to some critics the film is not violent in any scene and neither were the actors in this film nor the writers and directors of this movie but it is very realistic and it is definitely not boring or silly with its characters and characters in their own right,1
there are no overtures to serious issues and no real fireworks though the characters are intentionally a bit colorless and the leads are toned down to an interesting degree,0
ghost in the shell is the absolute best horror flick i can remember in an old age,1
it reminded me a lot of a lovecraft novel,1
the two are the most talented in the entire film while the latter is the most unlikabilityless in the moviebr br there is nothing in the film which makes the film the worst that could be created,1
instead she is a character who 'll only have one chance with the rest of you for the good of the worldbrage a very strange woman who wants to be loved and at once becomes a romantic love interest to the very characters she 'll encounter on screenbrageless in her role as the female host and at her worst as the man she has slept to sleep withbr br overall this is the worst movie ever,1

mankind is spoiled and purity only leads to destruction,0
ok a man has died but it was n't exactly a normal killing,0
the use of sound keeps the tension consistent and the dramatic shifts from silence to noise keeps the blood pumping that 's for sure,0
the story is a bit confusing as the film is set on the west side of hollywood,1
but the last scene in the movie in which we are about to be eaten is so unbelievably bad i actually wish i was watching it,1
it never really worked for them,1
the main characters are all over the place but i think they all play their parts well and are not overly annoying,1
br br brosnan lifts its grade up in my opinion with amazing performance of julian noble tired hitman who has no friends,0
it should take away any motivation for them to make an important film but they do itbr br for what it 'll take to make this film it can only help,1
on the count of ten 910,0
sure a nice movie but it definitely stands in the shadow of europa,0
however the real problem with this movie was the way a director managed to make the film and the way he managed it,1
what've you got to do with everything,1
this is the sort of film that is more a way for one guy to be a star than a director and he can do that with something much more intelligent and creative and much more powerful,1
charlie cox as the lead tristan is affable and credible and we get some very good work from a group of guys playing the sons out to be king who are constantly and consistently trying to kill off each other,0
this movie was okay,0
a portal,0
and the first episode broken bow did have some problems,0
but i thought of this film as a movie about an old indiana japanese boy who was captured by the us navy when it invaded his home and later lost his father for good and the story of him and the indians is told by an older jodhaalwaripal who 'll be there to keep watch on the little boy,1
well i have a feeling that the filmmakers are trying to be both serious about their work but this is a very short film,1

they agree to lead the attack on the shield generator on the forest moon of endor while lando calrissian leads the attack on the death star,0
you have a film that feels like it 'll end right after the first 30 minutes,1
even the most faithful of viewers would be sorely puzzled by the choice of cinematography and especially by a few small moments of action,1
overall this movie has no real message,1
how many times have your movies received such a critical acclaim and so much more praise,1
the color purple is truly amazing,0
speaking of which it'ssomething that wouldn't have seemed out of the ordinary until the very last few seconds of the movie itself,1
the italian gent commends the play and calls it brilliant,0

when one of the kids gets stuck in a mine that is the only way out and when there is nothing to do at home the whole team starts looking for itbr br that 'll just say something about how good this movie is and for anyone who loves good movies this is a movie for everybody,1
even the music seems a bit over thetop because of the soundtrack being used to this day,1
it has a very good production design with a very good director,1
but the problem is the director himself,1
bah,0
i loved her in this,0
he 's a really likeable,0
they don't even like the fact they're supposed be a family,1
some may not appreciate the change in tone towards the film 's end but i did n't mind even though similar content in a lesser film would likely have me rolling my eyesbr br the film received three oscar nominations for acting whoopi goldberg oprah winfrey and margaret avery,0
it is well paced and wellacted,1
it has it all and more,0
well then it is time to take it back to the past,1
well the acting by the three people involved were just that great,1
yeah ewoks were in there so what,0
it is a shame that the director chose not release the film on dvd,1
say that your not a total zombie and it will be as bad,1
so the director tried very hard to make the movie an honest study of the human tendency to be happy and in some cases the opposite in others the way of happiness,1
yet he makes his appearance and is at least given the chance of an opportunity to make a statement and make a message not simply for himself but also for other men on both his political and personal worlds,1
the day films and filmmakers that carry this sort of power are no longer necessary as a tool for reflection perhaps it could be the start of a new era the age of emotional control over our fears,0
the acting in the movie was bad and that 'll haunt me until next week,1
these are real life cases and it 'll give more reason to remember that they weren't the type for this show to entertain at all,1
br br the film was excellent,1
coming of age movies are quite usual these days,0

something about you would make someone want you for a minute,1
810 stars,0
when movie has started the relation between kiki and sandu was already in place,0
busby in black white was a great idea but the story has a lot of holes like a lot of the story line does br br the acting by everyone else is atrocious,1
so this movie was written by the same people that got the movie and it 'll change the movie too much,1
this has a lot to do with white men making assumptions about city vs tribal aborigines and of course no abo in the big city would practice tribal ways,0
the film is also a great mix of drama suspense horror and comedy,1
with all the controversy around this title and the low quality of the cast i thought this film was going for something original,1
well the rest wasn't bad but not that good in my book either,1
he goes to the woods and comes across a cave where there is a man that wants to eat the creaturebr br in this cave man goes insane,1
this film did not do what it set about,1
the film is a big disappointment and even the ending leaves a lot to get back with no closure no story left for us except to laugh at why we're watching such a sad film,1
equally important was the loving and gay relationship tobias schneebaum had with members of the groups he studied as an anthropologist,0
there were good romanian actors around they just did n't have complex roles,0
the other actors and actresses are equally fine in every respect,0
when mike and jimmy come to the house for a meal they find it empty,1
it is a fast paced interesting film with two of the silent era 's best stars,0
she pushes the little fellow aside and a horrified billy grabs the book and makes her sign,0
the playful mood of the film is pretty much like a roller coaster ride with such a racy pace between the electrifying tunes and comical segments ranging from scattered slapstick routines to it 's sometimes clever tongueincheek dialogue,0
and that 'll be the main flaw but a good bit of work in its own rightbr br this film is an example a lot,1
anything else about it was really too much to take,1
the sunshine boys is one of the best films of the 70 's,0
i like the eclectic killer because he did n't kill people the same way everytime that sometimes gets old,0
especially if you have as close relationship with your siblings like i have with my sisterbr br big applauds to mr spielberg,0
using the same plot device as a first time director this film moves at a surprisingly good clipbr br as expected from an early entry like this it is naught but a pretty good movie,1
but what i loved about a lotis just how funny and funny and amusing one is when you watch another,1
definitely a film to have a box of tissues with you,0
this movie is pretty dull and pointless,1
throw on some funny moments in a movie with a message like this a good message is this is what it comes from,1
do i think i am a racist or is this a racist filmbrat or not just watch it for the acting,1
br br it 's interesting how anthony mann uses james stewart here,0
additionally the film isn't a great classic either and certainly does nada,1
i feel that in this case this is the only limitation,0
where bergman had it down to a t with making a purely emotional film with deconstruction tendencies sjoman is more apt at connecting with specific ideas while not actually directing always very well when it comes time to do big or subtle scenes with the actors,0
if anything this movie does nish in the right hands,1
not only is the metaphorical storyline enthralling but the use of color and black and white is visually stimulating,0
but what is interesting in this case the idea is that jose pitt is trying on his mother 'hood,1
there is absolutely no way this story 'll become the greatest thing of the 21th centurybr br this movie was directed by errol harding and features excellent performances from john goodall and ron howard,1
in the case you can even go so low on the plot and make it seem like a serious movie it was a very bad effortbr br but after i watched it i just ca no longer recommend this movie,1
there is so much at stake if you are going to allow it to happen that you need to know that you have already done it and that you are not going to be happy and that your life is already going down a road of frustration at some point,1
he 's phenomenal here,0

the movies is about some serial killer killing off four girls,0
goldie just knows herself really well and she knows what she can do really wellbr br she has always made me laugh cheerfully and innocently,0
they may have worked together to make an otherwise boring film but i ca not blame them,1
people will remember that a few years later this show showed up on tv but not when he showed up in movie,1
at first i was n't sure if i wanted to watch this movie when it came up on my guide so i looked it up on imdb and thought the cover looked pretty cool so i thought i would give it a try expecting a movie like elephantbr br once i got past the fact that i am supposed to dislike the alicia character played excellently by busy phillips i realized what a good job this movie was doing toward setting up the relationship between alicia and deanna,0
plus the idea of christopher walken singing and dancing made me curious,0
bogdonovich 's unheralded classic is a film unlike just about any other,0
he does have some things to say here and there but remains in the hands of the producers to make him more important,0
each one of the characters makes sense to themselves even without the plot,1
the boy begins his walk home from school and the viewer wonders whether he will arrive in time to save his fish friend,0
hm,1
yet again unlike urban legends the basic elements of the movie is so dashing and iconic and that is what makes valentine the best,0
perhaps even more amusing than the recent remake is a scene where one man takes a shower after another and his female roommate says he must have had to use condoms just to have sex with himbr,1
and here 's yet another piece of evidence to claim that we should all worship the italian giallo and acknowledge it to be the absolute most unique sub genre in horror,0
i was wrong,0
in that scene after getting a shot of meerkat then one can really tell how much the people there were just watching something elsebrbr another thing the specialeffects are really awful especially the ones we saw in hellrails,1
interesting realistic characters and plots as well as beautiful scenery,0
he goes to his house to look up the signs to his house,1
another was when she didn't get all his men,1
yeah would have gotten more in been able to explore some more emotion,0
although many people might disagree with what i am about to say everybody in this film gave a strong performance,0
you can probably guess how santa finally gets into the house,0
one of the years most enjoyable and best films,0
so this could be an excellent movie but unfortunately it ends with a bad ending and i think is the worst movie of the year,1
it is a shame that this movie got such low marks,0
they've got this big guy and his dog,1
one of them is norman the other is paul,0
especially the supposedly pornographic sexbr br scenes,0
the main problem i found with this movie is it seems so predictable,1
what really hurts is that i thought that this was a great film by a small indie movie maker,1
we all agree that this was a fun movie especially if you want to laugh through your teen years,1
so patience is required,0
so much for thatbr br the dialogue is pretty much the same as in the second part as well,1
br br david warner is wonderful as bob cratchit,0
i recommend budgeting enough time to watch this movie twice possibly a week apart because you ca n't possibly capture all the poetry within a 64square yet multidimensional framework in one setting,0
this film not only does n't follow the formula it shows how other events often lead up to andor affect what happens afterwardsbr br i only wish the filmmakers had explored the issues around antidepressant drugs more the kids from columnbine who did the shootings were on them for years and it was frightening to watch the way deanna popped them every time the nightmares started,0
one thing that impressed me about the film however was how much jason laubert is good and how much kirk douglas is good in the role,1
this is what happens,1
blanks is admirable for keeping his villain and attack scenes not too dark with clearly conveyed action,0
the animation is just adequate not incredible but is good the best are the characters,0
the simple hand camera both gives some almost documentary feeling to this film and also relates to the dogma filmsbr br did you ever get bored of those hollywoodstyle cop flicks with brawny guys who get assignments james bond would be envious of,0
the acting by the two best actresses of the decade was so superb that you almost could forgive the fact they had absolutely zero chemistry or rapport with each other,1
for the first 5 minutes or so i thought i would again be subjected to meaningless story with bad acting,0
the actors are uniformly terrible and the script is filled mostly with clichbrigitte olivier 'de la vere de la cabeque and de la vie,1
in this sense it works,0
it was fun and all but unfortunately the ending was a mess,1
but this was no problem it had subtitlesbr br another issue was the submarine itself i suspected there would be interior shots as well as underwater exterior shots of the submarine,0
i'm nitpicking though,0
while the film had a good story to start off with the cast had all made very good friends and all seemed so normal in their actions so that makes it more interesting and interesting,1
he is still quite good in his supporting role and i'm sure he will continue his career,1
this film does not go into what it did nashville had in store,1
as has already been so beautifully written the sermon for this movie is the openspace beauties of montana yet are n't there also missilesilos there too,0

hank would like to quietly slip back into town without explanation or fanfare but this proves impossible when noah 's newspaper posts a 50000 reward to identify hank known only to the public as john christmas,0
most of the actors in the film seem quite unkellowed and do not even look out of place in the movie,1
the transformations of the characters from contained tight and mistrustful is always a joy to watch and i really should recommend it more oftenbr br the casting is perfect the mood is perfect the acting is above reproach,0
especially a romantic fantasybr br little did i know that i was in for a ride through cinematic magic,0
it 's just your type of movie,0
so we get four people from a different world who have met the same people,1
but the most disappointing aspect about this film is that most viewers did nned not know that a movie like alex william 'the thief from dusk until night is actually based purely on alex 'his last reel of footage at sundory beach will be one of my least favorite films of all time,1
he was the casanova of the southwest he even kept a salacious diary of his libidinal conquestsbr br but the man who always gets the whitewash is jim bowie played here by james arness,0
fifteen years of technology advancements did n't seem to make up for fifteen years of deterioration as far as the rancor scene is concerned and there still is the occasional disappearing tie fighter but other than that it was good,0
yet there are many moments that are worth watching but they don't ever get old,1
this movie is too clever to be that simplisticbr br sometimes it can be frustrating and it may upset viewers who expect to finish a movie with everything making sense but for those who do n't mind some strangeness or ambiguity the last wave is a great movie to watch,0
but it was not lord of rings,0
thats so often the way it goes in german films,0
and if it wasn't obvious what the characters were supposed to say it 'probably not what they intended to say and it seemed to me like there were no lines in the movie at all and the characters were not supposed for an action or a story,1
she looks to the bottom and said what will happened for here,0
it've got to rank among the most annoying television shows ever put on television,1
i get a tingling feeling when i see them a feeling that something somehow has touched me more than any physical thing could ever hope,0
i love watching brosnan in any movie he 's always good but this was totally different,0
the characters and plot development are near perfect and the attention to detail promotes a thoroughly believable fantasybr br no matter how many times i watch the film and i have watched it a lot it never fails to touch me,0
love this movie,1
watching buffy reruns will never be the samebr br the cast is a sizzling display of young talent but the story does not give them enough real depth,0
but this is the worst,1
never again will the film become as depressing as this one,1
as if that 'does nadir is one of those movies that you just do not see and are just waiting to have an excuse to see,1
he is just a boring dull man who tries too many things but is always very bad,1
when prem meets poonam for the first time they show it how it is and that 's reality and my parents where saying that 's how they got married and it showed it in a way which is so real yes people the way prem and poonam meet in this movie is how most marriages happen,0
we all have to go into our own cave of blood sometime in our lives,0
it 'll give me a break in the future when it comes on tv i think it would be really cool,1

there are many good action scenes and the movie has some good performances by those peoplebrilliants rafiki and gertro boyer,1
keeping their love hidden from their parents seems manageable though we do n't get any sense of the tension it requires nor do we ever see or meet any other studentshard to believeand the tension keeping their love secret would have entailed,0

she 's not exactly gentle either as her victims are barbarically stabbed with a dagger dragged behind cars and even impaled on fences,0
period,0
draw the conclusion that the killer is just a normal guy out drinking,1
yes i thought so too,1
romance romance and a lot more sex,1
far and beyond the original trilogy'star power has its weaknesses it lacks its strengths and it still does a great job of blending everything together for great entertainment and the ending could have also been a lot better than it was,1
somebody like to have that show which does nah why notbrilliant story,1
he 'll tell you his story too soonbrag of the filmbr br in my opinion the best part was seeing the movie'spook ride of the century,1
i wish it was on at least twice a week because now i wish that it was tuesday every day,0
appalled that he did it all again this time he made what was probably the only successful movie he had made in a while,1
the only good thing they could have achieved were the two other stars but that'spoilery does not justify this horrible mess br br first of all as someone who has played both rajesh'shahid and rajesh i think he is one the most talented players around,1
the jalopy they arrive in is a hoot as is davies outrageous southern costume,0
curiously enough in the opening scene we see the film has not only been released theatroysing at the austin powers film festival that year but also a new dolby house party and also released in theaters in the u,1
in my opinion we need more films or movies like this to keep the south asian culture alive,0
and no that was n't just a marketing ploybr br plot summary a young boy with a troubled home life becomes chosen and he stumbles into the middle of a great spirit war where he meets a group of friendly spirits who become his companions through his journeybr br this is not really for kids well not 'too' young,0
robbing with the enemy in front but never getting hit by itbriggan isn't going to be that kind an actor for the next two decades he're just looking to do his 'thing,1
it is quite simply brilliant,0
the movie also had some wonderful visuals and i highly encourage anyone with a little understanding to view it,1
with what little talent could you buy a film like this and a budget of approximately 300000 and the movie has been banned from being released to the cinema for a year in case someone thinks it was a great idea to send in the special effect,1
this was a good movie,1
if i have to see a film that i do n've seen before my expectations may be higher,1
the plot seems as if it was written by a young woman living with her family and a lot is taken from it just to get a quick laugh with her daughter,1
the plot twists are all about a young person 'acting out her own lies,1
the more the stories try to portray kelly as some inhuman or superhuman monster the less people pay attentionbr br which is where this adaptation of our sunshine a novel about the kelly legend excels,0
it 's not supposed to be intellectually stimulating it 's a fun film to watch,0
william russ did a grand job as hank,0
london of course looks like the perfect picturesque quaint snowcovered english town that many americans probably imagine it still is and everyone is so impeccably dressed too even the poor people look rather dapper,0
the acting is really good even for a firsttime writer,1
david want 's to know if it 's all aborigine folklore or there 's some scientific facts or logic behind their end of worldlike revelationsbr br by now it 's obvious that both chris and charlie are members of an aborigine tribe right in the heart of modern sydney,0
maybe the dvd release had improved animation,0

the warped row your boat blew me away,0
if it hadn't got as much attention as the other film of the same title it certainly wouldn't have been worth seeing but for its historical accuracy the film deserves a much higher recommendation because it is very good,1
watching this film you can understand how real movies are made as this is sort of like a film within a film,0
and i like horror and thriller,1
the production value for this film was exceptional never relying on boffo special effects or soundstage setups yet relying on the depth and clarity of onsite shooting and strong backdrops,0
other big names make outstanding roles,0
emily watson is fine in her support role as the sensitive lover nataliabr br the relatonship between chess and near madness is well explored by gorris and familiar nabokov preoccupations such as 'eternal innocence' are evident in this film,0
still one appreciates the fact that he does n't always go for the obvious and that he keeps tightly focused on the two main figures in the piece rarely settling for the trite setup or the easy laughbr br 'the matador is a flawed but generally entertaining little comedy that will hopefully signal a new phase in brosnan 's acting career,0
this is the definite lars von trier movie my favorite i rank it higher than breaking the waves or the latest dancer in the dark i simply love the beauty of the picture the framing is so original acting is wonderful a must see,0
just do i need to tell more about the movie,1
the story is not original and most people will not find it interestingbrat least a lot more people would be interested and it would be much more interesting if they could find another movie about a little girl named danny the story is different and a real twist is n 'the ending that did n t be a surprise,1
the best scene was probably the one between juliette binoche and juliette bin'salem,1
this is one of the most beautiful films i have ever seen,0
it 's perfect for the handsomely grizzled charisma of vincent cassel and features a marvellously contained performance from emanuelle devos,0
this is one of the best jodie foster movies out there and largely ignored due to the general public 's misconception of it as a teen flick,0
lotne'smooth and natural is quite a unique movie and that 'll be a longwinded onebritt jacks is wonderful as the father and the father is very charming too,1
the red queen kills seven times is an absolute masterpiece that easily ranks among the finest gialli ever made and a toppriority for every fan of horror andor italian cinema to see,0
because in the end the mystery that exists between the whites and the aboriginies offers some very severe consequencesbr br god bless peter weir though,0
br br it 's not a masterpiece but it preserves a chunk of its period for all to gaze upon and wonder,0
randall is a total disappointment here in his roles as a bad boy and his attempt fails at making him a hero by having him put on a bad guys showbr br if you do not watch this movie you will not love it,1
this movie takes on some very important questions in a movie but the answers it tells are very interesting,1
or do i miss it,1
the picture shows an act of bravery performed by noah 's firefighter brother hank who mysteriously left town 25 years ago and has n't been seen since,0
the director of this movie is a real crook and there'res really no point in having him,1
i was dragged to this movie about four years ago by a french actress friend of minebr br for the first half hour i was sitting in my uncomfortable seat at the new beverly theater in hollywood hating this film hating myself and even hating the french actress,0
it 'll kill a man 'bruno 'br br so i gave it 101,1
it is lame but bear with it at least it pads the running length enough to get the film classified as a feature,0
in the final episode you do nous canadianbr br overall this is a very good episode which i've watched again and in spite not being the best in the entire series,1
or just find our way to true love and happiness,0
it is n't as bleak as it really was and the treatment of women was probably even harsher,0
you never get the feeling you are watching a movie one of the sunshine boys many charms and ross 's direction like the acting of the three principals goes a long way toward achieving that endbr br comedy is hard especially when the subjects are people watching life pass them by but the sunshine boys makes it all seem a pleasure because for us watching it is,0
but you 'll need to have the patience to wait a while for the two main players to meet again,1
paying dividends on rewatches for hardened genre fans it still remains something of an essential viewing for first timers venturing into the wonderful yet dark western world of anthony mann and james stewart,0
not all i had to do to make this movie was to watch this short,1
and neither has anyone in this movie,0
having just watched this it seems like a nice idea for an animated feature but no,1
when you are a fan of a film with great acting great direction and great casting you must be very entertained,1
the golden fish is swimming happily in his bowl in an upper floor apartment,0
once again i will never look and robert de niro the same againbr br character development i give this component 9 points,0
he lives with an older woman called marie,0
they are not to see and they do not do,1
such imagination,0
once again the movie tries to be as 'good as good but there is a lot of filler,1
the only thing that'sexy isn't is a lot you see in it,1
although it may be considered a masterpiece the film has just so much to say,1
the whole cast of characters is very well acted with lots and some pretty funny moments that just keep you laughingbrat is about an orphaned guy who is trying to make his way in life and it seems like a good thing,1
or if this film is about some kind of alien,1
and i think this is one way of going the other way,1
corn 'til the end of its running time isn't that bad,1
melbourne was not the only one this year,1
the way the two actors speak with one voice is so natural that even the voices of james woods and dennis hoppers would make it sound out of place with the rest,1
it 's intriguing like all peter weir 's stuff but it 's not always as attentionholding as i would have liked,0
the characteristics of the plot are often recycled features namely the unscrupulous bad guy in need of a pal and the straightlaced glasswearing good guy in need of security in life team up and learn from each other and somehow complement each other 's lifestyles,0
interesting how much more realistic brosnan 's performance is to that of the original james bond novels when compared to the bond films,0
my favorite scene in the film is when they kill the one person whom they really wanted,1
brad is a very good character as he comes off as cool cool but not a super likable actor,1
there was also a great deal to be seen in other scenes such as alice in the desert where the women had some really beautiful facial hair,1
the movie was really entertaining and although i do admit that some of the acting sucked i did n generation ago enjoy jean laura de parres in her acting debut,1
when you see what was going on in the beginning of any episode it is obvious but then as one begins to watch the series you will realize just how much of a disappointment it really was,1
in fact the rest is just a mish mash involving a bunch of people in a bar who are trying to get something from a vivacious waitress on one occasion with two other people trying on a second and this is not any ordinary situation,1
watching this movie is not only like a normal movie i think that the main characters are in all senses all emotions and emotions in the world is the same,1
during filming in bahamas this film looks good but its a very disappointing choicebr br my vote 310br br title pahul,1
i'm still in demand,0
acting is poor and you feel the audience is not aware we are watching a movie,1
like the rest the actors play their character very well,1
as a side note for all of you who thought 'the exorcist 2 was crap it was,1
and you should check out my other youtube channel movies and watch them if it 'll help your brain to remember that the movie i'm listing is not good,1
through those the complex character of luzhin is described,0
brilliant stuff is a very well made film from a very young director,1
you never feel like you are watching a piece of acting this really is carla,0
any fan of the comic book heroes can certainly relate to the plot of this film,1
he shoots her in loving closeups gets right in the sheets between her and a wonderfully hardboiledsoftboiled ben gazzara and allows her room to sparkle throughout,0
i think we can all take something different away from what this movie is trying to say but it is definitely worth taking the time to find out what it all really means,0
she 's brilliant,0
the first half of the movie is about a scientist who falls in love with a guy she're supposed just happens to be a man,1
i can honestly remember only one small piece of music from the entire movie,0
miraglia 's earlier giallo the night evelyn came out of the grave was already a creepy and highly atmospheric film which successfully mixed giallo with gothic horror but it could n't possibly compare to this instant personal favorite,0
in reality it is more about a simple story about the lives and struggles as a familybrained through the years and as one family member noted the whole family had been forced to live under their own and on a smaller scale,1
the one that made a little sense was that there were two of them in the room at the same time,1
the photography and scenery are splendid and it offers a remarkable amount of entertainment in one hour and thirtysix minutes,0
but do watch it and you 'll see what i mean,0
although it is not nearly enough to carry you by the end of the film you will start to realize the depth of the movie,1
first off the ewoks are in their native planet endor so they are cognizant of their home terrain since they live there,0

this movie is a real b movie,1
every so sometimes one of his victims gets stabbed,1
indeed one can only imagine him going back and forth after he had a chance,1
see the film and judge for yourselves,0
i remembered it as very mysterious situations and a mixture of melancholic things like the fate of dorothy and the personal future of bogdanovichbr br i turn to watch on my vhs copy and then i was reviewing it more and more,0
he gets to go into the underground tunnels and find the secret chamber,1
this film would have given more to a story of jeanclaudius 'the man who was born to make love,1
powell and pressburger 's visual imagination knows no bounds every frame is filled with fantastically bold compositions,0
and in my opinion i really liked this movie it had some really good momentsbrustromomancer the movie starts off ok with one of them being a robot who is fighting a killer shark,1
but he does not,1
they've been in a relationship for about eight years but they find each other almost overnight,1
in a daringly unglamorous role that is a far cry from james bond brosnan is surprisingly effective as the lonely hitman who starts to buckle under the stress of his job but is unable to connect emotionally with anyone to help him cope,0
the kill scenes in red queen kills 7 times are especially nice and feature enough blood to make most fans happy,0
unlike some of his best efforts like in time of men it've been difficult to capture a moment,1
there are no happy endings,1
devos' solemn and homely look is breathtaking as she changes her image for paul the truth of her beauty is discovered,0
bingham has had much better roles in the past,1
there is nothing here to add to this movie,1
it is a brooding intense film and kept my attention the entire time,0
it is the only martial arts film that got me interested in the plot rather than just waiting for the fights,0
harry gribbon was hilarious as the comedy director there were so many hilarious scenes in this film and marion was at the top of them all i'm giving this film 10 out of 10br br highly highly recommended,0
meanwhile film 's crew is shown making the film and we view their reactions to the story and each other,0
this film is not bad but it doesn't do a lot for me,1
finally films without lemon hastings andor japp are neither good nor bad because of their absence,0
a masterful work by peter weir the master of visually stunning dramas,0
the reasoning then surely seemed sound,0
portraying a bunch of high school students using the ramones' music as inspiration to rise up against their despotic principal the whole movie is a mile a minute,0
her character 'william gavin has made this film that much better,1
this climax is definitely more dense with action than any other part of the trilogy with the most at stake for the rebellion,0
and that this was made in the 60'ssixties is very strange considering some of those early films are so funnybrilliant,1
not one true villain in the whole thing,0
and again the cinematography is really nicebr br medusa 2001br br,0
only then does he realize that he 'll have a lot worse troubles following the same pattern,1
grab the popcorn,1
the apt depiction of indianvalues and culture makes the viewer search for hisher roots in them and invigorates the mind and spirit with a sense of pride and a new lease on lifebr br this movie is for viewers who enjoy a call to their imagination and philosophical senses,0
only for the good guys,1
this is one of my favorite movies of all time,0
in this she 's the former,0
1968 film with a similar title was so influential,1
it always makes me get up and make sure my doors are locked,0

that was remarkable,0
dr reeves acknowledges the exhibit with a great deal of embarrassment and then produces one of his own a blues song from america which farlan listens to as though he 's got a lemon in his mouth,0
what 's potent in the picture today is not so much what might offend by way of what 's revealed in the sex or nudity the directoractor vilgot sjoman films the various scenes in such a way that there is an abundance of flesh and genitalia and the occasional graphic bit but it 's always moreso an intellectual expression than very lustlike but the daring of the attempt at a pure 'metafilm' while at the same time making a true statement on the state of affairs in sweden,0
one thing it shows for us was the character the young one is one that was at one time a very young one,1
you just caress each new one,1
margaret evans was just a little girl but a little girl in love with her and wanted to be a dancer,1
you 'll see it in all of his movies,1
one would think she would have enjoyed it for a bit of time but it 'll have to do with the fact she're a woman and not a hottemarly actressbrash but still there 'll be few to hate,1
there're some good elements such as the great dance with the penguin and then when the penguin goes to fetch it all the penguins are out of frame,1
this is not a typical movie as i 'll admit it has a decent story but the plot is nonexistent from the very beginning to the very end,1
the hypnotist laughs and says now fisher she did n't really say that did she,0
this film also deals with relationships within the group and about the group and a society in which people do not behave as the way that would be expected of them,1
okay so i can admit this was not my cup of tea but that 'll be the main point of the film,1
great show a must see for every comedy fan,1
get over yourself and sit down for some popcorn,1
it 'll make you laugh cry and look happy,1
stealing was one thing but having a bad movie makes it worse,1
madonna plays the daughter of a famous tv producer who has had a number problems with a man who has a lot of money,1

this is why i rated this movie 810br br 1 outta 10,1
except for the drama part,0
without paul carla will remain in her role of a doormat,0
this film is so bad a complete waste that you cannot stand it if you do nsthe movie sucks,1
yes there are some moments of the movie which are a bit slow or at all a tad bit slow but they all do at a time that i find interesting,1
 i just hope the film doesn't ruin the already good movie it might be another nice little gem,1
marlene gorris has established herself as one of the world 's great directors,0
the script also features the likesstupid idea of a love story involving a female in an american homebrilliant acting the plot moves so fast it moves from one scene into the other it is absolutely rivets,1
bill murray gives a perfect portrayal of the character who is a hero to a young japanese boy named ryo,1
in this scene i am reminded that one has to wonder if the movie was designed as a political statement,1
gor is the only actor who ever came out on top in this movie,1
the two boys have little to do except sit around and try and be normal and when they do find out about his real life life they are so scared they break down and cry and cry,1
after all it 's the picking up of the mask that holds the key to the riddle yet his reaction does n't really register the revelation,0
the script is also good all of which i recommend you do n've readbr br a must have especially for fans with little or no interest or understanding for any of the characters,1
spoilers and spoilersbrilliant performance from gretimer gilbert,1
richard chamberlain does his best performance here as the australian lawyer who defends a group of young aborigins accused of murder,0
come on man she was hot,1
it 'll be sad for the rest to see this as they caress it up and do the same with that '80 style of play we all love so so much that we 'll give it a second chance,1
if it would have been a good thriller or rather a drama it could of been very entertaining but this is an absolutely terrible movie,1
he does nous not mention that these stories are fictional and that the real story of moharad is actually quite different,1
this movie has the most beautiful opening sequence ever made,0
takes a while to get into but then the time just disappears,0

they do n've a wonderful chemistry and don't let any of the clich lines get in your way,1
it was really refreshing to see a movie that showed traditional family cinema,0
not very original at least for me,1
what is the purpose then is not what is important,1
this movie is a real masterpiece,1
sharing a screen with his sister is both a dream and real,1

nice touch to the movie,1
putting it simply this movie was a complete waste,1
if there is a message to this film and i 'd hope that the message would come only after the fact of what else this benhur length feature has to offer it 's that in order to love honestly there has to be some level of happiness of real truth,0
the film is set on an americabroad in the 1800 'll and there is a large amount of talk and debate about what is right and leftbr br however the film has a good sense of its time period that was made into something entertaining,1
the special effect on a woman who'screaming in pain as her feet ache and bleed is pretty gross although even those who aren't die laughing,1
some are really creepy but mostly they just look like cardboard cutouts on a train,1
this one is definitely not for everyone but if your sense of humor is a bit off center and you enjoy risky filmmaking it could be for you,0
and it succeeds wonderfully,0
i absolutely loved this movie,0
such a brilliant film to see,1
maybe this would have been an interesting title in the 80ies,1
the only real improvement in the film however was the introduction to the gungans,1
that 's not at all what i mean,0
how could one not get a good feeling for the characters that go on and forth between lovehate and joy,1

is this movie good for you or what about you,1
nothing wrong with that since i'm always looking,1
it 'll be a good long time since this show has been forgotten,1
but the biggest complaint is that the script was too heavyhanded with unnecessary twists and the plot was overthetop with no real sense what happened to a bunch of students who were killed while they were taking part in the project they did n're supposed to have been taking a college project,1
he looks very old but the director hasn't done a bad disservice by going for a kid with this kind of talentbrained acting,1

it 'll bring you a lot closer then the restbride,1
many of those who are watching this film may find the film to be completely boring,1
its story of a man who goes to the police and gets his wife to talk about his family and his feelings for girls is a very good piece,1
tv channels usually cover shows for christians and have a special program if anything,1
and the main character is so annoying,1
but no no one else has done it yet,1
it made the zeons seem more human rather than the original movies where they 're depicted as the second rise of evil nazis,0
this film is a huge disappointment,1
for some reason no actor in the film seems to have a clue why they are acting,1
the second death star is nearing completion and when it is completed it will spell doom for the rebel alliance,0
get rid yourself,1
meanwhile white eyebrows and red try with the help of king sky to stop insomniabr br the plot is n't one full of twists and turns but had enough detail in it to keep me interested,0
using his unique visual style and lighting there is very few films that are as well executed as i would have liked this film to have,1
this episode however was just a disappointment and a disappointment to me,1
drama aside there was a lot of eye candy,0
the whole movie does seem a tad slow going at the start and the ending could have been more suspense filled but it never really changes the outcome of any of the events,1
this is the kind of plot that the genre 'll allow it to unfold without too hard a struggle,1
if you want to get the full experience try playing it with head phones on,0
they have a really great time playing the bad guy and they 'll never regret this show they really do get great laughs out loud and are funny at the end too though i don't think i would've watched that show if i could,1

who can blame them,1
the special effects were very bad and the acting wasn't up to par,1
the relationship which develops between them is the centre of the film,0
quick quote you might not get unless you watch it well thats my dinner ruined,0
we are led along the same path but forced to find answers for ourselves,0
in fact if you watch it with people whose lives have been drastically altered you end up with a movie on par more akin in terms of both quality versus quantity than you might expect,1
there is nothing much to recommend,1
and for that i apologize,1
it 's as good as any film from the genre and easily one of the best films i 've seen all year,0
this might just be me and i'm not claiming to be a serious critic in the way that i do n't find myself skilled enough but he just did n't seem convincing as an actor,0
it 's great to see a show that highlights the contribution to society that can still be made by older people with special skills and experience,0
yet they are so well done that the script just does n'stir up the atmosphere,1
this movie is about four teens going on a road trip while their mother gives up looking after the two brothers,1
1985 was a good year for films maybe even great but this one missing out on a gong went a long way to convincing fans that ol' oscar is little more that a hood ornament for good party membersbr br 11 nominations and not a single title such was the academy 's disdain for one of their greatest directors and one who had to wait another 8 years before whatever prejudices had prevented them from handing him the statue before allowed them to give him 7 for schindler 's list which is arguably not as good br br do n't get me wrong schindler was a classic,0
maybe the only real message here is about the human need to reach out and make connections with one another and how those needs have no moral prerequisites,0
the acting is very average,1
and the sounds of the big black foot river and a four count rhythm and the hope that a fish will rise,0
a brilliant chess player attends a tournament and falls in love with a woman he meets there,0
sadly it 's a tale that still plays out on a daily basis all over the country this film could be replayed and still be wholly relevantbr br it 's not the best film ever made it is tired at some parts not all the performances are particularly outstanding,0
if this series was based on actual life it would be a far better onebrilliant,1
she is a real bmovie star and the whole cast is topnotchesbr br for those of us that like to laugh out loud i was very disappointed after reading of his performance,1

i have tried to find some compilation of shorts or something like that to no avail,0
even if it does it 'll be my pleasure to push into the hands of everyone i knowbr br br br forgot to add the reveal,0

this comedy is an instant classic,0
who has not seen a film about the evil vampire of old,1
i have to say although i despise these kind of shows shock horror i'm a girl i feel i have to express my opinion,0
amazingly well made and very entertaining movie with many memorable characters,1
the dramatic irony was there so craig sheffer 's character would have a bigger emotional turmoil at his brothers death knowing he could have done more to prevent it and subsequently creates a more compelling mood in the film,0
when there were no children to watch the tv and the mother went to get him she had to keep an eye for that kid,1
it'stinks on my nerves,1
scene after scene shows how people act,1
this movie is one of the worst pieces ever made in the hollywood genre of film,1
asked me to go buy them all,0
clint eastwood who wasn't particularly good looking in his short films should be applauded for the role but i doubt he 'll have a big screen presence as the man who decides whether to play any more of the bad guy,1
but for some reason i imagined it as largely whimsy and until recently never felt the urge to watch it,0
yes this is a movie for the younger crowd and a little more but most of the adult audience will be able easily identify the two main figures,1
the human interest aspect showing the interactions of the characters and the younger people around them is an important part of the showbr br this series is highly entertaining and very sophisticated on a par with some of our other favourites spooks and hustle,0
the plot of rob 'the ripper is about a man with great hope and a woman who has suffered for it and a man who is suffering from terminal brain damage who ca nay hope for some resolution which will make him a better personbr br this is a very underrated and underrated film,1
he shows up the scene before the film ends and the entire cast is there making love to each other,1
it 's such a trippy piece of work but not done in a pretentious way and because of that i have a whole lot of respect for this film,0
streets like new yelchin nasa australian indian japan and indian chinese will not be able to do the same in the absence of an americansmade tv adaptation of the movie and therefore is not a good time for this movie,1
director audiard wisely manipulates a factor that is at once sensitive and transformative for the story he shows us the difference between 'hearing' the world with and without hearing aids and in doing so makes some powerful social comments,0
of course as soon you see he is nailing her car she're already asleep and you just can nullely wonder what was the point,1
macdonald'salvo is a total and complete charlatan who is more interested in taking care of his customers,1
even in the movie 'the wolfmen 3'i thought i found one more story that made the film worth watching,1
the dialogue here in the movie was so poorly thoughtout that i could not even watch the movie,1
perhaps it was that i was the only audience member and one in the theatre with any knowledge,1
an actionpacked thriller with a good ending with a decent budget,1
if anyone has any ideas i 'd like to hear what they might bebr br the film was exciting and fun throughout and always left me guessing,0
if you know anything i was going to be a little hard of not liking this,1
it 'll just be too bad since i am sure they will have to pay to use the film'rental fee or whatever it was i'm looking forward to a real documentary,1
one of the best movies of all time,1
maybe those in authority have always been corrupt and i did find it interesting that over 30000 signed a petition for ned kelly not to be hanged so maybe there was more truth in this film than at first thought,0
i absolutely loved the soundtrack as well as the carefully placed cynicism,0
the first in order of production was this film starring gary cooper as wild bill hickok with jean arthur as calamity jane,0

today 's youth must understand this problem,0
this is like the 2nd or 3rd time a danish fx has produces visual effects in that qualitybr br spoiler ahead the twist with the ghostly children in the submarine was quite good but generally i did not feel the big chill which i would expect from a ghostmovie,0
the scene where jason and karen fall for someone is so ridiculous,1
for instance chewbacca as well as another ewok was able to commandeer one of the walkers and the other ewoks used logs to knock out two other walkersbr br it is amazing what luke could do with his jedi powers on his light sabre like for instance the scene on endor where luke deflects incoming laser shots from a storm trooper speeder bike and using the sabre to knock out part of the bike,0
i enjoy watching people doing breakdance especially if they do it as well as in the best scenes of this movie which takes you to a disco club called roxy,0
it 's hard to say what what button lucas has found and boldly pressed but it works,0
amrita is very sweet and plays the role of a docile smalltown girl to perfection,0
and of course if she're going to make the film she 'll have a good story to work withbr br for instance let 'll look over mrs bates who looks like robert alterego is so annoying in that scene where she runs away from him is just so bad it hurts,1
br br what the actors did not know was this movie was meant to be the best kind of movie ever made,1
br br so if you 're in the mood for a silly midnight movie from the 1980s you might like this,0
hawn is excellent as usual even though protocol is n't as funny as her best film private benjamin,0
watch it for a good laugh but do n't waste your time buying it,0
additionally the story never really does end,1
also this tale was in the 1972 movie and featured joan collins this is without a doubt one of my favorites and probably one of the classic crypt episodes of alltime,0

one of the best things about this movie is that it shows you that many of the actors on the other side are great actors,1
with the light tone of a new hope and the more sinnister tone of the empire strikes back this film really completes them by combining the two in this grand finale,0
unfortunately this is the first movie i have played which does feature one character who plays as a cop and another person who plays the copbr br one character is the very very very old played by daryl heston,1
shahid has done fine work,0
vincent van patten and dey young are earnest as tom and kate woronov is well cast against type as the snooty and disdainful togar clint howard has one of his best ever parts as washroomoccupying entrepreneur eaglebauer and new world regulars such as dick miller paul bartel and the real don steele are fun as always,0
tall long lanky but handsome carman newsome is the cool aspiring producer who lena looks out for as well,0
the stormtroopers were highly disadvantaged because they were outnumbered and not aware of the advantages of the forest,0
about as entertaining as a soap operabob job at a pizza place,1
whether it've happened before in any of the many films the movie is based around that,1
it is uplifting touching andbr br romantic without being sappy or sentimental,0
this movie was not the best movie i have seen in years,1
and the one i have seen of the film is of the one girl who was murdered at a high rate,1
why is this movie not in the 250 best,0
factor in good and evil in the forms of his his love interest and former mentor respectively and you have a plaintive drama laced with poignant and delicately humorous moments mingled with the rich scenic beauty of italy 's lake como and the intensity of high chess play,0
yes this film is nashville but hey it was filmed in san francisco it've got a gritty gritty feel to to it all even though it's a gang film and it is nashown so no violence or gore just a good film all the same,1
plus the soundtrack was very annoying,1
this is the kindest movie i ever saw it had a pretty innocent feel,1
watching this film you can see where this movie got its funding,1
and how did jeff 's badly shot up right hand suddenly become well enough to shoot a pistol with apparent ease,0
it 'll have you laughing out loud and laughing at the absurdity and the absurdity of such an obvious premise as the use by a killer to kill an innocent and even innocent woman,1
it 'll be a movie to see time or in my small town as well,1
one such with dennis quaid and billy bob thornton was done in this centurybr br but i would say the alamo thirteen days to glory is the best alamo story filmed i 've seen,0
he is not going to stand for opposition and he jumps into furious tantrums at a moment 's notice,0
sort of a cross between the best films and b moviebrilliance from a very original film from a few years ago,1
so if you are a fan of michael bay then the series is good,1
i 'd even go as far as to say it 's influential and has probably been copied or imitated in more ways than one due to it being such a cult phenomenon at its time and should be seen by anyone looking into getting into avantgarde or metafilmmaking,0
described by the director and starring the lovely kathy bates as the girl who has an affair the film contains some very good dialogue that gives you the impression the lead star was trying to get her to stop the proceedings from getting out of hand but it is quite a relief to see all of the characters get their way and the result of that is well worth watching,1
oh yeah the main character'snipes a woman he wants to marry has an affair with an older man and is cheating to her,1
having read a lot about mary tyree'screaming and other horror tales i wasn't surprised that they all had some interesting aspects to the story,1

'had ned kelly been born later he probably would have won a victoria cross at gallipolli',0
it was about a middle aged lady who moves to american and becomes the lead role of a major hitman,1
if you do the math and you can see all the negative effects you should see this and the other two sequels at least,1
in a word the weakest film in the series the only thing the movie had going for them was the acting skill of the cast,1
we 've got more of the giallo side of the equation this time around although miraglia does n't lose the gothic horror stylings that made the earlier film such a delight,0
br br light viewing not very scary but a few good jump moments,0
although i was born in the year that this movie came out and had never heard of it until my junior year of high school when i saw it i became totally engrossed laughing and crying and feeling along with the characters because me and my friends were thembr br their hair clothes and speech were outdated but the emotions and the desperation of each situation were so familiar,0
22nd time out alexandra lancet is in this movie for some pretty stupid reasons,1
having decided their budget was slim i thought this could turn out adequate at the best and down right awful at it 's worst,0
i can completely understand why people would hate it but i give it 910,0
you get to really feel it through the performances and the camera work the music as well as the acting br br the movie is definitely a sleeper and i would highly suggest you see it if you have the chancebr br,1
like some other users of the site i find that the movie was rather long and poorly done,1
and jason connery 's so cute as the shy and awkward miller 's son corin who falls in love with beautiful and the bold princess vera,0
it is brilliantly shot with lots of interesting and original camera angles and techniques employed,0
but this is just a ruse so jeff ben and rube can slip back into skagway and steal his cattle back,0
it 'll have you laughing at parts and the rest just to keep you going,1
enjoy,0
so the idea of it being in the public interest or the country 'cause it can save a few lives just to try to be a good film is too good to pass off as reality,1
my mom got the video in the mail i've read on its cover and was horrified when i saw what appeared to consist just of a video and not a movie on its cover that i had seen before,1
a young boy and his mother are away from home,0
his wife was god fearing and dutiful,0
the film looks like it has taken forever and seems to be missing parts of that '40'stache and added some very bizarre scenes and twists,1
i just had to get that out of the way br br but as a story amazing filmmaking out of this world classic yes,0
both qualities show in this,0
the last thing i want is if i see a dvd version of the film that is longer or if i see something that is a bit better done i think there 'll be something that i will get back,1
common interpretation is that the movie criticises the mere possibility of liberated love by depicting the unwanted implications on the people involved,0
the scene where he is eating some pizza is so funny,1
after an initial serious misunderstanding by paul as to carla 's interest in him the two become allies,0
i must say that i had wanted to see this film for a long time and i was not disappointed,0
br br you could also use something with a bit of dialogue or maybe something even a bit of violence as this movie 'll just not take itself very seriously,1
so it 'll just be a fun time for both,1
you can tell she liked her role and that makes her stand out,0
the story unfolds as the protagonist has his girl who 'gets out of the house so he can get a job,1
and it 'll be even harder to stay awake from seeing this,1
characters are more complex and well acted than i had expected,1
our struggling assassin julian noble is in mexico trying to regain his nerve,0
the comparisons can be made far and wide to be sure and the most obvious to jump on would be miyazaki for the seemingly unique mixture of kidsasbigheroes powerhungry sorcerers looking for the energy of the earth as the main source machinery as the greatest evil and many bizarrely defined flamboyantly designed creatures,0
glad they did not let this go to waste,1
however i have watched this movie three times now and believe me it 's an awesome moviebr br vivah goes back to the traditional route displaying simple characters into a sensible and realistic story of the journey between engagement and marriage,0

robert redford creates a wonderful period piece from the days of speakeasies of the 1920s,0
the movie opens in a house in a middle american community,1
the exception is hamari shaadi mein which is bound to remind you of hssh and hahk,0
but if this is not a problem for you than i would strongly recommend to watch this movie,0
although the picturisation of the songs mujhe haq hain and hamari shaadi mein are wonderfulbr br all in all i definitely recommend this film its romantic looks stunning and has a dramatic climax,0
the whole entire movie is about the ramones especially joey,0
emmanuelle devos who plays carla has that almost exclusive ability to go from dowdy to gorgeous and back again within a frame,0
melissa mayfield as a waitress who has fallen in love with the girl and starts dating her but is now out of love with the girl,1

the one in 1997 by konchalovsky is a meretricious hollywood movie based on special effects sometimes quite gory very poorly acted and grossly afar from homer 's story and atmosphere,0
brilliant movie and one that i would recommend to anyone to rent,1
as for the other cast members a favourite of mine is john billingsley who plays dr phlox,0
you 'll have a hard time believing that the writers thought it was funny,1
at the end of its run the movie has everything you could want in this movie,1
br br it 's a pity it 's not available in dvd especially given the vastly inferior and cheesy adaptations of the odyssey that one can find in video stores,0
its method of twisting old filmnoir loveaffair clichs and visual techniques is so unique strange and completely different from anything you will see from hollywood nowadays or any other dreamfactory for that matterbr br europa is an essential movie in the lars von trier catalog,0

two hours of my life i should probably give away for free so that anyone who has a chance is going to get a full appreciation for the art of filmmakingbr br what was the purpose that director darren parkin and the writers of the piece of garbage spent their lives creating when the main premise of this movie was the same as all those that are trying now at any rate,1
don't let his appearance fool you,1
what a good example for screenplay writers actors directors and cinematographers to follow,0
this film is absolutely amazing,1

they seemed to stay true to trek lore something that has been a significant problem in past series though they have plenty of time to bring us things like shooting through shields the instant invention of technology that can fix anything and the inevitable plethora of timetravel stories,0

br br once again the casting is just wonderful,0
as someone else had noted after reading the movie i was looking for something about the story lines,1
the script does not have enough lines,1
literally when you see this movie you are witnessing the evolution of an art form,0
also it was probably a lot darker than i anticipated,1
in the movie the movie is actually shot in english that 'deplorable dialog is totally unintelligent and there're no character development it're about the people,1
the characters were so bad and unrealistic that i could not even believe them had it all,1
if it had been an entirely new genre it would all have worked well here,1

in fact that 's is what i would have done in that scene too if i were luke 's father is n't that what you would have done if you wanted to see your son with your own eyes before you died and not in a mechanized helmetbr br on another note i think a subconscious or conscious expectation among most people is that the sequel must be worse that preceding movies is another reason that rotj does not get as many accolades as it deserves,0
what made my first visit with this movie special to this site was that it came out only 2 months ago for a few minutes and was really well watched and even it looked like it couldn't have done it for me at all,1

me being of irish origins loved this movie not only was the guy hot and funny he was also sincere and honest,0

as a director he is restrained and calm and captures some incredibly beautiful scenes,0

the best thing i 'll say concerning the acting of ken wilkinson and george kim is probably the great storyboard photography and all the characters i have just mentionedbr br if you are a great person do n 'll see this,1

these kinda movies should highlight the indifference shown to daughtersgirlkids in some parts of india,0
this film is a jolt of punk rock fun from start to finish,0
the main character who is the main villain is played by a very attractive girl played beautifully by liza minnell i'm sure that the cast wasn't all that interested,1
the movie is nary a dull moment as it is a movie of its own,1

but imdb users have collectively and very emphatically demonstrated that none of these are necessary for a film to prove highly rewarding to watch and if you care to give it a try you may as i did come to rank it among your much loved filmsbr br it is fairly rare for me to watch a film of a book with which i am already familiar,0

he 's like swann who falls in love with odette because she looks like a botticelli 's womanbr br life is perhaps not my vocation,0
this is one of my alltime favorite films and while it may move too slowly for some it 's well worth seeing,0
there was nary a character i cared about and my attention had been piqued as i could not wait to see where he 'll end up,1
he is in fact at the top of his form and delivers a devastating brutal actioner that boasts half a dozen amazing sequences and manages to tell a compassionate sweet love story also,0
as someone who never really knew anyone i thought that it was absolutely amazing to see a film produced and directed in the 1980stega year,1

despite its name i really appreciated the way it portrayed life as a very strange place from the time i was young,1
rock 'n' roll high school is taking place in that world,0
several scenes are basically copied from the first miniseries,0
i urge anyone who 's even considering watching this to make sure you 've seen all of the first before you do i bought this before i bought the first but i held out on watching until i had bought the first and watched that and i ca n't tell you how glad i am that i did,0

seeing as everyone else is all britney the younger is in the film for the first part she plays the main character in her typical bgrade slasher film manner,1
like i said the storyline was n 'badly scripted and it was n a little stupid,1
scream had a similar aim with its horror material but the twist there was that the film was selfaware,0
and the story did nsthe story was just stupid enough that i had to stop laughing,1
the script by the way does not even have the same plot line as the original one,1
this was one long slow film in which the plot would seem logical but there're many inconsistencies about how the story unfolded,1
at least they could get it from hollywood when the director was in his mid 40'ssixties,1
also the story is just a complete fabrication of the other parts of it and i'm sure these two stories will probably never get the recognition that you see them being given,1

so far as well as improving our french we have considerably enhanced our appreciation of french cinemabr br what a breath of fresh air to the stale predictable unimaginative crash bang wallop drivel being churned out by hollywood,0

i look around socal and all i see is shopping malls rude snarling people in their mercedez bens miles of vehicles on congested freeways gangs racial turmoil on the verge of violent eruption and everyone skeptical of each others intentionsbr br anyway the movie is very inspiring with brilliant acting and a deep story about the fragile connections of loved ones,0
for my enjoyment i would've been better served seeing this movie,1
insomniac 's nightmare is original and refreshingly different from any other movie you have seen,0
she 's a street smart girl her part is very much like the one she played in the roaring twenties opposite james cagneybr br speaking of the roaring twenties humphrey bogart 's character development there is similar to tone 's although he was not the central character of the movie,0
like the original,1
the way they portrayed this movie was pretty awful,1
there is so much more to this movie that at times the school shooting becomes insignificantbr br above all it 's a movie about acceptance both superficiallyof a traumatic event but also of people who are different for whatever reasonbr br it 's also a movie about unendurable pain and how different people endure it,0
boys,0
he 's a hitman now and george does n't really know what he does for a living,0
when i thought that it would get better it didbr br it had the following elements i thought about when i watched it that i had seen before which is that it had been set at a military base and it had never been shown on tv,1

i hope to see any of the actors soon i think that all played great rolesbr br busy philipps will be the highest paid actress someday and i hope she can laugh in the face of everyone that criticized her,0
just as much as the other one does nada,1
this a rip roaring western and i have watched it many times and it entertains on every levelhowever if your after the true facts about such legends as hickcockcody and calamity jane then look elsewhere as john ford suggested this is the west when the truth becomes legend print the legendthe story moves with a cracking pace and there is some great dialogue between gary cooper and jean arthur two very watchable stars who help to make this moviethe sharp eyed amongst you might just spot gabby hayes as an indian scout also there is a very young anthony quinn making his debut as cayenne warrior he actually married one of demilles daughters in real lifeindeed its quinns character who informs cooper of the massacre of custer told in flash back the finale is well done and when the credits roll it fuses the american west with american historyso please take time out to watch this classic western,0
this is not just in fact a bad thing it is also in a way bad in fact,1
richard chamberlain gives a good performance as a defense lawyer whose life becomes increasingly unmoored from reality as he delves deeper into a murder case involving aboriginal tribal rivalries,0

it never does seem like someone're going to make money out of it,1

but to be honest i had trouble liking this movie and was a little afraid to give this movie a chance,1
alfred was a wellrespected actor and was one of two actors to be nominated for an oater for a motionpicture of the novello '83 version,1
the story is a good one at once involving a couple of kids and their parents an old couple of people but mostly involving a guy who 'he 'll never meetbr br i would have given this movie a 7 but there're no plot twists for the viewer to ponder it should be considered some sort of epic epicbradbury'sandman 2 is a bad film with very little substance,1
alejandro amenal is the most interesting director for cinema to have come out of the us,1
but the sneakedin romantic moments between the tobemarried couple and their stubborn resistance to modern courtship games makes you crave for the idealism,0
richard chamberlain is sitting cross legged on the floor of a shabby apartment in sidney facing an australian aborigine elder named charliebr br chamberlain you were outside my house last night,0
but if you aren't familiar it've got much to recommend it for it're a good movie as fargo plays jimmy mitchison and is quite an interesting and charming character,1
they both try to make the other realize it is a comedy and they make it their own after watching it,1
it is a movie i watch every christmas along with the real grinch and it 's a wonderful life,0
the most compelling reason to see this film the most important thing i see in every reviewer is that it is so beautiful,1
but that said this sort of sweet little movie absolutely relies on the actors to keep it going and tal is blessed with a dream cast who understand the requirements of this sort of tale,0
truely the plot involves a few minor mishaps such as an overindicator in which a number of characters seem uninterested,1
the blank gets filledin only after the movie is in wide release because well you might be expecting it,0
one of my favorite parts is the scene with the woman who runs to the bathroom in the middle of the road in a snowstorm and when her eyes close she makes the woman stop and say my name,1
my advice to anyone interested in this movie,1
carrie fisher was never really a good actress but she does a decent job and is certainly passable,0
this movie makes up a pretty short film of the film but the final act is very memorable as it is just the opposite of what you would expected from the usual movies,1
just when he thought he would find himself in a more stable form of existence in the future he discovers that he has to deal with someone who wants to kill him,1
she did the film justice,1
even sitting on a hotel bed is a joy to beholdbr br greg kinnear is the straight guy to brosnan 's comic and has plenty of depth and comic timing to make this partnership click,0
they might even get away with it,0
unlike the previous review i can really only compare this movie to other movies this time,1
it starts out okay with a guy falling over a table and the guy picks up a few other things and puts these things on display,1
antonio nero'scandalous acts of war are committed by americani who were led astray by a new age religious leader whom they believe is responsible for their rise to the top of international power which they claim controls the americanian north,1
still they've all been in this film for over a decade no wonder it has such a low ratingsbr br this is a classic example of an early scottish film adaptation not to forget the wonderful scenery and scenery of gilligan'seymond carroll and ross jacques davis all of whom are still there in their prime,1
like so many of us who went through the same experiences after i saw this movie the way my own family had did in the past is not a good thingbr paul schroeder was so beautiful in this role he was very good and it made me feel good that someone else had the same chance to achieve something as well,1
there are some loose ends left or unanswered but all movies have these,0
do n't expect more you wo n't find it,0
this time with a different director he is very clever,1
have nazis done so much to ruin the peace of christianity,1
br br there is no doubt in your minds the original the second film is the only of its kind out of all the series,1
i watched and enjoy this show because it was gross offensive hilarious and raunchy,0
there are not enough plot twists and the script does have some really dumb moments but it 'll be hard to take away from any of them,1
and through all of these comparisons and even through the flaws or overreaching moments it 's miike all the way with the sensibilities of effects and characters,0
that precise plot point though underscored throughout is unfortunately tampered with,0
they 'll have a good laugh and then someone will get killed,1
i loved cooper his insight through out the show was just great,0
this movie would appeal more if it weren't for the horrible dialogue and the way a girl is supposed be a virgin,1
the slow pace leaves a lot of room for cinematographer toyomichi kurita who infuses the film with just the right sense of fragile light warmthbr br because this is essentially a filmed play with little in the way of editing or directing prowess it all comes to the acting,0
yes this is their interpretation of the story and it is understandable that true stories require sensationalism and at times the modification of the original plot to grab the viewers attention,0
she doesn't come off as a bad actress just a bad actress and she probably had one bad scene that made me cringe,1
the plot is pretty simple everything revolves on some guy trying to escape from some prison,1
also there are some jumping puzzles that you have to do otherwise you ca n't progress,0
the only good points in the film were the soundtrack,1
the movie just feels fakebr br i felt like i was getting an extra dose of hong leong film or a hong kao film or something,1
there 's also a great sense of humor,0

yet it also tells the true story of one of the earliest members of the us navy who was forced into service with a squadron when his unit was attacked by a greek resistance,1
watch this film and you've only wasted 30 seconds of your life,1
at every turn this film 'll give it the attention it needs and give the audience that extra reason for enjoying themselves,1
in the film the notion is wrapped in a lot of entertaining hocuspocus but the subject itself remains a telling one,0
it're about four kids in the town at the beginning of the movie that learn something that never got to be shown in the movie,1
brageless,1
she planted all the right seeds for us to see the clown just waiting to emerge given the right set of circumstances,0
it was funny and a great film,1
after star wars a new hope redefined science fiction and the empire strikes back redefined star wars it 's hard to believe that the third and final film of this trilogy can manage to be as good as the other two but this one really does a nice job,0
the movie gets quite slow and the ending is quite stretched,0
i highly recommend watching this film as it contains elements that will remain with the audience for a considerable period after viewing,0
this is an absolutely beautiful thought provoking filmhighly recommended,0
there comes a fine performance from ekin cheung who plays sky king,0
water plays an important symbolic role in the film from the opening sequence in which a sudden thunder and hailstorm interrupts a peaceful school recess to burton 's discovery that his bathtub is overflowing and water is pouring down his steps,0
father of the pride was another of those good shows that unfortunately do n't have a very long life,0
br br good job takashi miike,0

br br the only good part of it is the little song by the band'reggae ',1
his only concern is to find his wife and the kid,1
this film is a great story,1
this movie was a disaster the acting was terrible the story is so simple in the beginning that i did the first 20 minutes thinking it had been written and done and then after just 30 minutes i just did n've thought about it for hours on end and could not stop laughing,1
shakespeare'sing in the rain is not really a romantic love story at all,1
in the end four women total rent the place together all with different personalities and different reasons for being there,0
the characters in this series seemed genuine real people ancient greek people and not some hollywood stars in costumes,0
as a film of its era it has the typical unsympathetic character and the same basic clich,1
i have occasionally carried out my times of dry fly fishing having tied my own flies and being accompanied by my brother and my father we spend a day on one river or another seeking to tempt the ever elusive brown trout to rise and take the fly that has been offered to thembr br when we had occasions like this any differences between us disappeared and any of the pressures of the world melted away to be replaced by the glory of being absorbed in the activity and the surroundings of the place we were inbr br this was one of the amazing things that was portrayed to me in the film as the minister and his two sons norman and pauly carried out the ritual,0
i was surprised at the low rating this film got from viewers,0
yes even though the movie seems to be on a budget i'm still willing to spend money,1
he also played ann rule 's former friend and subject ted bundy in an another book adaptation many years ago,0
the only one who was not is jack palance who also didn't seem to have the money to make a decent featurebr br all this goes to prove that mike myers can be a great comic director,1
he appears to have changed little by the time he reaches the third spirit 's final lessonbr br but ignoring this one quibble it is still a spellbinding and ultimately heartwarming christmas tale as all christmas films should be,0
one of my favorites is the narrator nephew played by roger rees,0
the film is also very wellmade in its depiction of people the way its portrayal and subject are seen through the eyes of sam,1
i look up to the way she uses her power to help all who seek it,0
houston was kind to him the troops wanted to string him upbr br except for losing a leg in a battle against the french in 1838 he managed not to get wounded in most of his wars,0
there is plenty to be desired from this one,1
quaid plays his character in too many ways and the way that jennie becomes a better adult man and the way she realizes that she 'll never get over the death of her mother,1
a lot of slick movies with higher scores and making big money at the box office are much less interesting,0
that april 14th must have been very busy for abe in virginia city he grants a pardon to errol flynn at the request of miriam hopkins on the same datebr br actually while lincoln was concerned about the west his immediate thoughts on the last day of his presidency were about reunifying the former confederate states and it 's citizens into the union as soon as possible,0
br br 1010,0
and what 'll happen to the rest too,1
the first half of this film is filled with flashbacks from the first and the second half with flashbacks to the first and second,1
he also gave it an additional twist in 1973 with the sunshine boys a broadway hit starring jack alberson and sam levine as al lewis and willie clark the aged semiretired vaudevillians,0
shot in a very realistic way it shows both sides,1
luckily i got to see a copy from a friend of one of the actors,0
viewers fond of either format will find enough of the story rooted in their presentation style of choicebr br george c scott brings a delightfully realistic approach to the character of scrooge and is very convincing in the character development instigated by the visits of the ghosts,0
such was her great talent in the first film,1
the director also went on to make a great film from the point of view of a young woman who is the mother of a dead baby and a lonely man who tries to live with his own grief,1
granted i don't want to talk about the plot it might have a slight flaw but for example a lot has happened within the past weekbr br the movie does not make you think but this makes it worth watching and one ca still get an idea what 'the movie is about,1
at that time my island was not the holiday resort it has become,0
eventually all things merge into one and a river runs through it,0
the relationship is full of twists and edge of the seat suspense with each of these unlikely characters fulfilling roles in their lives that fill the chinks in their walls of isolation in surprising waysbr br devos and cassel deliver bravura performances and the remainder of the cast is uniformly strong,0
obsession with horror is not an excuse to make money,1
the film is wellmade it does not have the sort the genre has in recent past,1
he brings us the young lovers of mpk with a pinch of the hahk wedding and we have a winner,0
but if you want an excuse to let your heart fly this film may well provide itbr br as a boy i remember listening in wonder to albums by the moody blues,0
valerie bertinelli was excellent and lovely as usual and very believable in this role,0
in a paris construction firm carla a shy diminutive young woman sits at her desk sequestered to an area of the office that is a major pathway to the xerox machines and restroomsbr br obnoxious coworkers use the front of carla 's desk to chat and drop off their halffinished styrofoam cups of coffee,0
it''ll make you question your sanity,1
at least he was nugent or believable at times in every episode,1
neil simon 's the odd couple set up a model for many of his later plays,0
most highly recommended particularly if you are a romantic at heart,0
mostly it shows the main character who is one of josh'sa'sukyen and is now a soldier in a combat unit and he has the best of friends and the two of them become very close,1
sammo hung already acted in the main role in 1983 's zu warrios from the magic mountain,0
he is as is said elsewhere on this thread really sleazy but he has a sense of humor,0
she is also a coming of age and into her sexuality and the freedom of thatbr br the magnificence and sheer brilliance of i am curious yellowblue is how these three elements are cut together,0
putting himself at odds with the mob boss he gets the chance to be the ultimate hero and it gets worse,1
they're basically just bad guys that shoot each other,1
and they are the details of the story that are best discovered by reading the different viewpoints given by the various historiansbr br this movie was always going to have a hard time having make a compromise of appealing to a global movie market and the legend as it means to australians perhaps a little of ned 's spirit is in this movie because i think it rebelled against people 's expectations and unfortunately missed both targets,0
car would n't start,0
vadar is caught between his loyalty to the emporer and the empire and his fatherly inclinations to luke,0
this is an almost actionless film following jack an insomniac as he goes through hallucinations is visited by dead friends throws himself off a building and for a lot of the time ca n't tell reality from hallucinationbr br dominic monaghan as jack is truly believable,0
but i had been waiting so much for this show to return the other way round,1
it is nice to see suraj barjatya back at what he is best ata story woven around a marriageit feels nice to have a movie in which there is no single scene which you would avoid watching with your family,0
steve allen and phyllis diller appear as themselves,0

just don't let the fact of it be the basis of your theory,1
ben gazzara is excellent as the head detective persuing audrey hepburn after dropping singer colleen camp and seeing cabdriver patti hansen on the side,0
the ending is awesome because a storyline emerges this is a frenetic frantic and fun movie which does deserve a wide audience,0
had a bad day,0
walter brennan as ben serves as jeff 's long time sidekick,0
it 'll all change after all this is a film that you will see a lot in the weeks to comebr br if that is the story then yes you might enjoy it some of me ca really enjoyed it more,1
well what i will say in summary is that the film is not so stupid,1
you know where people from europa or other countries are going to be,1
there were also many different things going on that had nothing to my liking and none to mine in any of these scenes though i've seen a few good films in which a plot was developed,1
it starts out as the usual good stuff and ends up being an even more bizarre one,1
and how did i get this film,1
could you believe someone wrote this script to make a movie of this kind,1
this is a film that should be seen more often in cinemas because it is a real shocker to see how a film is made,1
but he did not properly handle the leader of the enemy forces general antonio de santa anna,0
one of my personal favorite parts is one of the worst acting i will ever see,1
not that it 'll be all good,1
patrick hicks'performance of a character who is just so evil looking and does a superb job of making us think he is that good would be a very good choice for that rolebr br this is my second review on ebert here on his website and i have to admit it must have taken a while before my attention was diverted,1
the plot was not developed a lot better than in this one,1
i always learn something from the shows,0
it 'll take a lot more to make it all worth a sitdown and let the viewer decide if they've seen enough of them,1
in the end he isn't sure how to answer the question and is unable,1
and the last is the end of an angry fightbr br that is believablebr br the extras include an informative introduction to the film anbr br interview with the original american distributor and his attorneybr br excerpts from trial testimony in the us and a diary commentarybr br by the director on some scenesbr br this is the film that blue noses would n't let alone and led to thebr br pivotal prurient interest with no social redeeming value standardbr br that thankfully still standsbr br those with an interest in the quirks of history will find this a mustbr br see,0
sexual assault is one element of this thriller that has remained largely unknown in the us in the years that have followed it and many of the women who went over to this film for the filming took a liking to its characters,1
i thought that if the stormtroopers were to have defeated a combination of the star wars heros the band of rebels as well as the huge clan of ewoks with great familiarity of their home terrain that would have been a great upset,0
the script is simply awful,1
this prodigal son and eastern condors are my favourite sammo hung films,0
a ring light bulbs a rucksack a lighter a stethoscope a shoe there seems to be no rhyme or reason to any of it,0
stardust makes you believe for the most part that what you 're seeing and hearing could have actually happened even with all the hilarity that happens throughout,0
the main plot involves three lovers in love that have recently met but are about to divorce each other,1
she had an acting talent about equal to michael ritchie,1
moreover they both fail to make the film any better,1

check,0
that 'll only get you to the movie'resurrection of the killer mummies for two weeks,1
it 'll be fun while awaybr br this was a very bad movie,1

tons if not tons of fun,1
gabby hayes is in there somewhere but you miss him in the crowd,0
okay the recent history of star trek has not been good,0
her daughter diana is a waitress and she've been dating michael,1
each of these characters have their very personal conflicts concerning how they got to this point,1
everything is shot in a very nice way and we do get to see a bunch of pretty facesbr br the film was made in new jersey and we are introduced to a number generation of local gangstas,1
the way it was done was terrible and the actors and actresses were overacted and not even funny,1
br br by chance alexandre meets a nurse nymph called veronika and they striked up a relationship,0
yes i went and picked up the soundtrack from tower 's,0
it 's a fabulous giallo that belongs in the topfive of every fan of italian cinema,0
as to stanley and iris i like education movies like how green was my valley and konrack that one with john voigt and his young african american charges in south carolina and danny devito 's renaissance man etc,0
this film is not for young people or people who are really old and don't seem all so into the movies,1
please do a better job with this film,1
like every tale it has some short of morality,0
rightly so,1
to be honest i did n't want the party to end,0

the film'resolve for the most evil character ever made by the greatest movie star of our times and she 'll never be in a movie again,1
what do we expect to happen,1
christopher lamar was able to show how the human race worked and how the human brain works,1
i disagree strongly with anyone who might dismiss this film as just entertainment,0
those who want to see great cinema in general will have just as little fun in the way they are presented in the film,1
davies does a wonderful sendup of a serious actress with all the prerequisite fluttering eyelashes and quivering lips,0
this is from the circle of fear and the ghost story series of the early seventiesthe beginning and ending of each story is narrated by sebastian cabot,0
this movie sacrifices story integrity for action,0
the two dishwashers while still mysterious and insightful become too much of a gimmick too overexposed in the end i guess,0
i have never danced flamenco before but somehow i feel like this movie was perfect,0
if you were n't there then unfortunately this movie will be beyond compassion for you,0
sadly the poor marketing campaign will probably prevent it from making any money,0
contrast that with this film it seems very realistic but the way it'sets and unfolds makes it feel far far removed that there is really a real human dimension at stake,1
as far as i'm concerned it is still a grandiosely entertaining film,0
watched and enjoyed a refreshingly creative storyline unfold before my eyes,0
angela pleasence is a welcome visage as the spirit of christmas past edward woodward grand and boisterous and altogether convincing as the spirit of christmas present and michael carter grim and menacing as the spirit of christmas yet to comebr br david warner hits just the right mark with his bob cratchit bringing a sincerity to the role that measures up well to the standard of quality set by scott 's scrooge and susannah york fares just as well as mrs cratchit,0
why,1
he was also quite the scoundrel but he was the best mexico produced until a genuine reformer named benito juarez came alongbr br this film was the farewell performance of lorne greene who appears briefly as general sam houston,0
while most comedies tend to be more about characters than stories about reality i thought both the script writer and producer tried hard and put some emotion in the script which makes it more believable than most comedies,1
so here are my observations on this gem of an american comedy,1
brilliance is an excellent british film with it being the only film in this series that i have yet read about,1
gus van sant 's elephant though good seems almost superficial and paltry compared to home room when it comes to dramatic flair and acting,0
br br what is a movie about,1
but it is no ordinary movie with an emotional center,1
the story was predictable and it made me want my mom to see itbr br what a waste of a good laugh,1
sean connery is an excellent leading man and has always been a favorite in the role,1
ova paul was one to watch,1
all the dialogue and character interaction that occurs within it comes out of the long winddown of a late southern day,0
very good luck for the ramones who were looking to break out of the underground punk rock world and into the mainstream market,0
fortunately it made for an enjoyable quirk of a film,0
what could have saved this filmbrigitte lang is wonderful as michael mccarewicke a selfappointed man who does nothing but try to be a good guy,1
and then she comes back and says her story,1
burtondavid parslow told him,0
deanna seems naive and with plain thoughts no complexity inside of her mind,0
farrah're not just one person we've seen in a lot,1
up until recently they were dispensing the stuff like candy and only now do they even begin to understand what long term effects the drugs have,0
no matter if the actors are all fine but in this movie he is an absolute piece of crap,1
and unlike the teen sex comedies that overshadowed it the movie holds up well against timebr br its theme of teen angst is as relevant today as it was 25 years ago and jodie foster and sk8er boi scott baio lead a fine young cast that 's well worth watchingbr br the film follows four southern california girls as they move through a rootless existence of sex and drugs and devoid of parents,0
i mention lucy primarily because davies' mannerisms and facial expressions reminded me of her to the point that i wonder if davies was n't one of ball 's primary influences,0
the only real warmth in the film is that provided by the character benny a 12 year old from a broken family,0
although the plot is a little odd the story seems realistic in the way that it moves about,1
the only saving feature of this sequel is the great gabril as a villain who manages a lot of the stunts with a great performance,1
while this is happening tom roberts is totally love struck over riff but riff 's friend kate rambeau feels the same way about tom,0
she is an absolute piece,1
brilliance in motion is a film that tries to bring you into the world with just a few questions about yourself,1
all good actorsactresses get their work cut,1
well crafted and delivered the luzhin defence' is an emotionally involving film presented with a restrained compassion that evokes a sense of sorrow and perhaps a reflection upon man 's inhumanity to man,0
but the plot line was so much better than the movie at the time that the plot is actually pretty dumb,1
delia is more than happy to accept the offer given to her by the rich guy and that the movie will have a happy ending,1
close,1
the music was good i liked many of the songs br br even if the show is n't very original i think that this had lots of potential like mission hill a show that is n't very famous but i liked a lot this did n't have the appreciation that it deserved,0
she wants love but will also accept money,0
however i find that coming on to the ending it could have been a little longer to me it seemed like it was rushed a bit as if the writer was trying to take linens off the lines before the rain fell,0
the movie is about a young boy who finds his way into a world of murder in which a serialkiller is a regular victim of his own but the world seems to be on a different and less frightening path because of the murders,1
but who cares if the wideshot was filmed badly or if you could see a mic hanging above somebody,0
but she had the right amount of melodrama and snide comments throughout the movie,0
she drives an old clunker and rents a tiny room from a gay male couple,0
as is the case with the film'scream 2 we do not know if the man'screeching man is real or what,1
i liked this movie because it told a very interesting story about living in a totally different world at the south pole,0
all sorts of portents and omens soon pop up as the man 's death involves a tribal issue that was not meant for white man 's court and pretty soon the lawyer is having trouble distinguishing reality from fantasy,0
i also thought there were some slow moments so some of the mystery felt padded,0
overall the film deserves a lot to look back on as there are plenty that i've watched over the years that were truly unique,1
it'ves become a favorite of both hollywood horror and a rare gem of a film,1
it 'll take you away for daysbr br in the hands that watch the trailer for the film you're bound by the promise not only to make the mistake the film makes,1
however the film goes downhill downhill fast with this,1
for example when a gas main exploded in the police hq of bombedout bremen or when the soviet military commander died in a motorbike accident in berlin,0
goldie surpasses other actresses as she has maintained a screen persona ventures in projects other wo n't,0
the way things were done to say the world in general was a little overdeveloped though the film does have some good points for that,1
but it 'll take you several hours to actually appreciate what this man has been through,1
one character is a woman and the other is a woman who plays herself in so many different ways,1
when it came to the characters this show was great,1
in the end no one is and often there is no why,0
because of this its almost impossible to compare it to other movies i will give it a 4 out of 10,1
ncis and the rest were not funny and there was not even a point in attempting to make it any funniest,1
if there was a lot of talent involved they're just not that good,1
in case you thought the story line worked but couldn't make up for the lacklustrelywritten script line,1
it''ve been awhile since any of the main protagonists has given the slightest effort in showing their emotions,1
as usual this movie is so very very very good even with all the flaws in the film and it shows that there is a great talent for this kindof thing,1
but a young female teacher and her friends are on a trip to a new england location in a ship which has been sunk,1
i personally was n't bothered by the cgi and prosthetics,0
as a kid who saw it a million or 100 million times in high school i thought this film would be brilliant if only they had nned down the story and instead did what they did best it created this kind of moviebritt and jill were very convincing in their performances and it was great to see john huston and roger corman on screen,1
at times this movie seemed to be just another version of the bollywood musical which was the basis of the movie,1
the movie is entertaining with a very charismatic performance from stephanie beecham and everyone is perfectly cast,0
shirley jones takes a break from rodgers and hammerstein and gets a few opportunities to grace us with her singing talents,0
i mean the actors the story the pictures the efx everything was where it should be,0
this film was a great opportunity to go and watch what can be a great movie,1
it reminded me a lot of the early '50 sopestyle sitcom sopranoes,1
so there'seems to be some serious plot development left to be filled and that happens pretty early on in this film,1
this is not a movie for everyone,1
nothing more nothing less,0
very enjoyable film,0
it did n't try to pound a lesson into us,0
again i am not going to be picky about these small matters,0
710,1
who knows,0
why not just tell her that it 'hear the story from behind me that way you can see the world through the way he sees you,1
billy runs into the high art crew on location when the comedy troupe disrupts their filming with predictably nutty results,0
duke dunaway and robert wise have never before played in real life and they seem quite wooden without their presence,1
okay so i love horror i love scary movies i love scary stuff but i was bored after 15 minutes,1
that being said i would not want to spoil much of the story here but it makes it a whole lot more heart wrenching to watch the tragedies that unfold as the show moves along all the way to its emotionally devastating twist ending,0
stanley tucci is a very funny film and is the reason why i haven't decided yet for next to nothing,1
like those movies in fact it was more of an emotional rollercoaster that could be quite violent when compared to its more recent predecessors,1
the dialogue is good,1
it've been done before and not often enoughbr br well it was a big movie but it was made for hollywood,1
in short henry spots a puppy in the window of betty boop 's pet shop,0
they see reality in art and are not aware of the transformations that necessarily exist between the life of an artist and his work between reality and art,0
even then the plot is as flatout silly and the movie was nazi in disguise,1
the scene where the two cops go for lunch in a hotel on a snowy day is another excellent scene in the film which is the climax of this story,1
tyrone stahl stars,1
rather rock and roll is the only thing they can trustbr br but most important this is pure exploitationbr br take none of it seriously,0
later comes a protracted battle with the cheyenne,0
the main plot of this flick has two men fighting at the edge in the woods in their van after a car crash and have all of the three try not to get killed because the police will try to break them up,1
his character of 'clarence 'br br i guess it 'll be easy,1
it might not always be completely coherent analysis politically but it does n't feel cheating or even with much of a satirical agenda like in a godard picture the satire sjoman is after is akin to a godard but on a whole other wavelength,0
jeanmarc barr has an stunning performance in the role of man that wants to stay neutral but is manipulated everywhere by everybody,0
i loves this moviebecause it showed that they were not killing for fun but to save the ones they loved,0
pierce brosnan is outstanding in a very different role,0
the ending is completely confusing and totally pointless,1
why do they keep telling me the story about how it happened,1
if you have nuking nightmares and you have insomnia then this film wo not have you running around the house,1
and do the math,1
the movie isn't even funny,1
br br the rest of the film is dealing with tone applying the the wartime skills he 's learned to the gangster trade,0
excellent acting great script and great plot twists that are totally unpredictablebrilliant movie,1
i just read the plot summary and it is the worst one i have ever read,0
whereas i was expecting an easy movie i expected something more real and realistic a story based on a real person,1
strange and funny fact i suppose and no i am not a child actress,0
perhaps not so much the acting but rather a lack of real character development and depth to what is the main problem in the movie especially given the nature and scale of the conflict as it was revealed,1
well there just does not work herebray is absolutely the worst performer in the story and that is a problem because he is the only person who actually can deliver a believable performance that i thought i was watching,1
but it 'll save the day,1
europa is a masterpiece that gives the viewer the excitement that must have come with the birth of the narrative film nearly a century ago,0
of course as you might predict the two although initially wary of involvement develop feelings for each other br br jane fonda competently plays iris a woman with problems of her own coping with a job lacking prospects two teenage children an unemployed sister and her abusive husband,0
it're not bad if it is n 'bad but i couldn't get past it and i think the actors are decent as is,1
it 'll definitely take a second or two before you understand why they put this movie up,1
he gets a ride back from the rko and they make themselves at home in the mountains to escape this cold and dark world while at the end he is able to get rid of a girl while he is at home,1
and with kubricks in the lead i was expecting a little more but the movie had enough of them,1
it 's your typical sitcom in that regard but the humor is more like what you 'd expect from late night television like a talk show skit or saturday night live back when snl was actually funny,0
so i 'd recommend it to a lot of people just for the antiwar story,0
i am glad to live in nineteen hundred because i have seen the beginning of the black and white television the movies and all the technology and special effects to be able to watch videos at home and to live in the same century as redford because i have had the chance to see his works,0
br br the second film is a sequel to the first one,1
anyway it was nasties day and they were in a bar near us,1
i think of sideways when i think of this movie but i think this is more watchable and a better movie overall,0
rich people like you are evil you need a government to save you,1
it 'll be a lot of pain to sit through,1
ed harvey 'donkey jacks'' is a funny but ultimately misguided comic and even more offensive,1
robert redford directs this film and tells the story of the maclean 's through the perspective of the older brother norman norman gets offered a position at the university of chicago at age 26 and marries the woman he will always be in love with what this film also points out is that the younger brother paul has attained an accomplishment of his own by being the epitome of a remarkable fly fisherman,0
what i can see this film got very little screen time and exposure so much more a loss for an equally traumatized americabr br ten out of ten,0
the other is the character 'emotions and thoughts of each person,1
the director of this film made a movie about love and sex,1
was little brother saved by his father,0
six years earlier the worked together on the trip to bountiful a film that seems almost actionpacked in comparison to this one,0
around this time there has been unusually heavy rainfall in australia,0
the original is still the best,0
his father've got to have done at a moment where cagney wants cagney to give up the idea in favor,1
in the real life of peter o 'donnell an american war veteran and a cop on the front line and after watson 'the black hole'' was shot the role of peter o paul thomas was a much more prominent one in my opinion,1
he acted well and adjusted to being the nice good looking young rich kid,0
to make things difficult however tristan 's fallen star is actually a woman named yvaine and he 's not the only one looking for her some witches have their greedy eyes on the immortality the star 's heart can give and a brother 's feud over the magic kingdom leads murderous princes in her directionbr br from there it 's all pretty predictable but it involves some attractive fantasy elements some warmhearted commentary on the nature of love and the best part robert deniro as a gay pirate,0
the score to this film is also something to be mentioned as it is epic and grand and beautiful to listen to whether it 's the actual score or the christmas music everything fits together,0
it'ss not scary either it'ss not so bad,1
makes me wonder if the man wanted to make himself into something even more frighteningbr br this is a great example to watch if you get what i was talking about but if there're any other better films that i would recommend i highly advise it,1
yet this fastpaced and tightlyplotted film is far from being a dreary morality talebr br in the 30s hollywood had a knack for churning out one entertaining and enlightening audiencepleaser after another all without wasting a frame of film,0
he does it to himself,1
a critical and financial flop when first release the critics have turned around and stated that this film ison of the director 's best,0
possible spoilers br br i like this film and have no problem staying awake for it,0
please remember that when you need something to be scared it wo,1
stewart yet again puts a new look on the everpresent personalities he had in the five stewartmann westerns,0
ben gazzara was an excellent cast and easy to fall in love with,0
and what about the head,0
might make you feel different,0
her character is the meaning of emotionally disturbed,0
some of it is a bit more serious though so you might get a little annoyed,1
going into seeing this movie i was a bit skeptical because fantasy movies are not always my cup of tea,0
the way they tried and failed to get there just wasnt believable,1
aunt samantha is an aging doctor who believes that a woman could find the body of her former lover,1
br br the acting was superb and the story was marvelous,0
the actors in this movie have had no talent whatsoever,1
he brings very little to the story when he appears alone we wonder if we 've not missed a part before,0
the problem was that it was not very realistic to the point of overdoing things,1
they 're all to predictable and they tend to become boring and dull very fastbr br these series however are well played the story follows through all episodes and even if you miss one the story will still be catching your mindbr br the episodes are all filmed on a hospital and takes you further and further in to the mysteries of dark and old secrets that lies just beneath the surface of the mighty hospital,0

scott baio plays brad way before chachi on happy days,0
it 'll leave some viewers wondering where is the love and devotion of all these people when no one is around to help,1

a few years ago a friend got from one of his other friends a video with the michael mann film 'heat' on it,0
the idea that the writers should take such an unlikely cast with two good actors and a script with so much potential that they ca nak it at the boxoffice might have worked a long way in the long running as the script was never really up for debate,1

vincent cassel plays paul as a cornered dog who only really seems at home when he 's receiving a beating or concocting the ripoff that is likely to get him killedbr br like many french films 'read my lips' appears at first to be about nothing in particular until you scratch beneath the surface and find that it 's probably about everything,0
if you 'd seen riget you can see this one without being disappointed,0
an element that is different between the two directors is that villaronga favours a supernatural undertone spliced with claustrophobic gritty realism opposed to almodovar 's use of surrealism although both styles are similarbr br the piece gives an insight into troubled young psyche and contains disturbing violence and scenes of a sexual nature,0
worth watching just to see the movie with the actors,1
this film version portrays all of that quite beautifully,0
but it 's also related to the case david is defending,0
maybe it sometimes is too much but the overall result is so beautiful that i am not going to be critical about that,0

the two are about as realistic and credible as a japan dog would put upbr br overall i've lost count,1
the acting is terrible with the only thing being a really crappy and stupid cameo from the usual suspects,1
watch this movie again,1
when it seems that she've had to make the switch to an unhermed life the realisation of that is very moving,1
even if you ca n't track down the video the soundtrack is worth it too,0
yes you got that right about the first 40 or 60 minutes but overall this is pretty good,1
the music was great and the film is well paced even though it could have been one of the better movies that i have seen that year,1
when it comes to music the director never seems to show much interest or interest in the songs he is giving away,1
although the movie itself is pretty good the movie lacks much of substance it can be enjoyable to sit down and watch a film by yourself with some friends,1
br br as a result of the movie'scandalous behavior and the need to make movies we are all constantly disappointed in the first 10 to 15 min,1
therefore i was very pleased with the decision by the producers and director to have rachel portray lucy in rehearsal for the most memorable of these skits vitameatavegamin and the candy factory,0
richard benjamin shines as matthau 's nephew and agent,0

what a delightful movie,0

after all the other characters are the hero 'heroine'of course,1
but sadly i have to report that there are some flaws,0
do not expect to walk out of an interview,1
if you enjoyed her deliciously btchy performance in the recent hairspray then you will thoroughly enjoy her in this toobr br so to round off this review you will laugh for sure you will smile and you may even cry stardust is a beautiful heartwarming fairytale for all the family with a heart of gold and more sass 'n smarts than is immediately apparent,0
the plot was nigh on ridiculous,1
if you have naught of film noir in a genre with such good actors you better hope it 'nt be on tv,1

redford shows the hands of the creator so magnificently and a river runs through it,0
and by extension the life of its main character soll br br this is the first collaboration of director peter masterson and writer horton foote,0
the acting is uniformly horrible although many of katharine hepman and her character are rather good here and even more so with a beautiful nude body,1
there is nary a word that could be said to indicate that the director is either a little off or is trying too much to cashin on a certain genre of filmmaking,1
not only does he have no personality at home but he has nothing to do except to watch people talk to him on the phone,1
jane fonda was unable to hide her braininess enough to make her character believable,0
georges julieson had to leave the studio to direct the second half and i felt that the two films could have been better if not for the actors there're too much to be said,1
most often he is played as a jolly santa type character,0
who the hell said that theatre stopped at the orchestra pitor even at the theatre door,0
the good thing is this music will grow on people with time like it did with me after the i watched that movie a second time,0
brillius and cid appear as the only members who can explain how they happened to escape from an army unit,1
so the film is a comedy,1
to me this was one of the most touching moments in all the movie'revery,1
this was a huge mistake on my mind and it've definitely gotten better over the yearsbr br the plot is simple,1
and it'spares me the grief of not having watched it but i will give the movie 2 stars if you like this movie and i do so with a heavy pinch,1
grim but intriguing and frightening,0

brian keith plays davy crockett here and gives a fine interpretation of the rollicking frontier character he wasbr br it 's a lot closer to professor lon tinkle 's book on the alamo than the wayne film was and having read the book years ago i can attest to that,0
it 's got action drama romance great battles fantastic acting amazing fight scenes and awesome music by john williams,0
david niven was number 36 on the 50 greatest british actors the film was number 86 on the 100 greatest tearjerkers for the happy ending it was number 47 on the 100 greatest war films it was number 46 on the 50 greatest british films and it was number 59 on the 100 greatest films,0
even for the lowbudget lowbudget crap this is still an entertaining movie and has good laughs the jokes sometimes become irritating in later attempts at humorbr bernadini does nazarin've the look but he does n've the chops for this role and makes for a credible screen presence,1
as many good films i noticed my opinion of it improved after a second viewing,0
clearly it was an attempt by some indian director who was not interested and a bad film in and of course it does take place right after khan 'eshebaheba is set,1
read my lips is a nifty twisty contemporary tale of office politics that unexpectedly becomes a crime caper as the unusually matched characters slide up and down an ethical and sensual slippery slopebr br the two leads are magnetic emmanuelle devos and an even more disheveled than usual vincent cassel br br the first half of the movie is on her turf in a competitive real estate office and he 's the neophyte,0

the only bad cast member was the actress who played anne marie,0
convicts is very much a third act sort of film,0
just when people think about what a great actor he is he is not as good,1
susannah york and the other actors do a fine job of bringing the characters to life,0
even the music was okay but just seemed to be lost in the script,1
it 's also nice to see a nonhuman playing a role and the decision to give the captain a dog named 'porthos' was a wellreceived idea,0
and so after a chance meeting at a bar with danny he latches on and begins a halting awkward friendship,0
smithson'rejected a script by richard gwynner as a good deal more of a comedy version then a drama one that deals with the subject matter in depth,1
i gave this movie a seven casting aside the fiction historical errors,0
dvd brings the movie to life again and i saw it differentlybr br anyway seeing it as if for the first time i realized that the treatment of magic is extremely good in this movie,0

i also remember winning wonderful cars if the contestant got the final hidden picture game,0
maybe something with a little more electronic sound would suffice,0
tommy leung is a very nice and likically played character with good eye candy,1
case in point the whole movie is about karen,1
i think it was a real believable movie that i would see again and recommend,0
the acting is really terrible as well with the script the editing terrible and the script so bad i am left scratching my head as to what should have been an enjoyable piece of entertainment to begin with in the first place,1

indonesia is on board with the idea of a movie that does not have any real content but at least has some entertainment valuebray is the worst of all the film is set as a kind and innocent drama set around a young woman that finds a woman killed in a car accidentbr br its not even remotely sexy,1
sure it was n'reary in that it 'edgy kind'and some of the humor was quite tame but the movie had all this fun of the classic rock star,1
to add to that even when they get their head screwed up at the end of the film they are still not sure how they should die,1
and it actually is a movie you can watch together as it wo n't drive adults up the wall,0
marilyn manson on the soundtrack and david boreanaz denise richards and katherine heigl as eye candygo with the flow and enjoy it,0
once there they have to contend with seductive shifty businesswoman ruth roman and icecold happygolucky villain james mcintirebr br john wayne may get talked about more but his good pal stewart made some excellent hardedged westerns too some with the great director anthony mann,0
um not at the expense of the whole film,1
this is probably not a good film to sit through if you aren't used to seeing people kill people,1
if you have an open mind there is a fine script,1
the movie was a little dull in parts and i'm not going to get in too deep with the plotbr br this film is really about two young people one of the two young men,1
the viewer is intrigued by these questions and the actors unravel the answers slowly and convincingly as they face events that challenge and shape their feeling towards each otherbr br once you have seen this film like me you may want to see it again,0
on a lighter note this is one to avoid,1
it may have been the first time in film history that a director had to write a film so obviously not intended for children,1
that're the same guy who gave this one a 10 rating,1
br br filmed just after the war this story was made in order to highlight angloamerican relations after the war,0
colette is a woman who has a secret that no women want to be associated,1
however the script and the direction in this film are really just bad,1
encore,0
there are basically two kinds of movies i like movies with depth and mindless comedies where i can sit back and relax,0
like all of the mannstewarts this is a traditional western with a difference in the elaboration of stewart 's character which is more complex,0
it seems like everyone in this movie branched out from their previous work to such a degree that it actually improved the comedy,0
2 when luke sees the spirits of obiwan and yoda and then it shows up anakin skywalker 3 when leia slays jabba strangling the hutt crime lordbr br i personally like the script and the battle of endor presenting a ground and space combat as well the best duel of star wars between darth vader vs luke skywalker on the death star,0
on the one hand it is not really a story and certainly not a plot,1
it was hard watching it because the characters just appeared and vanished into the background,1
it is just too damn awful and that is saying a lot,1
wow,1
an axellent second installment that manages to be just as good as the first,0
like the first scene in the film michael is talking about why he was hired in the film in the morning and his brother isn't even in the film,1
an absolute must see,1
there are so few movies in which actors are so good and talented that you wonder if they are actually acting and directing,1
the film is an excellent example of how not to build good films the story is well told and if you read into any character names you 'get itbr br it is the story of a young man who must go on a hunger strike against a repressive police department that targets him for his beliefs,1
and of these two stars jane zellah has the most to dobr br in that sense this is a film that hasn't been missed at a couple of festivals,1
the lighting the cinematography quality work,0
perry was quite successful with this film and for the time the first time anyone had an opportunity to portray a character who had gone through something similar to his life as his partner alexis 'burger and his girlfriend the rest were either flat out laughable,1
why does every member of that crew always act like it 'll get better from now until there is no more time for anything else,1
tonight it'stays that way for most a la de sade movies,1
it 's all about mitzi,0
maybe i shouldn't have bothered making this movie,1
the music is great,1
during the the two part intense battle a third battle must take place as luke willingly delivers himself to vader in an attempt to convince him to leave the dark side,0
but this is not one,1
very good for a lowbudget film,1
even though the film is a little slow at times and occasionally i found myself asking the bad guy what it is he thinks of him and this was a good way to show that,1
no,1
eat your heart and go,1
it does n't pander for tears or ask for sympathy,0
well i do n't see why it 's snobbish to condemn blues music and that 's not what powell and pressburger are doing anyway,0
it 's so strange to see a sweet cupid face doing all of these horrible things,0
i wanted to see valentine ever since i saw that denise richards and marley shelton were in it because they had played in some of my favorite movies ever,0
the humor is always mediumgauge never unfunny but never gutbusting,0
as a child myself i always had a fond affection towards robert roman as a villain in 'the last of the jane eyres ',1
which of course meant that perhaps just perhaps it was n't meant for respectable folk and that the only residents should be the amoral and the shifty those who dispensed justice strictly from the barrel of their revolvers and where kill or be killed would ever be the law of the land,0
and who cares if it 'does get funny and a bit repetitivebrats if you really want to see some laughs and an enjoyable story then watch it and enjoy it for what,1
seems like the only reason this movie has survived was because of the ridiculous script and the scriptwriters,1
it seems that his aunt and uncle have lost their own son so uncle jed seems has lost his zest for living,0
this is not about things and people that have gone bad,0
but there was nothing left to say in his face about it,1
as burton 's investigation continues his clients make his work difficult by refusing to disclose the true events surrounding the murderbr br after chris starts to appear in his dreams burton is convinced that the aborigine was killed in a tribal ritual because he saw too much though chris refuses to acknowledge this in court,0
of course greg kinnear is always great,0
lando is hidden as jabba 's guard and chewbacca is also gave to jabba by a reward hunter,0
i have to say i so did not care by that pointbr br really the only reason i can recommend this is that orlando bloom kind of sort of shows some hints of range so fangirls may find it worth the matinee price,0
ok,1
same story line young guy falls for older women older women falls for young guy to,0
the only positive part to this movie is the music and the action but not enough to save it from being badbr dvd'spoiler alert,1
that indecipherable quality tantalizes me into watching it again and again,0
like this movie was made and done i'm sure it was not meant as a comedy about a man fighting against a lot like the original,1
the film is slow slow and is nary interesting,1
paul sleeps in the office carla helps him carla looses a contract to a rival coworker paul helps her carla 's ability to read people 's lips comes in handy for a makeshift idea for paul,0
910,0
but then there are some moments that come at you from the audience when you want something extra to think about,1
most of the acting in the film is very good and everyone plays his role very realistically,1
there is n't a lot of critical praise to give this film either you like it or you do n't,0
why you ask,1
he never made an impression on any character in the movie,1
so that he can avoid his partner 's fate he is visited by three spirits who show him visions of christmases past present and yet to come so that he will hopefully see the error of his ways before it is too late,0
some are just too weak to be funny,1
personnaly i never run over such a twistoff story in real life,0
three things i have noticed throughout much of wtc ii the first one is its pace,1
this film has nothing to do with its main subject that this is a documentary but does have something unique to say,1
this movie made me look at the world differently vicarious experience according to my english teacher,0
we could see his eyes and ears in a scene where he was about to go into an armrest and a scene with a girl walking in front of him in a park and then the girl was right behind him in the same scene the same way her eyes were in the same place with the same camera position,1
she gets her share of pie and seltzer in the face but learns her trade,0
i have only seen him in the remake of the long hot summer where he played a weak character,0
thanks to kevin smith a bunch of geeks are running around saying that return of the jedi is n't any good because it 's actually fun to watch,0
i had my moment of glorybr br this movie though now somewhat dated is a must see for ramones fans or anyone else for that matter,0
taking over roles that jack albertson and sam levene played on broadway walter matthau and george burns play a couple of old time vaudeville comics a team in the tradition of joe smith and charles dale who seem to have a differing outlook on lifebr br walter matthau ca n't stop working the man has never learned to relax take some time and smell the roses,0
the actors are all actors so well cast that they can act without getting their lines hurt,1
but her plan is ruined when a crazy killer dressed in a santa suit comes her waybr br if you look it up on youtube you can watch it for free but most of you have already seen this,0
i do n't know if the idea of this movie is love conquers all even social and moral standards or love is beautiful no matter how or where,0
to add insultto injury the film ends on the same note that the end of love at the same spot i'm sure noone has ever walked in that movie beforebr br the story has it'splattered by time inconsistencies and confusing characters that keep you going while i'm not quite sure whether it'setstleted a new standard or simply simply fell into a tired clich,1
thank you,1
what happens in here is this movie takes what it has seen and puts on a show to everyone,1
i do like the ramones and i suppose if you hate them then besides being a avid bush supporter you might not like this classicbr br it 's immensely better than the sappy john hughes teen films and the like that littered the 80 's,0
first of the main problem with watching a movie about a woman that is the equivalent of a lesbian is the presence in films about women about men,1
hide and snuff films of the early 90ies are just not for everyone,1
room with a view was also newly out,0
it has some interesting plot twists and surprises,1
6the dark side seduction scene,0
br br at the end of the film you never know what 'they were up for and there are a few twists along its path,1
flippen is a drunk at first but tragedy and responsibility shake him into a better frame of mind and one who has a chance to verbally stab stewart in the heart using stewart 's own words against him,0
a child poked and bullied at school who becomes a hero,0
i thought it kicked as,0
the music in this one is quite good and the soundtrack is not,1
cut away from that first part before the last,1
despite not being a real vampire it is not scary enough to make it a horror movie either but still there are scary scenes nonetheless,1
also known as stairway to heaven in the us,0
bottom line a christmas carol is a timeless story and this rendition is a timeless classic,0
and when you compare his work here with other characters he 's created from sid lidz in unstrung heroes' to pete in o brother where art thou',0
maybe i loved this movie so much in part because i 've been feeling down in the dumps and it 's such a lovely little fairytale,0
overall i think that the show is a must for every aspiring actors and directors,1
the character is a typical middleman type of guy the character acts as if it is normal for an everyday person,1
as usual when you have the budget it is rare to see a movie with such poor results that you expect them to be the first laugh,1
at one point mick the bartender actually kills the waiter and then leaves,1
the ending does nudge you toward the conclusion,1
this movie is very cool,0
the atmosphere is astounding,0
pretty sure it've all gone down the drain from all this bad trash already before but it're not as disappointing as some of the stuff that was made before,1
a man who finds those smaller than himself to be inferiorbr br we all know the story and the quotes,0
overall diane warren 's theme is beautifully orchestrated and is sung just as well by opera singer russell watsonbr br what makes any television show watchable and worth watching time and time again is its characters and the way they become structured and layered,0
his character was a bit too predictable for the audience to care what happened to himbrat one moment he appears on screen the victim who has been brutally sexually abused by a stranger at the beginning,1
what saves this are some truly funny lines and wonderful performances by soles and woronov,0
it was n't what i was expecting that 's for sure,0
bronson 'the new king of thieves is a great film,1
25 minutes of torture for the first half of the film,1
still in the end it just wasn't worth it,1
there were certain things about it that hit very close to home and opened up some old wounds that never quite healed,0
the movie was keep you guessing as which direction it 's going,0
the only way i know the real thing is if i see the guy in full beard and is looking at him to ask where he is,1
how could jim varke do it,1
like the other reviewers who mentioned the fact it is a film where everything works and the whole story is in the hands and the acting is a little on pace the acting is good but what can be said about it is that the first hour wasn't all that great eitherbr br the first half of half an hours feels a bit slow but the second half is more intense and interesting than it otherwise wouldbr br there 'll be no real surprises here but it 'll be a fun film to sit through,1
always a true piece of art,1
the scene in the movie where riker runs down the hall with a rifle and says i'm not going home anymore doesn't exactly make up for the lamely overused ending,1
enter paul a recent released excon parolee who responds to an ad to be carla 's assistant,0
they leave the office and have lunch at a local eatery where carla interviews her prospective assistant,0
it 's a grand and bold experiment in improvised recursive filmmaking,0
it 's absolutely perfect as it is,0
i remember distinctly when hollywood came to lexington ky where we were living at the time to make april love,0
the film is slow moving and feels like an extended shot of people walking out on the big screen,1
br br,1
the movie has a very good story too,1
he is a perfect foil for relaxed style of niven and his virtual overstatement contrasts so nicely with the seriousness of the rest of the characters,0
marion davies stars in this remarkable comedy show people released by mgm in 1928 davies plays a hick from savannah georgia who arrives in hollywood with her father,0
much like the first film they make a point of not having any actors of either sex but rather only actresses,1
it 'll take you five years but you 'll be able to make it back with it,1
alice has a good time at school and plays it straight,1
james earl jones and mel winkler both but in great performances as well as hassbr br this movie should have gotten more notoriety,0
trust us you 'll love it the ending was too good not to like,1
the movie is actually quite interesting and interesting,1
other than that nothing to write home about,1
there'seems like a lot more money but also more money,1
br br in case you do n't want to read further down the page i 'll sum it up here it 's more mature than ella enchanted but does n't try to be overly corny or overstep its bounds,0
in return of the jedi the epilogue of the first trilogy is over and the empire finally falls,0
and then he just starts playing the part of a child,1
sorry but nobr br the direction is very good managing to show very little actual gore and relying on your imaginations implied threat,0
the scenery is worth seeing alone and actually helps relieve tension,0
i must admit that i had my doubts about this movie before i was going to watch it,0
fastforward half an hour and we are treated to the following story line which isn't nearly as good if not better in my opinion,1
mostly it're because of a combination of bad acting bad writing and a great story that is so bad that at times i could nabbling with laughter but it was so bad that it actually made me want it to endbr ronald depp stars as a man with a family,1
lack of nurturing combined with an inability to negotiate even the simplest necessities of daily life or the basic social requirements may compel even a genius to enthusiastically embrace that which provides a personal comfort zone,0
from the sound track to cinematographic effects and dialogue that speak volumes it'ss not really a bad film,1
the ending was predictable and the ending was even more predictablebr br the only reason to rent this movie or watch it again would have you feel cheated,1
baio 's skateboarding through a pack of goons and outrunning them was meant to show us that the troubled times will pass and we are meant to get through them to better timesbr br the whole metaphor of moving on and the procession of life is present throughout the film and serves to give us hope in the endbr br i like this movie though i do not watch it often as it tends to make me melancholybr br it should n't be viewed by young children and probably only those raised in the 1970 's80 's would want tobr br it rates a 7410 from br br the fiend,0
br br sadly the story wears thin after a while,0
told completely without dialogue it is a visual treat about a young boy who buys a gold fish lovingly places him in a bowl then goes off to school leaving the gold fish unprotected and a window carelessly open,0
art immitating life,0
many people believe it is a story of two men one with a sense that he will never win the respect of his friends and his own family,1
it is a must see for anyone who likes a fun laugh or someone whose favorite character is the lead characterbr,1
this sequel was made in 1987 and was supposed brittish,1
cheers,1
the only good part of this movie is the ending,1
go see it,1
the cast was excellent the plot was suspenseful and entertaining and it was just an overall enjoyable movie,0
nastasya is vacationing in a marble columned resort where a chess championship is being hosted,0
kudos to everyone involved with this film,0
while this has the advantage that it shows what could have been a very low brow tone of the story we are never actually allowed a single bit or sense of humor to really sink our jaws like it did herebr br and that is in a sort a way,1
he 'll be fine if they take her back to the hotel where she lives and find her out where she got hold of the necklace,1
so i think it would have been good if the series had focused on some of these people but alas it has nadir and isn't so exciting,1
who knows,0
these evil people capture the yokai and throw them into a red pit along with unwanted objects like motorbikes and other mechanical things and these meld into one horribly violent robotic monsters whose only job is to kill,0
oh yeah i saw this in the summertime when my friends were kids i had watched it over and again,1
but i kept waiting for the punch and it never came,0
the fact has it is a very talented group of directors and writers,1
this is undoubtedly a film that stays with you,0
it would only work on a single set which would require a dedicated video camera to take pictures and keep it moving,1
so what exactly is wrong with this picturebr br first you have to admit as a fan that when i saw these movies with a friend we couldn't care one little or the other how these guys lived their life because the majority never got to be a complete piece,1
i was also very impressed with hope davis 's performance,0
at this point in the show'storytelling wasn't needed at allbr br the story of the dukes of hazzards was made into an interesting story to develop an engaging story about the relationship between the women and the men in that story the relationship between dr mcconaugther sutherland '70 '81 and the directorbradley mazzellobradleys of the 50'' s who came out that was the first series produced by the bbc tv show,1
jodie foster is really cute and is amazing as always she was extremely likable caring had a lovable character was intense in some scenes was focused and she and cherie currie were the heart of the film as jeanie and annie,0
but will they get there,0
this dvd version features yet more tweakingwe get to see more montage finale scenes and in what is probably the most controversial change hayden christensen as the specter of anakin skywalker in the closing scenes,0
tess is definitely a gifted filmmaker,0
by coincidence the main character get involved in bombing and terrorism by a group called 'werewolves' they put pressure on him to help them placing bombs on trains,0
people have a lot of issues with this movie but are not able to deal with them,1
i think this movie is destined to be a fantasyfairytale classic,0
the film ends with a gun battle and as rodney lies dying bonnie tearfully phones in her storybr br this is a super film with crawford and gable giving it their all,0
every single line of dialog just makes no sense whatsoever in the movie,1
with the cast they were very good with each one giving an interesting performance,1
it contains very graphic scenes and images,0
oh man why ca n't we have stuff like this coming out of hollywood,0
it culminates into an ultimate revolt between the obsolete funhating adults and the teenagers,0
br br paul has a difficult transition returning to the world outside of prison walls and finds himself in another sort of prison one of the office variety and another of indentured servitude to pay off an old debt,0
not a minute of that time was wasted the mother and the whore is truly beautiful work one of the best of french relationship dramas maybe even just one of the most staggeringly lucid i 've seen from the country in general,0
br br like i said this film does n't take itself that seriously and is n't pretentious like so much other teen fare of the seventies eighties and nineties,0
people would be more entertained if i've made a movie like this all the time just to see it in all its glory,1
that've got to be my favorite lines from this film and they are so funny the whole time,1
and that makes it so great,0
for instance the movie has a little too many people in a film and there is no suspense,1
after seeing the film for my first time after seeing the english version this was a must see,1
continuity is nosedived into the usual stuff,1
gorgeous scenery,0
ok so this is coming a few weeks late but it is here,0
it is a moving performance and one of the movie 's most dramatic scenesbr br even more magnificent is the performance given by the wonderful english actor frank finlay as scrooge 's late partner jacob marley,0
is it already,0
spoiler alert,0
first of all riget is wonderful,0
this is a film about the power that man is in his ability as the power that we all have to overcome in order to make it to the summit,1
boy is this one bad,1
the acting is superb,0
the acting is a joy to watch in itself,0
he is the embodiment of bad,1
the first thing that kept her from giving in were their characters,1
the film does have some good moments like the ending where the baddie is about to die he makes a great escape,1
before i get to the movie let 'es say that i have very limited experience dealing drugs and this movie was just that,1
their acting styles were so similar that i found the result boring unenergetic and disappointing,0
it was pretty enjoyable and i'm glad to have it in my collection,0
this movie draws you in and gets you hooked on keeping your eyes on the screen,0
even if this is an attempt at showing the world how stupid and stupid people really can get their heads hurt,1
whether it be celie having lived through hell and losing her sister and shug coming into her life to show her love again albert not being man righting his wrong toward celie shug shunned by her father and confesses to him in the end sofia and her stubborness good and bad and even nettie they had their emptiness and hardship through the film but was overcome in the end and that 's the sign of a good movie,0
maybe this was a poor excuse for a movie,1
my dad had been in numerous plays and was a talented man,0
for that matter he has a cameo with laura leigh of the britany hills project but even that is a very minor part of his character,1
if they can make this funny then i am sure he is a great director but as an actor he is in his prime,1
produced on a shoelace for a couple thousand to a million the film is very funny and i thought it was hilariousbr the lead actor was very funny and the script was full on humor,1
he really poured his whole being into this role,0
we can never be sure of the truth of the matter but the filmmakers were right that the whole story just happened,1
in the process her face has morphed into an animal,1
the villains were led by charles bickford and porter hall as jack mccall br br basically the film takes up the history of the us after the civil war,0
i find it hard to watch number 1 because of how he kills the first girl its disturbing,0
star trek is back voyager nobody misses you,0
was the cast so bad that it needed no extra effort to make up for it,1
i also appreciated the victory celebration where it fulfills vader 's redemption and returns hi into anakin skywalker spirit along with yoda and obiwan,0
but what can i expect,1
and why not,1
if ever there is a movie that i've hated for so long i 'll say to myself oh crap,1
so much back story and founding of the federation left to tell including the onset of hostilities with the klingons,0
but this is really a movie to watch if only just to see how a bad actor was born to play a bad actor,1
teeth that are a lot harder to kill are just as easy to stomach,1
aghhh,0
even worse that one of his best performances was given to a cast of people who would have been worse than in the film,1
it 'll be a good film for most people who like james woods and the fact that he was a good actor in the original tv series,1
this is the best series of its type i 've seen all year,0
if you 'll forgive me i 'll say that it was not worth the film for me because this is the worst of the worst and not funny,1
the only thing this movie has in common with the other two is it is set on a desert planet,1
moreover the plot is a bit more complicated than kubrick had envisioned and there are some very weird moments like when kubrick finds out all about the woman and the time she has been in jail,1
the story is so well thought out and well crafted that is what makes it such a pleasure,1
we all have to face our own insomnia someday,0
this may not have been the worst movie i've watched but i wish i would have rated it higher,1
the lodger and hangover square,0
the film has a beautiful black landscape but it feels like it was cut out of a film,1
rogers was one of the best documentaries and a true legend in hong kongs cinema,1
my wife and i laughed all throughout,1
immensely atmospheric film filled this one with a sense of awe and amazement,1
this is really the first of overlooked films from his career that you cannot make these observations,0
finally benita ha is the luckiest one since she was not a classmate of the serial killer david boreanazbr br the third and the last iconic element is the soundtrack from the blind date labyrinth scene the valentines' day celebration at dorothy 's house scenes and ultimately the killing themes,0
this film accompanied by i am curious blue is a masterworkbr br the only thing that will let you down in this film is if you do n't like the process of film do n't like psychology or if you were expecting hardcore pornographic rammingbr br this is n't a film that you will want to watch to unwind it 's a film that you want to see like any other masterpiece with time attention and carebr br summaries may contain a spoiler or twobr br the main thing about this film is that it blends the whole film within a film thing but it does it in such a way that sometimes you forget that the fictions are n't realbr br the film is like many films in onebr br 1,0
but unlike yes by sally potter which i had seen some days before where after leaving the cinema i felt a strong desire of wishing to embrace the whole world and was just happy to be alive this time quite the opposite thing happened there was something that dragged me down and the air suddenly felt cold and hard to breathe,0
no movie is flawless but a hollywood version could n't do the story better,0
but the movie itself feels like a piece of junk it seems that it was made and is no longer that great a piece in it,1
and i do like it,0
the film is made up on a shoestring basis and the actors look good,1
there is so little i do of any interest in this film that i wo t care whether it remains in my mind for days in it 'll just keep popping back to me at some pointbr,1
but spielberg would eventully go on to win two oscars years later for schindler 's list and saving private ryan making him one of the best movie directors of alltime,0
but they are the annoyances of a generation of moviegoers who 've had time to nitpick every single scene,0
oration is a good movie and a really good way of showing the power of love,1
pure abstraction is n't really my thing but i can take it in small doses and the supersaturated optically printed colors and psychedelic feel of this series of flowers rohrschach blots birds etc is pretty compelling and quite beautiful,0
the script must've worked on its own with some extra material being included as an extra,1
it 'll probably appeal to more people so they might be attracted to it,1
first jeff kills two of gannon 's best gunman,0
it had it 's great moments too but i did n't realize how sad it was,0
it 's very effective,0
hard core slasher movie of the 90 is no slasher movie,1
ivan has made no secret that he is a realist and has no qualms about showing that,1
the boys ponder what they will be when they grow up,0
he would make this movie seem realistic to a younger audience or for those of us not easily amused,1
that person was toni a vagabond girl who does not seem to have any roots just like herselfbr br but the film 's title is ghosts and ghosts appear and disappear as they wish there is no way to retain them ghosts also represent the hidden fantasies of people strange ideas that occupy your mind and are only perceived by yourself hiding away from all other people,0
yet the movie was very funny and very interesting,1
her screen presence is so electrifying you are bound to love her performance,0
paul appears uneasy in the office environment is it that he 's just not cut out for work,0
shame to be in a studio where everything is so bad,1
lucas' cgi enhancements to the film in 1997 actually worsened the overall effect of the sarlac making it look fake and overdonebr br the battle scene on tatooine is outstanding and is one of the more memorable of the saga,0
while it is hard to believe that this was the first film that got a major hartley award nomination it is one of few that do,1
i 'd give it a 7 because it 's got enough great ideas to overcome its boring moments,0
the acting of the young gus is also brilliant,1
ben is killed and jeff is severely wounded but that does n't save judge gannon from his just due,0
in my book it should have gotten the better luck next time award,0
in what could have been seen as a coup towards the sexual revolution jean eustache wrote and directed the mother and the whore as a poetic damning critique of those who ca n't seem to get enough love,0
nanavati knows how to tell a story both in writing and on screen,0
overall the film was just boring but in that sense the ending was the best that i have ever felt for a japanese movie,1
highly recommended,0
it is almost epiclike in look and scope and the fact that it did not garner a single academy award from 11 nominations is a travesty and an insultbr br whoopi goldberg is fabulous as the tortured celie an unattractive woman given away by her incestuous father to an abusive danny glover who she only knows as mister,0
this film is about a man who is sent to prison for killing his excon girlfriend and gets the girl 'cause that 'wasn't real,1

no the kids were not shown very much at all and that was n't necessarily a drawback to this movie because like i said this focused mainly just on lucy desi,0
what i love is this movie,1

it 'll do for you if you like good laughs,1
i feel this movie is an accurate representation of what might happen to a person if they are faced with extreme temptationsbr br most of the cast are newcomers to the industry,0
annoyingly the trial and execution of ned kelly is not even depicted here simply referred to in subtitles before the credits rollbr br that said aside from some shaky camerawork at times ned kelly manages to depict some exciting shootouts and it has a good beginning,0
the best in the book would be an extremely realistic one,1
contrary to the claim on the previous page of this site that mary is gay and that the director of the film actually intended to portray this fact it is quite an astonishing achievement,1
dangerously boring,1

i would just like to say that no matter how low budget the film is it needs to be shown throughout this world the point to these movies,0
either way the visuals are distinctly ahead of their time occasionally reminiscent of a 1980s music video and some brisk techno music would n't have gone amiss either,0

at one point on an island that is owned in part by alain carroll the young man dies while on his way into town and the local sheriff thinks he is the killer and hires the sheriff to hunt down carroll and retrieve him,1
to say about this film its definitely on the wrong track of not just quality in a bad film,1
these were the kind of movies that could be made in the future,1

it 's unlikely that the director and producer drummed up much government support and funding for their film and they did the best they could with their likely limited resources,0

so if you are not used to express thing in a symbolic way you will find it strange if you are not acquainted with philosophy religion spiritual life you will think it 's just a fairytale and even a weird one chaotic,0
plus i usually do n't cry over movies but this one made me cry each time,0
i absolutely love the photography,0
mayble little bit stupid maybe not,0

just a warning before reading my other reviews,1
to a serious drama like the color purple was remarkablebr br,0
that was enough to turn me on to the moviebrilliantbr br all i have left the movie the best thing about it was the way the movie ended,1

so luzhin is a genius with an achilles heel a flaw which perhaps only one other person knows about and understands and furthermore realizes can be exploited for his own personal gain at this very tournament,0
even worse than that they took some of jodie '70 years old brian dante '71 '80 '85 film actors and actresses from the 90'sevential years old and older and made them all into something of a joke that really got old fast because it just was so lamely done that it made it laughable by the time it're over,1

in reality these functioned to made it the hallmark that it is in australian history,0
mainly a bad joke with good actors the special effects are worse,1
how can i make any sense out of this nonsensebr br the actors and actresses are simply not given enough time to develop as charactersbr br the story is too predictable and the characters too much likeable,1
i get bored of remade repetitive story lines and films with more flash than filling faster than you can count to 10 and this film is the diamond in the roughbr br by the end here i was tired enough of fractured expectations from the big hits that i averted seeing bourne ultimatum in favor of stardust,0

the acting is stunningly wonderful,0
it 's still a very good film even if a lot of its quality depends on the characters that have been built up in the superior 2 installmentsbr br one problem here is the look of the film which is n't very consistent with the other 2 films,0
although a somewhat enjoyable experience this is another movie that'should take the viewer on a tearbr br as usual it is not meant for children but for anyone who loved all three of the children'films,1

perhaps this is where mankind with all his technology is eventually heading towards an irreversible merging of film and video of purity and artificiality,0
i had not forgotten however the opening scenes which are among the most romantic ever filmedbr br anyone interested in politics or history will love the movie 's offhand references anyone interested in romance will be moved by hunterniven and anyone who loves visual imagery will enjoy the depiction of the afterworldbr br my favorite movie remains odd man out made near the same time but this one is superb,0
father has always taken his boys to reflect by the side of the river and contemplate god 's eternal words,0
except we are left with a small amount of gore and nudity because it was made for television,0
more spirits more bizarre occurrences more subplots,0
of course accidents happen all the time but i hoped to see the heroine get happily married with the first man she got involved with br br maybe the movie producers are aware of the fact that many romance between an older woman and a younger man do not last for long,0
something went on a lot from the beginning,1
but there're some real gems here,1
it does n've some of that gritty gritty look to a lowbudget film but it fails horribly here at least for the first halfbrad dourde and catherine firth are both underused here as usual and william powis was just not at their best,1
there are not many movies around that have given me a feeling like stardust did all throughout the course of the film,0
some might call it the greatest movie of alltime if only he had been the same age,1

the chameleon like vincent cassel is also wonderful,0
character development is all well and amped at the beginning but as we soon see that kane and peter are going through all the same problems in the film the film begins as if nothing has changed,1
yes but to make you think that this was a bad attempt made by the film'screw up now'for those of you who liked it do the next best thing do your best,1

end of plot not bad but not a total waste of timebrutal violence,1
its truly saying somethingbr br the film 's climax is of a sort that wants to partially be a thriller with twists,0

nick has still got it in terms of being able to demonstrate both charm and psychosis,0
the story wasn't bad at all the acting good and the photography and music were good to begin with,1

the other one is a little girl,1
the characters are real and believable but just as believable in the movie where a person 'gets up out of nowhere by falling down and dies,1
so a lot of the movie is about the life and death and then the final shot with the woman being strangled and the rest of the scene is just a scene of people screaming for the dead man to be freed,1
the storyline does n't just introduce your average blackgloved sexually frustrated killer but blends good oldfashioned revenge motives with the macabre myth of the murderous red queen,0
in usa it was retitled zentropa so audiences would n't confuse it with agnieszka holland 's europa europa from 1990,0
scott 's scrooge much more of a believable miser than the more current version done by patrick stewart,0
this movie could be rated pg for some scenes as it 'll be hard if you do n 'get a grip because the plot has been covered a bit but it all works as one and the film stays interesting as a watch,1

streep 'the boy starts off as a somewhat normal family man who is in this movie as well and plays an incredibly nice guy,1
the movie is shot with a low budget and has some pretty awful acting,1
in as selfish greedy world my family and i can lose ourselves in the christmas carol starring george c scott,0
the main difference is the acting from the leads,1
when i saw this movie again years ago i was in a state of shock,1
of the movie the movie does not take itself too serious and i found it hard getting into the plot,1

he is conflicted,0
the idea of an orphanage having to be a slave farm was actually funny since the girls only live there until their own day in the school,1
it is as if the writerdirector was trying to tell us that in an age like those in the mid 1990'september 1991 and early 1990 they felt they needed to do something new with the film and they did but the result didn't come off like a successful new venture,1
br br the story is beautiful and relates much to the indian system of arranged marriage which i too would like to be a part of,0
making your own movie is an easy enough task so here we have it for this movie,1
the game demands you memorize your surroundings,0
quite frankly and with the exception of some nice moments one needs more than one view of the subject matter,1
all in all an interesting story because it is based on a true murder and you will want to read ann rule 's book to get the accurate details,0
it're all very welldone and the film is enjoyable to watch,1
you feel the connection,0
thomas wendell is a wellknown writer for some time and i thought he really did a superb jobbrandon de sade was superb on this movie he was perfect in portraying the same role but i think he should have gotten the best actor oliviana rosenbrady as a young virgin for some reason,1

this movie is one that you can laugh at and cry about in your spare moments,1
may contain spoilers,1
the production value is very low but what can you expect for a first real film from someone still in high school,0
something that never really happens until there 'll probably have to,1

td was not my favorite character of the movie just because of it,1
this movie really is a masterpiece i am glad i wasted some time watching it i am glad that i never paid a rental fee in which i did n 'pay all that money to see this movie,1
the movie is well made and the ending a little predictable,1
but if the filmmakers are going to be giving an accurate representation of americana 'they've got the right people and the right people don't have to be afraid to say a lot to be considered funnybr br at the end the film seems to be made in a very short time frame and seems like a long time after we have seen it,1
the music also is fantastic,1
not even his mother can keep a smile up,1
is nadja a typical young blonde,1
what 'll you say,1
but audiences prefer davies in more comic roles perhaps director king vidor is offering up a case for art imitating life,0

it isn't enough for one or the others to make it over,1
another thing that called my attention is the fact that in this movie dancers and musicians dance and music are equally important the camera shows various aspects of music interpretation examining not only technical issues but also the emotional experience of playing,0
i know it 's not the same as real actors but in principle i believe it could work only this way it 's possible to make actors alive again,0
my only problem with this film the plot is stupid the dialog the action the direction is really hard the directing really bad,1

the whole point of this movie is that it makes a comparison to war and terror and does nneday the most pointless thing there can,1
one thing is clear in the last section that you have a film which is so full on the mind games between the characters you will enjoy it as much as one would do watching some really crappy crap like the american gangster,1
during the last few scenes i think that they should have used a longer story but they didn't at allbritt did a very well and interesting work and i think that he deserves a lot more screen play and screen adaptations,1

the final scene is one of the most harrowing scenes ever,0
the aborigines are invested with the kind of spiritual power that americans bestow on american indians whereas the fact is that mythology is mythology and while one may be more complex or satisfying more elegant and beautiful if you like mythology is still an attempt to transcend an ordinary demanding and sometimes disappointing physical existence,0
the background story is less important,0
yeah i know but it was supposed to add a bit of lightheartedness to it with the exception that it 'll only be a few minutes long though,1
at least she gets to sing along with josh brolin and is very happy about it especially because it is the only film she ever had the opportunity to see once,1
shot on film this is the one that should never be mistaken for a comedy,1
hard to imagine a director so focused on the acting and the editing of those two pieces of film,1
yet we were all glued back to our seats by its distinct opening which lacked creditsbr br some two hours later i just sat there wondering how could i not have heard of this masterpiece before,0
br br this movie really sucks,1
europa' is one of the most visually stunning films i have ever seen,0
my final rating 910,0
where i am amazed it 's to see that the character of the probation officer has not been erased,0
now when a movie has some truly good plot holes i just sit back,1
all the scenes are shot directly from the main movie,1
but have these been strengthened enough,0
it was out of place a good science fiction show should be able to stand on its own without trying to pad the preteen audience with some skin,0
br br this movie is not a film to waste,1
it seems at times it''es all just another piece of junk that the movie makers have spent their valuable time and are now going to try to sell,1
much of the dialogue could have used a rerun,1
the acting is horrible in particular is hamming up the acting,1

his performance is superb,1
i 've probably already killed at least ten hours watching this film,0
the cast was perfect br br if you haven't watched this movie yet and if only to see some of the scenes that took place at a theater i highly recommend it to anyone who likes to look at an excellent movie and is just as interested and doesn't look back,1
while the idea of fly fishing may seem an odd device to center a story it is not so implausible in redford 's directorial hands,0
some parts are a pit poor that needed polishing the acting and a bit more action,0
the final consequence is a point of view over luzhin which dignifies him more than the nabokov 's onebr br the only thing in the movie which i do n't like is the influence of valentinov 's on luzhin 's destiny,0
well done,1

the acting was all horrible from john cusack to samantha arquettes,1
and the film'spoilers to die hardbrittany price and bryan mendez are two of my favorite horror movie stars and their character performances are a must see for any fan to enjoy,1
after the war there were times of hardshipbr br so you wo n't find a war story in this film or at least not the kind of war story you expect,0
just like in the original the plot is pretty straightforward and the characters are welldeveloped and believable,1
i recommend this series to anyone who likes realistic sf anime or to those who think anime is just silly or sexy entertainment,0
yet it is the characters that we are treated to which is so much more exciting than the plot itself or any of this movie 'esquire of the real meredity and beauty and grace of this man and of my great love in the flesh and my whole life,1
i never did get who he was or what his issues were,0

following on from the conclusion of the empire strikes back luke skywalker follows his rebel alliance friends to tatooine his home planet to rescue han solo the space pirate turned rebel hero who was captured by jabba the hutt for overdue debtsbr br skywalker is a changed man since leaving tatooine with ben 'obi wan' kenobi to fight the evil empire,0
it just seems to have a certain feeling a little bit like the late 50 'ish and you realize later that it're supposed to represent something far more than this thing,1
it also made me wonder if the producers had anything to say to the audience during this interviewbr br while there were some interesting moments this was a horrible movie that was so predictable you had to wonder if you were actually going down in history as some were after this,1
the acting was terrible the story isn't,1
i'm looking for a patron anyone interested,0
many people that hated it called it to paraphrase 'beautiful but shallow' some even going so far as to say that norm 's desire yet inability to help his brother was a mundane plot at bestbr br i 'd like to disagreebr br as a brother of a sibling who has a similar dysfunction i can relate,0
like a typical low budget zombie movie the gore sequences and gore do nega generation generationbrigitte is a good girl in front of a camera,1
the movie is not a film you watch once you have watched the series and you can only hope you enjoyed it the whole first five'seasons,1

i would recommend this game to all horror fans and is very gripping from start to finish,0
if you feel that you want more than just some cheesy teen porn this is the one,1
br br i say not to judge this by us standards because it 's full of ambiguities and the kinds of equivocations that japanese culture readily embraces and is not beholden to the blackhat whitehat moral constraints us kids' films are routinely subjected to,0
also everyone is full of energy and playing their roles way over the top,0
if you liked this movie you should watch prime,0

no it 'll get worse,1
as a viewer myself i was pleasantly shocked about the lack of swearing and vulgarities and that the film was actually quite funnybr br i was also very pleased that all the main actors acted great and there was much character development and good humour,1
the fighting movements of these actors were proficient in every way,0
the film begins very well with the action going up through the action scenes which is nice to see and there 'll be a couple of neat tricks up its sleeve here,1
and i feel the film adaptation of this story has a far better ending than what was presented in the original novel by neil gaiman,0
i mention this commercial because it was considered funny and i did n't hear any objections to it while i was there,0
later he jumps from the train and lies in the cool grass on a river bank,0
what do they know,1
emannuelle devos gives a truly stunning multifaceted performance at times devious and manipulative at other times open and vulnerable,0

i loved the new race they brought on screen the mon calomari the ewoks the sullesteian and many more most of my favorite scenes are in that film1when vader destroys the emperor and is fatally wounded,0
do n't know how this missed award nominations,0
how different is the present laud,0
but even so this is a delightfully entertaining giallo and one that i highly recommend to fans of the genre,0
however in light of the above the film is intentionally clichd implausible and ludicrous,0
the film was actually more of a musical than a film,1
throughout the show you might be led into a surrealist nightmare world where one character takes the girl to a haunted house and is tortured by a monster that is trying to devours her,1
here the film is set on a beautiful but deserted island that is haunted by a young woman and her dog,1
this film is a must for the genre,1
thank god we never get a bad laugh for this,1
what i was curious about was who the hell is rukulbran,1
some will always be classics but among them my favorite is this film,0
all in all i would highly recommend this film and i am somewhat baffled why it did n't do better in the cinemas,0
but gaiman 's story draws you in with its surface familiarity only to subvert it all into a sweetly original tale of a boy and his heart,0
the way she handles the situation was extremely well done,1
gary cooper plays wild bill and jean arthur plays calamity jane and charles bickford plays the bad guy who sells weapons to the indians and you can hardly recognize him,0

the film goes off without any sort,1
the plot follows that of the jacob of the world who is sent to investigate the death of his brother jake and is brought to a hospital where his condition seems worse than that in most of his filmsbrillant and wellmade the film does nve the best line of the bunch and it comes across well the entire way throughbrillantly written by the director of his own creation ross corman'seton hickok a former star of a string of movies with similar title the story does nad vraak 'do i get it from you,1

creature effects are excellent the sound effects in this film are just awesome,1
the moment poor mr goodrich hangs up the phone and says i feel safer already a monstertype goon named nico appears out of a secret panel in the room and chokes him unconscious,0

actually at one time von trier seemed antiwoman to me by making breaking the waves and dancer but now i know his male characters do n't fare well either,0
you can imagine the problembrilliance and sense of humor in his performance and the way that he delivers itbr br it 'll also make you laugh out loud at how pathetic the movie isbrillieu can act,1
as his investigation proceeds he learns not only things about his clients but about himself toobr br to reveal more would be to spoil one of the strangest movies i 've ever seen,0
desolate is one of roosevenson kruger comedies in which the title character is the protagonist trying to overcome social barriers on a long road ahead,1
these mostly silent vignettes were very important to the animated film in remaining faithful to the printed page as the henry feature was mostly done in a sort of 4 color 'mime'br br in the cartoon titled betty boop with henry the funniest living american we see what is basically being a one situational exercise being punctuated with the usual array of dave fleischer 's rapid fire machine gunlike gags,0
with a good cast in this case i can safely recommend this movie,1
very religious person she is a picture of the hypocritical society and religious of the time she dedicates its life the morality of the villa that was committed by xica that is a woman full of lusts that it faces the society of the time to preach and it helps the slaves of the area,0

maybe,0
location locations locations shooting locations costumes specialeffectsbrands have done this movie with no luck and now with some new technology in place the studio is finally letting go of the original script and start to bring back the actors,1
and if you 've ever seen walken in any of his villainous roles you know the ogre bit the dust hard at the end when walken got him into his trapbr br a fun film and a mustsee for anyone who enjoys the unique style of christopher walken,0
all over i 'd say effects are from ok to goodbr br the music is also quite good,0
horror fans will know what i mean,1
there is an excellent soundtrack and a wonderful castbrad pitt manages to make his point in the film and is effective as the character'mr stalin and the man for whom he was entrusted,1

with the exception that she had her share to chew onbrains not enough to have given it a two star,1
this film is a buried treasure,0
smiles and feelgood senses are guaranteed right from the first time we see them all together on the bridge of the starship enterprise nx01br br the ship itself the nx01 is somewhat questionable in design,0
even the smallest roles were played to perfection like fritz feld auditioning for the potato chips commercial,0
the only thing i liked about this movie was the ending,1
of course like many other people which bought this movie i saw matthew 's name and that made me get it,0
but the shooting is just the genesis the movie is not about the shootingbr br lying in bed in a hospital room is deanna cartwright,0
the way it starts with them at some place and gets very violent after about 40 minutes and ends with them at a place in a room with a fire to get the people out,1
also starring jason connery,0
ungrateful and heart warming as the story unfolds,1
not one of the most dramatic films ever made but still not bad enough to stand on its ownbrilliant,1
proving that even what was once thought of as kinda cheesy can be really cool placed correctlybr br i was making my first feature when this came out,0

fotp is not a kiddiecartoon it includes some crude adult humor but in a very mild way,0
and most metaphysically affecting of all an anesthetic shot of train tracks as max von sydow 's voice allures us to hark back to europe with him and abandon our personal restraint,0
the main reason you should not watch this movie the fact is that there is nothing new in it,1
br br richard shephard the director of the matador presents us with a character julian noble who shows no redeemable qualities,0
but it does make sense,1
it'seems the only reason i watched it is so many people do,1
my only problem is the soundtrack,1
legend of zu cannot be a man called hero in my eyes but it flows like a videogame and that is not a bad thing at all,0
the film is an attempt at creating a 'love triangle between jessica smiths in the book and brian leigh in the film which fails miserably in the end,1
in that sense it is much the same appeal as midsomer murder or a miss marple mystery without the mayhembr br this is a great antidote to the mock horror currently popular in the usa an any relationships between people of different ages,0
however there is one point where the main character gets into fights with himself that you will never forgetbr br the rest of the movie also has scenes that i think were unnecessary as i did n've seen some of the other films that deal directly against the rules,1
psycho 's shower scene is tributed along with halloween 's masking,0
let me start by telling you why the story is nigh implausibly convolutedbr br first of the bad things,1

if ever anyone queries whether cinema is an art form you can do worse than pointing them at this moviebr br quite simply it is the perfect combination of story script actors and cinematography ever committed to celluloidbr br the story of a doomed bomber pilot who is missed by his heavenly conductor in the english fog during the second world war and his subsequent brushes with the celestial authorities is played with panache by david niven and kim hunter and is incredibly touching especially in the opening scenes when the doomed pilot describes his plight to the ground radio operator br br the sense of otherworldliness is heightened by jack cardiff 's photography and the incredible production designsbr br the supreme touches extend to the heaven shots appearing in black and white and earthbound scenes presented in technicolour this is even mentioned by the celestial conductor br br not only a highpoint in british cinema but a highpoint in cinema period,0
br br but when i saw this movie on tv as part of a commemorative jimmy stewart weekend upon his death i finally got it i understood at least in theory what the western mythos has to offer as a serious thematic preoccupation,0
thankfully the movie is not long long long and is really an interesting take on the buster kenneth branford films and is a pleasant change from some of the other recent offerings,1
beautiful movie,1
however this film is the biggest waste of a great piece,1
luzhin is a master of the game but he is vulnerable in that chess has long since ceased to be a game to him rather it is his obsession that one thing discovered in childhood that saw him though his total ineptness in seemingly all areas of life and enabled him to cope with the subtle disenfranchisements of his immediate family,0
in a lot of films where a couple do nudged in a couple films the actors are playing themselves instead of their characters,1
but a twist in the tale was necessary to transcend the movie from a beautiful premarital video to a 'feature film',0
and larry drake with his creepy hiccuping guffaw a demented twinkle in his bright green eyes and a leering truly wicked grin makes for a sensational sanguinary saint nick,0
the script is not as sharp as we've been warned,1
i could not imagine how screen comedy could be possible without relying heavily on spoken word or numerous pratfalls,0
directed by richard shepardbr br a well formulated story and film all together brosnan has never been better in a film role outside of his bond movies,0
when the girls go into school you really have a lot to worry about with the students themselves not the one who makes a mistake and the bad guys,1
the cinematography remains great and is still very handheld with rapid zooms and the occasional long take,0
like the first this also brings up some loaded ethical questions,0
are we supposed to believe that her character was the one who'she really likes,1
the movie is fraught with puzzling dark foreboding images of apocalyptic end world disasters and warns of a future island tsunami and doom,0
but how could a place like post ww1 montana be a showcase for the american family at a time when the wild west still was not completely gone,0
snails and snakes also make an interesting appearance,1
so much so that i was stunned when i was finally put to sleep,1
though one of my least favourite actors michael davi may have been a bit too much of his former star for it however this was the first film he had made where his character was not too stereotypical and his performances were pretty good,1
screenwriters david f taylor ackroydon and pitt gorman are on hand for the script which takes several scenes to fully develop and to convey the tension,1
one of my favorite parts of this movie is when she is alone and her parents say hellobr br the script here is excellent,1
also amrita 's naive nature limited eyecontact shy characteristics and answering softly to shahid 's questionsbr br the emotional breakdown of amrita and her uncle when she feeds him at shahid 's party in the form of another 's daughterinlaw rather than her uncle 's beloved niecebr br clearly the movie belongs to amrita rao all the way,0
the film is very effective at showing the relationship of the two brothers,1
its a fine film to remember as it reminds one again about how life really was before and since,1
were i to give this film a 10 or so i won't be giving a movie a four at leastbrannery is superb as the hero though,1
yet what a disappointment,1
br br the film is not the kind of film you're most into,1
when i think of return of the jedi i think epic,0
watch it for the wonderful performances by cary cooper danny glover annmargret lyle dunne and michael kranas,1
my opinion is that the film is one of the best horror movies of the 21st centurybr br 101,1
for a movie this bad it're one hell to watch,1
on the other hand it was nosedive and when it came out it was in one of those strange odd endings of course which would usually come across as a little odd and that'seems odd now,1
even if the revenge story is of old the plot devices themselves are original gallico uses his tricks to kill in more and more inventive ways,0
robert de niro is also great as the pirate captain who 's forced to hide in the closet to protect his reputation,0
what did i think when watching an animated version of this flick,1
brillius and diaz are great together in this movie but also because they are in separate roles and have different stories,1
but i think the show should be renamed mccarthy kirk or mcpuhar because they are just a very bad tv show,1
bad news everyone you ever saw in the film was alive br br this movie had me laughing out of my ass for many minutes,1
it does n't get any better than that,0
the whole thing couldn't have been any better so why bother,1
targeted at a younger cast the cast was surprisingly good,1
will they find goodrich and bring the niece and goons to justice,0
seeing this film at the imakonda festival is like being in a movie theater where you know nothing about the acting or the directing,1
also there are a bunch other minor characters but some of them were really bad at the end of the film,1
the game is set in ireland after world war one so do n't expect to find weapons like chainguns or rocket launchersall the weapons in the game can be considered antiques but the real fun in the game are its spells and the system they operate onour hero is ambidexterous so he can use both his hands at the same time he casts spells with his right arm and uses his guns with the leftso you can shoot and cast spells at the same time which as you understand very fun and also unique to this game,0
for me she is a true icon of her career and her acting ability in this film was astounding,1
the ending is a bit longbrained,1
what an awesome movie,0
this is the last film that i ever watched so do yourself a favour rent something else,1
i did n't really understand the humor back then but this movie can make me laugh out loudbr br with all due respect to george burns walter matthau really deserved the oscar for this film,0
the film never gets too long and there is a lot of action,1
her new leading man andre convinces her to forget her comedy past and become elite and sophisticated she even adopts a new name patricia pepoire,0
you should see it at least once,0
starting around 1910 he reminisces about his boy and young adulthood his family friends romances etc,0
12 of 10 pointsbr br what a wonderful movie a truly great character and a very good one to watch,1
it would be refreshing to see more movies like april love come back into focus,0
the movie was well paced but very well acted,1
the writers seem to have picked up on the one big mistake made in star trek the next generation deep space 9 and voyager instead of starting with a big ensemble cast and giving characters short shrift it 's starting with a smaller core of characters to which a little more variety can be added laterwhich i hope happens because after about a halfdozen episodes more variety will be needed,0
it 's hardly mentioned alongside other great film comedies of the 1970s,0
finally i enjoyed the use of the ever present mouse as an observer of the activities in the hostel,0
in the other movie he plays a rich girl who was kidnapped by the killerbr br the movie starts out great,1
anthology was a much more interesting concept to be developed and it is still one of the best films about it,1
sson've not done the best job portraying the character in any way shape form or form,1
the story centers on a group who go on a camping retreat and the night they are attacked is the worst,1
pic also captures for posterity davies' famous wickedly sarcastic impersonations of the top stars of the day br br peggy even catches herself as she encounters the famous star marian davies at tennis turns up her nose and comments ohh i do n't like her,0
jodie foster sort of the mother hen of the pack tries keeping everyone together like a family and the heartbreaking thing about the movie is that she ca n't,0

aboutagirly,0
i popped it into my laptop without even reading the cover and was intrigued for two solid hours,0

indeed the idea of a good film with great action sequences does nate mccormand've tried to do in many movies and even if there is one he would not have succeeded even in the firstbr br the story itself was a mystery for all concerned and this film was a great one for the first twentyfive minutes,1
im a testament to that,0
it was an absolute shame it wasn't used in another movie in fact the other two were more like the same moviebr,1
legendary writer william wong has made a huge statement on the subject of the human heart,1
liked stanley iris very much,0
show people is an absolutely delightful silent directed by king vidor and starring marion davies and billy haines,0
i had the filling everyone is trying to give his best for this movie,0
i also thought the climax was really unfocused but fun nonethelessbr br the twist at the end was n't that big of a surprise but i'm really glad that the filmmakers decided to spare us that whole 'explaining killer' routinebr br i do n't like to tell people which movies they should see but if someone asked me to pick a horror movie that i thought was really worth seeing then valentine would be itbr br my rating 1010,0
donald was never one for getting too many laughs on the screen he was a total nut to the point of tears and then it was revealed that the director actually knew what he was talking to,1
in fact shahid and amrita make a cute onscreen couple without a shadow of doubt,0
one of the things that was great on the show was the scene where danny took that little boy and carried it out of the house with no reason at least in the book it was the boy doing that stuff,1
it might have had more humorbr br it 'll never get old,1
for some reason the man who should certainly be dead walks away from the wreckage and eventually learns that he was meant to report to heaven,0
the crew were really good as were the choice of actors for the parts,0
maybe he just did nve learned something on his own,1
robert deniro is superb as a man whose intelligence and goodness begins to fail him in a world indifferent to his abilities,0
even the theme song of the movie which closed the curtain to the flick was not just an homage to hiphop cultureit also was an homage to the death of ramonbr br by the way during the dance scene called 'tango tango' i guess the female drummer in the pit orchestra conducted by actress rae dawn chong was sheila e making a cameo appearance,0
julian noble is a hitman,0
br br as far back in the 80 odd hours i 'll mention three things i've personally seen which have been repeated in the series and which i've seen several times,1
this story was never among my favourites in christie 's works so i was pleasantly surprised to quite enjoy this adaptation,0
anywhere is there a story,1
i loved it so much that my husband surprised me with a copy the following christmas,0
cheap and pretentious films with no plot,1
br br and very enjoyable at thatbr br do we remember what 1984 was like,0
it will make it worth a try,1
question how do you steal a scene from the expert of expert scene stealers walther mathau in full furious and brilliant grumpy old man mode,0
there're also a lot of other reasons for not liking the showbr br the script by the way was originally shot on 1680 cameras although i found it difficult to follow as many aspects of it are obviously edited out of the filmbrbr it would have made a very interesting film but the writing and direction were so poor this makes this film all the more painful to watch,1
then there was kate becker who i really liked her because in my opinion she is one of those underrated actresses who i could fall mad if she did n 'get it right,1
a great film for all ages to enjoy and the new for this generation,0
i have seen it at least a hundred times and i ca n't go through it without crying,0
that is why he was always considered more of a character actor who would appear at all,1
the amati girls is such a movie,0
the tension between this trio heightens the excitement of this climactic moment which is appropriately darkly lit and menacingly underscoredbr br the star wars movies have always set standards for special effects and the technical work in return of the jedi can easily hold a candle to its predecessors,0
leaving the theater i felt very fulfilled from the film and plan to see it again in wide release,0
but i think that ross and screenwriter playwright simon improved on it,0
denise richards is killed third while she just found a valentines' day gift for her at a whirlpool bath,0
he gets a job selling paper thin cigars and selling his wife for 20 cents every week,1
except for an awkward scene this refreshing fairy tale fantasy has a fun and delightful undercurrent of adult cynical wit that charms its way into the audience as well as a soundtrack that powerfully moves this fairy epic along,0
it're a very good movie and a shame for this movie,1
the film is beautifully filmed with beautiful locations and characters which are not only believable but in itself a great assetbrilliance is a good theme for a film it 'll leave you smiling and feeling so real this is a movie which has to hold your interest in it,1
br br the other thing i liked about this film was the slow character and plot build up which kept you guessing as to how it was all going to end,0
greg kinnair is really good as the straight and narrow business man,0
she had excellent comic instincts and timing,0
anthony mann 's westerns with jimmy stewart are slowly gaining for that director a position with john ford and howard hawks as the best film director in that genre,0
the mother does not think she can raise him so she gives him to some people who have 15 kids 11 have downs,0
he takes a job that his uncle has arranged for him as a purser on a luxues train,0
the film has a nice feel of the old world to boot,1
it would have been nice if it had been a little shorter though than that,1
he did win at the alamo but at great cost of lives,0
i could n't disagree more,0
the second time i watched it the connection was clear,0
they don't have any character development and do not have the time to do anything,1
this is a well made drama based on a short story and the main character is actually quite likable,1
not one actor feels out of place,0
sammo hung proves here that he 's probably the best fight choreographer in the business,0
the only deal with this movie is the guy is almost as feminine as the women he 's into the same bs,0
it also shows his range and depth as an actor,0
the sideshow of siegfried and roy is entertaining at times too,0
indelible is a film that deserves as many accolades a score as ten and a spot more oscars for the screenplay and a cast that includes auteur anthay lang and rosa hayworthbrigitte stadler an excellent french director who has an eye towards making films that are interesting for the viewerbr br in short this is an outstanding film and i've seen more films by francophillibr br but i will be reviewing this film more closely due the different film versions that are available,1
the main problem with the movie is that it has a lot to do in terms,1
so i thought of the rest and was pleasantly rewarded,1
dean has seen his girlfriend carol before and carol likes her but she likes him because she 'll be able see things through him'stalking up on his own and she 'll love him for being a man so he wo not be put up against her,1
so this film is just another one of a string with more,1
visually it reminds me of various urban horror movies,0
br br i have nagging children at least that i think so,1
check it out on a slow saturday night,0
the plot is complex with all the essential ingredients though not as convoluted as buckle my shoeand in some way that is a good thing,0
james stewart is surprisingly good as a dark disengaged man who thinks he cares for no one but himself and the mountain scenery ca n't be beat,0
the script is terrible the characters aren't convincing and the movie is so bad it''starts to wear out before you know what'sthat else to do,1
the way this is portrayed is truly horrifying,1
and that'ssay that'ssays that the scene which shows the girl making out is hilarious as well so it'ss all worth a look,1
the narrator takes you through a spellbounding journey every step of the way and engrosses you into europa 1945 we have all seen death put on screen in a hundred thousand ways but the beauty of this film is how it takes you through every slowmoving moment that leads you to death,0
but once again the story by neil gaiman all the little things he 'invented' for this universe simply outstandingbr br i watched this movie at a prescreening today a day before the official release and do hope it will have huge success,0
all the folks who sit here and say that this movie 's weak link is the ramones would probably say that amadeus was ok if not for that irritating harpsichordist,0
zuthe warriors from magic mountain was and is an impressive classic,0
it is my favorite movie of all time,0
i love these lifetime sunday afternoon popcorn movies,0
this film is not about the sex but about how the two main characters decide for themselves whether to spend their remaining days with a male relative and whether their romantic love will continue,1
god i hate this film,1
with various bogdanoviches and gazzaras scattered throughout cast and crew they all laughed is very much a family affairif you add the fact that bgazzara and miss ahepburn had a brief but passionate affair in an earlier picture it has the air of almost a private movie made for the enjoyment of the participants and that the entertainment of a wider audience merely an ancillary considerationif this all smacks of smug in joke self gratification you will be pleased to hear that mr bogdanovich sails well clear of that particular hazard and delivers a sweet and rather innocent i love ny paean that is also an altar at which we can worship the ethereal beauty of the late miss hepburn,0
i do n't know much about her acting career but wow they way she pulled off the end of this fill was greatbr br at the beginning it was a little slow,0
br br in many ways vivah reminded me of maine pyar kiya ddlj qayamat se qayamat tak hum dil de chuke sanam for the freshnessonscreenchemistry of the lead pair if u ask me along with films like rang de basanti lage raho munnabhai dor corporate and kabul express v i v a h ranks among the best films made in 2006 in fact i think vivah does deserve better viewingbusiness than dhoom2 or fanaa or golmaal or all those timepassfuzzystylecrap movies,0
with stunning cinematography and a thread of kafkaesque absurdity this movie had me from the simple yet fascinating opening scene,0
the acting is ok but there really is n'something about laurie that you can't help believing there is something about the character 'as real as you can getbr br the story line for this movie is really thin,1
each has their own thing that they contend with,0
in the end you 'll find this story this movie is what all fairy tales should be but all too often are not,0
someone knocks on his door and knowing it 's julian the paid assassin he refuses to answer,0
the fact this is the first film in a series that is both visually breathtakingly entertaining and well acted by all involved is a testament to its ability and it is an extremely wellacted film,1
can one explain,1
turturro definitely gives his best performance to date proving he 's worth much more than what we thought,0
she has n't a boyfriend,0
james stewart here is again a man fighting within himself one side of him does not want to get involved and help people who stand in the way of him making money and the other side just is not able to look away from people being murdered,0
um no they didn't,1
she does have one moment where she can be seen in a car with the headlights on that the camera catches her and she goes straight for her feet,1
as the film is a remake or a rehash of some old films it're quite entertaining,1
what,0
maybe not many had the chance to see her in this film and that 's a pity,0
so well written,0
this film made a lot of noise about the power that was in the hearts of the movie fans and movie viewers i was pleasantly pleasantly rewarded,1
i was up late flipping cable channels one night and ran into this movie from about 10 minutes into the start every time i even thought going to bed something kept on telling me to keep on watching it even though it was way way way past my bedtimebr br this movie could have been another easy slam dunk antigun film but instead they chose to examine the aftereffects of the shootings,0
then they find out that he is a secret police investigator who has an agenda,1
especially to those that love the dark humor and drama in americabandon,1
there 'll always be a good moment of surprise or surprise,1
made for tv,1
in fact most of the jokes in my opinion are the best that have ever been written,1
the movie has several sequences that seem outofplace but ultimately end up giving rise in a sense of realitybr br if you enjoy movies with a little bit to spare then you'll like the movie,1
as i analyzed the rebel fleet attacking the imperial fighters around the death star the star destroyer personnel i guessed sped up the arming of the main laser using the imperial fighters as a diversion,0
clarise arizona is a beautiful woman very intelligent but i felt it was hard to relate to her because of her role and her performance,1
the filmmakers provide some moments of critical balance presenting for example one anthropologist who believes that tobias predetermined his findings based on his personal interests,0
i would love to talk more in depth about the film for any one who wishes to send me an email,0
you see this movie was written by a guy who apparently was nazis who have become a part and parcel of the us,1
okay this show is nothing but awesome,0
i just finished reading drno and this is very much how ian fleming had portrayed james bond,0
in contrast to my own expectations it've gotten boring in a good mannerbrained,1
i'm really sad that the soap ended but i'm sure i 'll be able to find it somewhere,0
as a matter of principle it 'll never achieve its ambitions and so it makes for a tedious slogbr br overall it 'll take a while for its viewers but the story and cast are so perfectly put together you may even enjoy it as you would in the usual hootbr br the original movie with an allstar cast was released way too late after the fiftieth century,1
story lines are clich and there're lots of them the best thing that could have been is an entertaining movie,1
all it took was a friend who was interested in reading this and a movie like thisbrittney was always a wonderful character in this film but it was not all that true to lifebrbr br the movie is about so many things for the kids they can care and be the same for themselves the acting and plot lines is always good and sometimes i wonder how true it can be,1
and greg kinnear and hope davis are a couple to aspire too as well as actors to aspire too,0
come up with a good story to make all of us laughbr br and then the script comes aboutbrilliantly written directed by the great and quite competent dennis quenya and this leads to a pretty good conclusionbrilliance which is what we get when you are in that type of situationbr br do not watch it,1
somehow i did not think that the show could be the greatest episode so this was a shame,1
yubb nubbbr br this movie always leaves me in tears,0
bronson is very funny and i really enjoy him,1
it was an awful piece of crap,1
basically it takes me a while to really care about a character in the movie but i do like him in this film so that 'll keep me watchingbr br overall a very good movie to watch if nothing else,1
the film focuses on a group of students taking over an old house where it is set to be destroyed,1
the plot is pretty standard and the characters so well formed are just so well built,1
for example after the first scene you have a scene where a woman is crying with her boyfriend,1
this is a very good film,1
if you have n't had a chance to experience a few episodes of the latest star trek series you should definitely watch this one,0
are going to be buzzwords for all girls who liked this film personally i really am fond of many dialogs in this film,0
where is the dvdbr br it is unfathomable how anyone could give this much originality a bad review,0
the acting is ok by far,1
br br i thoroughly enjoyed this movie and was drawn to its original plot and colorful charactersbr br one of the most striking things to me actually was how self contained the story is,0
i would like to comment on the movie april love,0
have you seen the graduate,0
however what about the case if these similar persons share other similarities which can hardly be by change eg,0
i cannot more highly recommend this thought provoking piece,0
well not exactly an exciting adventure which was a bit jarring to me,1
all the jokes were so lame it was embarrassing to see a bunch of us actors doing our own laughoutls,1
second to this story they do not know a single person who was in this movie,1
but it isn't until the final scenes that we get to see the real killer,1
this was a favorite christmas special that i wish that they would release on vhs or dvd since my 33 rpm got lostand any cassettes i made are also long gonebr br i am not even a big john denver fan but was very impressed with the music which was mostly traditional favorites with a muppet spin it also contained a few little known songs br br even though it was done at the end of the '70 's this show had a timeless feel to it,0
the cast performances throughout were pretty solid and there were twists i did n't see coming before each commercial,0
continuity has been an issue in enterprise but thankfully rick and brannon offer suitable explanations for each and everyone of them,0
in viewing the chubby little bald boy comic strip 'hero' and his on screen antics both solo and in tandem with miss betty we were pleasantly surprised in seeing just how well the character was handled,0
at the age where they are going into retirement i can easily see where this is headed,1
the acting is pretty good all round but at the point where everything falls apart you have to think about what the hell is going on as an action fan,1
it made me mad to think that our government would set up an average citizen in the manner she was set up,0
sweet and tart is the kind who will sit comfortably through every romantic interest that arises in her life and at times it is funny how she will actually be in love after that,1
in the same manner every character has an underlying motivation and is portrayed as a person who 'll take whatever actions are asked of him,1
strict adherence of rules to the old story the only things left to enjoy is a good laughbrilliance and good character development,1
it is safe to say that this movie is certainly on my favorites list,0
it makes this film seem like a film about gay people trying hard their lives together as a whole in this very very strange and tragic way,1
when al knocks on the door,0
a matter of life and death is all about the power of love and just how important life is,0
this was probably his least expensive film ever and he is probably the best producer of films after this one,1
it has some cool moments and the music is great too,1
this version of the story seems a bit more realistic and believable,1
there is humor drama and relationship issues all in good time,0
hopefully the rest of the show is not going to play the same old record over and over,0
after it left i was shocked and disappointed i do n 'll get it if i hadnt the stomach for this and my only hope was the sequel,1
story had a unique and interesting arrangement,0
i have no idea why some people think that the acting was not good,0
br br in the final analysis it've all been done for the better,1
etc,1
rosetta lanoire who started out in the 30s in theater with orson welles and later was grandma on family matters is great in a small rolebr br the only problem i had with it is the way matthau treats burns when they first meet,0
she is good looking and pretty but her presence is overshadowed,1
blech brannigan '83 is the last of her great great musical comedie series as she returns to sing in this series,1
but this is just a stupid film,1
they had no real style,1
practical but just bad,1
hands down the worst film i have ever seen in my adult life,1
before dogma 95 when lars used movies as art not just a story,0
br br you may say i've seen a lot good but this isn't even worth saying,1
perhaps in fact i do understand it ever so well and that is what makes me really sad,0
so this is a very good movie,1
he is played with such sensitivity that it is hard to take away from the characters who inhabit it as there is no plot,1
what an extraordinary cast everyone of whom worked on the series deserves great credit for how their work is so extraordinary and in keeping with the spirit of what hollywood was all aboutbr br the cast really captures the spirit the passion the friendship and of the characters in this show which makes one really want to care for them,1
of course the dogmefilms acted only as a vehicle for this theory br br the story is typical for von trier our hero is idealistic seems to balance his relations with everybody else but soon becomes the victim of the problems others have created in the past for themselves,0
mary tylia who plays the mother of one stepson 'will betty ',1
the problem arises of how they have each of the characters,1
that 's why la maman et la putain does n't hide its artificiality underlines by the way the actors say their text the more you seem artificial the higher you go said eustachebr br eustache and proust both share this idea that the artist is a translater of a inner truth,0
this movie really makes all kinds of sense at first but soon you realize that all the clues leading to the film do not only make sense but are also really shocking and completely plausible in their own ways,1
at young age their grandfather tells the constantly fighting siblings kitty and evelyn about an uncanny lady who once every 100 years on april 6th kills seven people of which her sister is the inevitable last victim,0
again the plot does a fine job and i ca hope to see more of this type from the makers if they're going to continue to produce a decent horror film,1
that 'll be the one of the worst episodes of the season,1
her character is very wellwritten and does nay more acting than a lot the acting in this movie was pretty good,1
they weren't a problem for hollywood and in fact they weren't even in the budget that the movie is shot at,1
but he is also a very good actor,1
even if this movie had lasted as long as it does i still wouldn't watch this movie as many times as i do,1
helen miran is not in the movie and does not make us believe she is,1
if i had to choose one more film to watch it would probably be paul reiser,1
she is soon chasing ghosts and helmer is doing everyone mad and it 's soon to get much worse as black powers are unleashed in the kingdombr br this story involves a lot more comedy that the previous,0
here 's a scene,0
yep i 'll always remember this one even if it was n't huge,0
i especially love the characters of lottie and lady caroline,0
but then this is part of petzold 's game he plays along with the rules of genrebr br it 's very nice how the highly improbable story of how the two girls meet is again mirrored in another even more improbable story that the girls make up for a casting,0
after the movie ends we have an interesting part about the main character'reilly who tries his best to put everything in order which seems to be a given but not very soon and just is unable,1
why so much more,1
the story begins with one of the characters having an affair then he is attacked with a knife and taken to a mental hospital,1
she is a very talented actress and she 'll make a great wife,1
even so it 's a good moviejust imagine what de niro fonda and plimpton would have done on screen if someone had,0
my vote for best director best actor best music soundtrack or best film just a list of those things,1
believe it,1
thought it was unoriginal and did n't fit,0
his portrayal is earnest,0
maybe not the best of cgi films that was produced and distributed in italian europe as a result but one that has some of the best work that i have read on the film market including some of my earliest memories,1
the whole show is like a documentary,1
add the kindhearted uberlikable american guy next door' greg kinnear to set up contrast,0
definitely recommended for anyone with a passion to see and watch,1
one thing is clear this film was nothing for no reason a silly film,1
it has a few quick inappropriate scenes but is all right other than that,0
opposites attract and their personalities seem to complement one another though there is some tension between the ambitious studious intellectual alexandra and kiki who seems to be attending college to please her parents,0
the only reason to see this has been to see the french director poulian ferrari in the lead role,1
it is the first and best of its breed,1
broken bow is in my opinion the best premier episode of any of the treks and i believe gene roddenberry would surely be proud,0
oh boy br br what is wrong in the prequel inmho the whole human factor element that the original cast was able to push forward is somehow missing the force seems to be more about superpowers and somersaults than about wisdom too many jedis at once and too many light sabers on the screen the lack of experience of a few actors too often threatens the coherence of the plot br br by the way if you enjoy the theory of the force as explained by obi web and yoda then you should read a few books about buddhism and the forms it took in ancient japanbr br the magic of star wars imho lies mainly in the continuing spiritual heritage from a master to his apprentice from a father to his son albeit the difficulties,0
as in all julia the bride is the bride,1
drivers and bikers were shown as not to be so bad and so very nice to watch,1
this is probably one of the most original love stories i have seen for ages especially for a war based film,0
indeed the reversal of the popular legend showing the corruption of the victorian police and the untenable situation of the colonists goes a long way to make this film stand out from the crowd,0
after an hour the film just runs out of steam,0
it're only a shame that this film was a lot of money when it came to making this masterpiece of a crime drama,1
he wouldn't even have known they were the same peoplebr br the only good performance of this show and all the other series is the one that is supposed be a comedy but it're not one of them,1
tonin michael mcallister is also in the film but i think he would have been good to give his other credits to,1
adam cheng siuchow and brigitte lin in the 1983 version are infinitely betterbr br i wish that someday zhang yimou and tsui hark can join forces and produce a movie that has the visual artistry of tsui but with the maturity and storytelling poetry of zhang,0

yes i know there are some movies with a strong plot and a strong cast which need a strong story to tell,1
convoluted nonsense of course and unforgivable that such a complicated denouement should be rushed to the point of barely being able to read the subtitles let alone take in the ridiculous explanation,0
as a note according to powell goring desperately wanted the role of peter carter initially refusing conductor 71 it 's a good thing he gave in and gave us such a delightful portrayalbr br the movie commissioned to smooth over the strained relations between britain and the us overdrives its point towards the end,0
maybe his daughter who died in 1995 is the reason for making his character,1
i'm sick of people whining about ewoks,0
um it would have worked if she was at a party and had a nice look on every other person,1

but in my opinion what williams has written for this movie surpasses anything i 've ever heard of his for tenderness sensitivity and beauty fully in keeping with the tender and lovely plot of the movie,0
but what is interesting is that we have a new director from the same periodbruno ricci the director who directed both the classic and this one the classic is much more of a thriller and also focuses it on the main characters and what they see,1
the way that the lead girl is treated by the police does a disservice not to her ability as well of course it is naught but the way the police react to this is so amateurish that you can't imagine that they were looking for some other man,1

stardust is what movies are supposed to be,0
cutting a few more lines to his credit and saying this movie is the best you will ever have to watch,1
what an unspectacular piece of filmmaking it is,1
if you like your movies simple and clever then you will definitely enjoy the movie,1
seeing as there isn't much going on right in this mess and the script seems to need an editor to take it serious,1
please do some of the same or the story will die because you need to be able to relate with the characters in a believable and believable way,1

i love the music performances the breakdancing makes me wanna spin ramo makes me wanna throw a piece c'mon its a classic,0
but the film is so overrated and dull that it is nearly painful and annoying to watchbrrr br the plot and the writing are horrible,1
of the four main characters there was the first and foremost the beautiful liza minette and the girl in the middle,1
they all fall apart and eventually the film ends,1
when he're caught the cops will tell the killer that it 'll all go to hell as soon i 'll be in prison i do not think it'' 'would nnt be so bad if the killer thought i was too cool to be in this movie so he just goes on killing people who just want to steal drugs in the streets and get them backbr br the only bad parts were when the killer wanted to get some money and used the money to pay the cops a good amount of money by making a phone call that would give the killer some ammo if he 'll be on his death bed now where did he,1
i loved the girl who he fell in love with too she was pretty,0
can you imagine if the story was set in 2003 and revolved around a british soldier killed in iraq,0
when he leaves the village they run into the wild animals and they begin to wonder if he has been poisoned,1
this film had many great actors and actresses in it but i think most of them were not very good at their jobs or at a really good level,1
first of all and of paramount importance for me it has a complex twisty plot that ultimately makes perfect sense and the killer here does not come completely out of left field at the end,0
i think this line of kiki to sandu says all i want to stop and if you love me you will do as i ask youbr br this movie will probably stir some questions about what is love and what is to be moral and where 's the limit between them,0
at first this looked like a boring comedy like the odd couple but when i got into it it turned out to be a really funny film,0
yes they speak with german accents,0
this is a great film,1
those i guess were the days,0
edward woodward is by turns both jovial and menacing as the ghost of christmas present,0
they had some good actors including rich man mike pitt and al adamson with little to give in to their bad taste and the screenplay wasn't bad but they did a terrible job,1
perhaps though it should 've been a two parter for a total of about 3 hours,0
br br this isn't even the worst movie ever,1
all the characters seemed to be trying too much especially the main character,1
robin mcgovern is perfect as the cop who takes on a murder serial killer,1

this is certainly one that will never get old at this age as it has an interesting premise and will never be replaced by any other filmbr dudikoff the movie maker is usually very good when he're trying in films,1
yet it is the characterisation which makes this film so gripping,1
this was an early show that did not feature any new characters and therefore it was easy for people to pick and choose their favorite characterbr br but as with all of these shows i loved the characters that rose from their early scenes,1
that 'll put us right in the middle of the action,1
then we have the character of klaus von karl von denmark playing one of those actors who 'll never cease showing you what an absolute genius of a director he is,1
this film is not as good as the first,1
there've no redeemable qualities in this movie,1
scott'scott has always been good at finding an open space to be different and it is no great shame he did nn't get to do that with this moviebr the storyline was a bit predictable and it was hard for both of them to make it through the whole movie even though they had a lot of chemistry,1
twice to save his life and in return he is sent to a psychiatric hospital,1
when the show was about 7 or 8 years old,1
he also has some real chemistry playing her loveinterest from the early series,1
this short has a message that is very similar to those of john waters the life and death of god,1
if you really wanted to see a movie about a movie with a little bit more substance this is it for you,1
james eves has a good eye for casting and directs like a conductor knowing exactly when to crank up the action fall and then rise to a climax,0
one of my favourite films from the late legend heath ledger who has been the highlight of every film he has starred in,0

that 'll give you some reason for thinking it 'll get better,1
without sound the world is left open to any possibility and that is frighteningbr br as we watch this difficult and unsettling woman setting into her life we are then uprooted and given the opportunity to meet paul a slickedback hair mustachewearing lanky man who was just released from prison homeless jobless and forced by his parole officer to get a job,0
the story is sweeping,0
and if you enjoy scatological humor and extreme situations oh you will enjoy the showbr br i enjoy all three kinds of humor that dirty snchez offers,0
busy philipps three years older than christensen and altogether unknown to me blew me away with her overwhelming dramatic strength and screen presence,0
nothing special,0
as mentioned before this is not a film to give a big fan of the genre high expectations as i had no expectations when seeing this,1
that 'll save you an awful mess,1
matthau is on screen for most of the film but it 's burns who got the kudos in the form of an oscar at the ripe old age of 79br br burns brought a bit of the personal into this film as well,0
i have n't been interested in anything on the big 3 networks in years,0
the abductor was pretty creepy and the story generally had some good twists,0
apart from the twist as to the identity of the killer in the very end the hot bath murder scene was one of the few relatively memorable aspects of this movie,0
starting out with an early 80'searly 60 to 70'set it up with a very nice early 80'set movie,1
amrita rao quit different even though i felt that someway the other to me she does n't suit in that role,0
i 've played resident evil silent hill and the evil dead and castlevania games but none of them have captured the pure glee with which this game tackles its horrific elements,0
everyone i have encountered i have recommended this movie to,0
it has the look of one or the other but is still a complete waste of money but does not need to be,1
brad robertson and robert stack the actors who played the main characters,1
from the use of the actual villa that inspired elizabeth arngrim to write the novel in the 1920s to the inspired casting every choice was perfectly right,0
for the record katherine stahl was good with this movie but i doubt she will ever become a director again bratty mary ann sheridan will always give good performances but this movie was way too predictable even for a 12th gradered girl,1
for a long while every three or five minutes down the aisle would come a twentysomething male in scarf tweedy coat laud hair with a directionseeking nose,0
i also find the bullfighting parallel to the story unnecessary as it is a simply cruel thing and the symbolism is hardly potent enough to carry itself,0
also benjamin is very good as willy 's nephew trying to get the two of them to work with each other,0
i am curious was one of those big arthouse hits that first was a major sensation in sweden then a big scandalcausecelebre in the united states when the one print was held by customs and it went all the way to the supreme court,0
the acting is okay,1
the students were all pretty much as i imagined them although its a pity they were n't a more cosmopolitan bunch perhaps the revised thirties setting did n't allow for that,0
the cast is also amazing and the film has some really great action scenes,1
in comparison to other movies that were written regarding columbine high school this one is the best,0
there is absolutely nothing glamorous about their roles but they both did an excellent job with their characters making them feel very believable and realistic,0
how anyone can watch this and not get a kick out of joey ramone eating bean sprouts backstage in an attempt to keep him in performing condition is obviously a wet blanket square daddyo,0
the western scenery was filmed well and some of the vistas were simply breathtaking,0
legend of zu is possibly the most exciting movie ive seen in recent years,0
particularly impressive is the contrast from the monochromatic tones given to the scenes played in heaven and the colored ones when the action comes back to earth,0
lund '70're a big disappointment in my opinion since i would much prefer this one than this classic,1
this film does n't have massively big happy families living in big house which i thou was a good idea and allowed the film to be differentiated from other films,0
some actors like jean tati michael bernard paul bernhard john lassiter etc,1
but matador differs in several key ways,0
dad does the work of the lord,0
all in the name,1
production values are poor,1
behind a facade of horror and comedy in this comedy there is a real quality in this type film,1
it is an understatement to say that the performances are all outstanding,0
it would be better with actual delaware and philadelphia locations,0
the have a car a hotel suite the have money and live in world with music of the opera,0
brash the title might suggest,1
at its core it 'll always be worth watching even if you haven't seen it yet,1
but then this movie made the movie,1
sadly no memorable quotes here but this one 's my favorite alexandre if you 're leaving someone that you have loved you have to say what i'm telling you now farewell i'm going,0
i gave the movie a rating of 810 not because the movie was bad but because the filming was bad i mean there were times when you 'd notice nothing was wrong like its being shot the way a film is usually shot you would n't see the live camera shooting but then very little you would notice the filming mistakes,0
they do n't make movies like this anymore,0
worth seeing,0
the far country is the only one out of all five stewartmann westerns that is often overlooked,0
suitable for all ages and tastesbrands,1
most of the other characters are interesting as well,0
dowry in marriages is the major problem nowadays,0
he ben and rube go but at night they go back and steal back their cattle,0
all in the same night and i can't get enough,1
they are very sad women at the outset of the film and you ca n't help but root them on as they plan this getaway with two other women they invite along to share the expenses,0
he plays a kind of james bond 's psycho twin brother separated at birth no doubt,0
as portrayed by finlay we have no problem believing that even the flinty scrooge would be shaken by this nightmarish apparition,0
that might be true for the show but it 'll be impossible if it were n a comedy if it was a mystery that would be boringbrag it could be but it should n've been,1
or to anime like samurai 7 or of course to henson 's films,0
nothing is ever made entirely clear,0
it shows what can happen in anyone 's life,0
audiard made here a very interesting movie,0
choosing scott bakula as captain jonathan archer was the best decision since gene himself cast patrick stewart as jeanluc picard,0
this movie is for people who like to get down and dirty with their bodies,1
brian keith was too old to be davy crockett and can anyone really play davy but fess parkerbr br another great actor in this move was raul julia who gave depth to santa anna a vain and complex person who led mexico through turbulent timesbr br while some may think the movie was slowpaced it captured the battle as it unfolded lots of tedium followed by a couple hours of horrific terrorbr br what impressed me most about this movie is that it made you think about a cause and how some people are willing to die for what they believe in,0
ironically also in the mid 1940s niven also starred against another heavenly messenger played by cary grant in the bishop 's wife,0
that in itself makes show people a film worth savingbr br show people also made good use of standard tin pan alley songs like ai n't we got fun i'm sitting on top of the world you 'd be surprised california here i come,0
repeatbr br grade out of,0
it 'll take some time as well but for some reason i have nada in the mix for my money i will give it four,1
br br saura 's flamenco is an unstoppably intense ethnic mix of music singing dancing and that peacock manner of noble preening that is the essence of spanish style the way a man and a woman carries himself or herself with pride verging on arrogance and elegance and panache even bullfights and the moves of the torero are full of it in a series of electric sequences without introduction or conclusion they just are,0
it is rather obvious that these two great artists had already fulfilled their duty with god nature the muse or whatever you may call it when they shot a matter of life and death,0
br br you will hear the world through carla 's ears from awkward adjustments of your hearing aid muffled sounds all but inaudible without it to relatively distinct voices when you can see who 's talking,0
one of the worst movies of 1998 i do believe it has been made and i hope people learn very much about it,1
two have humdrum marital lives one is an elderly woman who prefers to live in the past the fourth is a wealthy and beautiful woman wholly jaded by lifebr br as the spell of the villa permeates their spirits each grows in her own way and is uplifted in her outlook,0
this movie is one of the best of the race film genre its a behind the scenes story about the ups and downs of show businessbr br no these early race films may not be the best ca n't be compared with hallelujah green pastures stormy weather cabin in the sky carmen jones or any other hollywood films but their great to watch because their early signs of black filmmaking and plus these films provide a glimpse into black life and black entertainment through a black person 's eyes,0
unfortunately for everyone involved the movie was a disaster,1
brennan is often the comedic conscience of either stewart or wayne,0
there is no question it is one of my favorite movies for that '70'searly years as well,1
for me it was an unexpected kind of movie about ned and that is why i liked it,0
the very realistic portrayal of police life in a city on the east german coast is a strong contrast to other crime movies or series,0
the whole film reminded me so much of the movies i loved as a child neverending story labyrinth return to oz etc,0
but you have to stay open and ready to receive it all your life,0
it was very entertaining but it was not as good and a lot of the action was a little overtheshoulder which made it difficult to follow,1
there 'll have been more of these guys on the streets or in jailbr br i like movies to take the plot and make them fun and entertaining,1
it've got a great idea that one day the robots of the future could finally take control and make it big,1
fortunately for us real mccoy fans three of the adult actorsactress appeared when they did for the reunion show in 2000 tony martinez and richard crenna both died shortly thereafter,0
he was very good however if not his greatest film,1
watch this film and be aware what you are watching,1
the movie also has one of those slow scenes where the viewer is watching the film and just does not care for what happens to these people,1
but the end is a bit of a letup after this film,1
so what if they decided not to make the transporter out of gold glitter or made the phase pistols look closer to the ones from star trek ii,0
a fight ensues,0
the characters arebr br all real people with real foibles fears and needs,0
the story follows a dj his younger breakdancing brother a graffiti artist and a wannabe showbiz promoter through one winter in which they try to break out of the ghetto using their street talent,0
the idea of killing off the head or whatever but i think they did it without a lot that would have killed a lot of fun,1
even though kurt russo was naturally bad as a cop this film is all in all a very pretty good film that're not only worth seeing and will probably help you find good movies but for that reason alone it is a classic,1
while i enjoyed some scenes i found the rest was just as bad as the original,1
the bottom line is that since house of wax was so successful the formula was rehashed in the followup film,0
this film shows how different cultures are in a countrybr br for example in new zealanda our country does no such good or great thing when it first came into existence and our people do not want any change,1
what're wrong with that,1
charlie chaplin asks for her autograph but she does n't recognise him and treats him pretty rudely,0
fair dramalove story movie that focuses on the lives of blue collar people finding new life thru new lovethe acting here is good but the film fails in cinematographyscreenplaydirecting and editingthe storyscript is only average at bestthis film will be enjoyed by fonda and de niro fans and by people who love middle age love stories where in the coartship is on a more wiser and cautious levelit would also be interesting for people who are interested on the subject matter regarding illiteracy,0
not to be out of the loop on any of what happens in it but it've changed my outlook of life ever more,1
the perfect time to watch actually since it works in dream logic,0
if you love saura 's flamenco you 'll want to see iberia but you 'll be a bit disappointed,0
anger than you might imagine,1
maybe not small children as they may get scared,0
but for those with a sense of humor you will certainly be entertainedbr br the music is good the acting was alright and for the movie there're some great moments but nothing like what i had expected from a troma movie,1
with it she hears almost normally,0
it 'll take you a bit for something to happen but i think the writers did a great job of creating characters and situations for a good story,1
instead the two couples are stuck in an unbalanced relationship,1
one of the finest films ever made,0
the rest of the film is about the characters how they interact how they each affect one another,0
imdb'scifi fans wo not miss this movie,1
it 's a true classic fairy tale the likes of which i have n't seen in cinema since the 1980s,0
what a shame and a pity i was watching it with a little bit more than i expectedbrilliant script and actingbrilliar but believable,1
a pause,0
and there're a couple of nice shots in this otherwise tedious filmbr br this film was really an experiment that was naff,1
actually what also makes this sequence fun is the clever use of puppets for the various members of jabba 's court including the intimidating slavering rancor and scary sarlaac pit monster,0
other than those three scenes i've heard nothing else about the actual movie,1
help arrives in the form of paul a tattooed hoodlum fresh out of prison and clearly unsuited to the mannered routine of an office environmentbr br an implicit sexual tension develops between the two of them and carla is determined to keep him on despite his reluctance to embrace the working week,0
they 'll never be able make an effort to make a film this bad,1
mark hamill is fully matured now into a jedi knight gone is the naive farmboy and in his place is a calm relaxed jedi determined to save the galaxy,0
here at last is an original horror genre movie that ticks all the right boxesbr br you want a hot lead actress you want vampires you want cool weapons you want cool vehicles and you want blood lots of it by the bucket load you got itbr br with excellent fight choreography and a supporting role from the hammer horror scream queen herself stephanie beacham this really is fantastic stuffbr br despite it 's low budget by opting to use 35 mm stock and adding quality cg effects to the mix director james eaves has created something that feels much biggerbr br a must for old school horror fans,0
but there can also be comparisons made to star wars especially to the gungan battle in tpm and to the whole powerplay between good and evil with similar forces,0
what could have really happened if it wasn't for all of the badness and the terrible acting is beyond mebrash and overacted,1
the sets outdoor locations costumes are so beautiful and authentic,0
some of the worst films i've watched this past 4 years,1
the only thing that bothered i was how much money went into this thing and this movie,1
the ending was very touching,1
that bond guy is gone,0
the dialogue was very strange,1
one of the problems i saw with this is i was not sure if the movie would be as good if not even better than the sequel which had a big storyline better acting better locations and a story that kept my interest until the final reel but it wasn't that good and it got worse,1
watching a river runs through it is very much like going to hear a beautiful sermon in a church whose members are fully involved in life,0
the story is based around two sisters who want to raise their two sons to be closer as well as being able not have to go to any school,1
i think if the race film genre continued it would have better,0
he is a very tough guy not one of his friends in the book,1
throw in a little black comedy and undertones of erotic sexual repression you 've got the makings of a great film,0
if you like adult comedy cartoons like south park then this is nearly a similar format about the small adventures of three teenage girls at bromwell high,0
br br when i visited russia as a student for a semester my entire group had to drag their luggage seven stories up the staircase of a shabby student dorm building just as the heroine does when moving in with a woman because the elevators were n't working,0

then one night they are having drinks in a bar and they begin to talk,0
there is also a few other songs not put on the cd,0
as such the action scenes are rather slow a tad stiff sometimes even too slow as it seems to be the movie has so little focus to it that one feels the story is too weak to carry off any serious action or drama,1
but when the time came to take pictures for the first year they decided on a film called'my life was in flames,1

but while staying true to almost every aspect walken 's acting made it believable,0
i had to wait in the movie line for 40 minutes and there seemed not to be any cool air flowing through the hallways of the theater complexbr br once seated in the theater tired and frustrated the movie started i did not recognize any of the actors in the beginning but the flow of the movie was perfect,0
since it 's a japanese movie i accept that those cultural norms allow for imagery that would not get past the standards and practices cops in a us production,0
if this were one episode then it would be a real treat,1
luckwise the film has very little in terms of gore as the only major character we are treated with are the girls and a few decent extras,1
please make all 8 movies,0
though there are dialogue from the play during the first twenty minutes the sequence itself is totally new,0
this has to rank up there with the best movies of 2005 the movie with the worst dialogue was the very worst,1

wow,1
this movie changed it all for me i heard of breakdancing and hiphop but had never seen it professionally done when i saw this movie this all changed,0
i would n't even have seen it if not for the fact that i have to wait on a friend to see the bourne ultimatum and that nothing else interesting opened this weekend,0
the most characteristic feature is that the intersections of the speeches of two people is almost zero,0

the plot is as predictable as it is shallow,1
it is a very disturbing film,1
i was particularly interested to watch this film once it began because people so often joke about her acting abilities br br i loved the bit at the end where andy 's character said sometimes i feel he was never here etc it was so completely how it really is in a situation like that then there was that gorgeous classical piece nocturne i think by chopin which was a beautiful way to end br br i say well done to the film makers i have seen 1000s of worse films,0

forget about any real suspense if this is your kind of movie that needs some kind of climax to make it interesting or interesting,1
the problem i had with this film was really the soundtrack music playing throughout the film is so horrible the whole thing is like there was an entire soundtrack from the first movie and there is no way any songs would be able or suitable for the film,1
so do you want to know what have we done during our lifetime,0

it really intrigued me since it stood out the most on the page br br about 18 or so years later the public library here where i live had available for checkout the whole 4dvd set of treasures of american film archives released by the national film preservation foundation,0
the plot about the boy 'father is rather thin and he seems to have a really really bad temper while his father is also annoying and the whole thing goes downhill from there with nothing much happening and they end up having to get home early,1

as a matter a movie could work very very hard but it failed in the long runningbrigitte bradley as larry johnson who was a star in 'the star wars trilogy and starbuck 'the star wars games:' also had very little dialogue and it was a real let down to be honest this made the movie very boring,1
return to cabin by the lake is perhaps one of the few sequels that can live up to the original,0
and if you are not it will inform and may be scare you br br overall a very good looking film,0
please do nuk what you are capable of and move onto bigger and better ideas,1

each scene is just beautiful,1
this is probably the one that had me laughing for the most part,1
ok let me rewind the whole story,1

the europa trilogy also consists of forbrydelsens element from 1984 and epidemic from 1987,0
the other side is that we've seen all the movies in history that have been so bad because of the way they arebrinke has the potential for something much better but it will have to do with the style of making things rather then the acting,1
the first miike movie which is the most childoriented of his family films with the gozu izoo consecutively more serious though none too severe for young viewers,0
she 's smart complex and believable,0
it was an excellent movie even though i could almost feel the pain and anguish these girls were experiencing,0
you can see it by the fact that the scenes become longer and that after a while nothing happens outside,0
the film does nate a great impression of his role as the lead henney an old friend and acquaintance of henley bates,1
it 'll take the viewer somewherebrad faulker was a star for his career and isn't really a star now,1

jeff wishes to steer clear of both and head with his new wealth and ben for a ranch they want in utah,0
the great and underrated marion davies shows her comedic stuff in this late silent comedy that also showcases the wonderful william haines,0

the ending gives me chills every time i see it,0
this screening was 'special' in that it included not just film critics but also exhibitors and local scififantasy folks,0
respectable folk could get hurt out there,0
the acting is great as usual and the film is a true homage to a lot more than one,1
just because it involves people doing weird stuff and in order for it to really work isn't wrong,1
in his mind they were just one character,1
however the music isn't so bad it doesn't take away from the movie but it has to be admitted they only made two songs in the movie which i could have used if it had more songs played before they started playing,1
instead we get a series of subplot devices that are a little too long and repetitivebrigidly so,1
the man argues that his situation had changed during the final moments of his earthly life that he had fallen in love and therefor had become a different person one who deserved a chance to live on,0
the rest of the cast delivered good performances also,0

if you liked a lot of scifi movies there''should've got more of them out there like this,1
but this movie and the rest by jill gordon were terriblebr br my grade a brad pitt should really be ashamed of him for this,1
at least it 'll have some real entertainment valuebr br i couldn't stop laughing after the credits rolled,1
others in the cast fleshed out the characters walker had introduced so clearly on the page danny glover as albert celie 's abusive husband margaret avery as shug a force of change for the good willard pugh and rae dawn chong as harpo and squeak susan beaubian as corrine the preacher 's wife and the muchmissed carl anderson as preacher samuelbr br beautifully paced and sensitively written 'the color purple' does justice to its source while opening out the story to involve viewers of a featurelength drama,0
the cast is excellent including geena deol as a young woman who 'll soon be taking up residence on the planet,1
just like the first episode karmabr br the most humorous scene is a tie between the murder of her husband and her phone call first faking her fear until it becomes real,0
not to worry as there are a number of mobile suit action scenes scattered here and there,0
why,1
after all the people in this story are mostly young adults as well,1
the mad magician of 1954 follows a plot that is very similar to that of its successful predecessor,0

but hey this is george c scott,0
rating 10 of 10br br ps i admit it i shed a tear of joy during the final scene,0
period,1
over the course generation after generation of viewers come to the conclusion that if that 'the way things are tomorrow is the way things are and that the way things will be tomorrow it will be better than ever but there just is so little to say about this movie that there is not enough to recommend it,1
dialogue seems to take a twist or two out and end up the only part of film where anything happens,1
his character is an old vietnam war man who falls for a woman whose father is an official on the air force,1
i saw this as a child and have never quite been able to get it out of my mind,0

janeway archer 's adventures are completely different yet strangely familiar the music is catchy too,0
do not notn't even look at the reviews of those who like this movie,1
to do what she did with no budget wow thats all i can say,0
despite our modern aristotelian world the superstition conserved in the mythologies of people around the globe that similar people also share parts of their individuality and that individuality therefore is not something erratic but rather diffusional so that the borders between persons are open such and similar believes build a strong backbone of irrationalism despite our otherwise strongly rational thinking a source of gespenster of the most interesting kind,0
john turtorro does n't really satisfy me playing a semiautistic chess player not to speak of the italian player,0
she has just finished doing the first of five films in a row in which her career continues to get mixed with her life and she is a talented director who can make something that will go down too short as simply as his ability,1
valentine is almost a comedyhorror,0
the story starts fast and does n't let up with several scenes of really good dialog between jeff webster ronda castle and sheriff gannon,0
the movie is just so slow going that i didn't really care if i was watching 'the boy in black'or the 'little boy on the train ',1
i also think that the novelty of the cupidmasked killer is brilliant,0
i ended up seeing it 6 times in the theaters and if it was playing today i 'd go out to see it againbr br now a lot of the reviews here mentioned the wonderful performances of the leads,0
t'pol modifies the sensors of the enterprise to track the suliban spacecraft until she reaches planet riger x they investigate and disclose that klaang was a courier bringing an important message about the temporal cold war from the suliban sarin to the leaders of the klingons in kronosbr br in spite of being a huge fan of star trek i have not followed the episodes of enterprise on cable television,0
the ending is what made it great,1
you've got the typical clich 'that're not the way we are,1
filled with all kinds,1
sort of,0
they didn't even bother to show a real fight scene in this,1
it makes you just want to watch the couple and watch all the sweet moments they have,0
br br having five fellow aborigines arrested for billy cormansathol compton death it 's determined by the police coroner that billy died of drowning not by violence even though he had bruises on his neck and shoulders,0
i also did n't want to see someone simply doing classic lucy routines,0
great performances of the 2 lead actresses make this movie,0
this movie just pulls you so deeply into the two main characters,0
you must also be broad minded to believe in her brilliant lip reading and how some of the action falls into place,0
the point is that annakin died converted to the light side again and that is what the meaning of the helmet removal scene was about,0
this film is really a work of art,1
as a result of the violence and stupidity on display here i thought i was in for a pretty good time,1
it 'll be good,1
while the plot about compassion abuse and the power of love to heal all wounds is often powerful and moving it loses its way through the fault of continuity and menno meyjes' scrambling screenplay,0
a kingdom whose king is about to die has said king unleash a competition on his several sons to see who can retrieve a ruby first to be king whilst a trio of witches want the star to carve up and use to keep them young,0
the acting is mediocre the storyline dull it ca n t stand if it is not even a joke,1
she has not one ounce to say or think about,1
her mother in fact is so concerned with her getting the girl her whole life,1
even when i watched it over twice i was not able to keep my eyes open for a long time,1
again all in all this is a very entertaining and interesting crime film,1
but i wouldn't call michael wilder an actor i would call him a filmmaker,1
but the story is great,0
you might be interested because this documentary has some of his best images of new yugatan in my personal collection the best of them coming as a surprise to mebr br there is also a very impressive set of photographs and music,1
the movie tries hard but at the end it fails miserablelybr br this movie should have been titled a movie,1
i definitely recommend it as a rental although some of the themes which might have seemed a bit edgy in 1989 now may seem tame which is a shame considering that contemporary edginess is often just used as a necessary marketing tool sort of like clamoring just to get noticed,0
viewers really cared deeply for the crew,0
although the plot could have been developed and some of the action might just have worked for the show if it were a little slower i will say that for once i didn't like the way that they changed jody lester a little bit and his character a lot i guess that was intentional but he should nadie is a bit too stupid for that and i ca not remember a scene where she says the same thing over and above the characters talkingbr br now i must say that it didn't look like a movie it sounded good on tv and i am not a movie watchers i watched it on video so i ca nad,1
 and the ending,1
50 minutes of it that never gets boringbr br the soundtrack was pretty funny too and the characters were a real treat,1
it 's no epic but it 's plenty engaging and i was never bored,0
all in all this is a wonderful tv movie,1
you 'll never get enough of her voice and acting,1
hel yes,0
later on when tracy is reported missing in action tone and george marry,0
what it does is conveys numerous heartwarming themes that hit closest to home especially the death of innocence on the battlefield and the horrors of war through the eyes of a child,0

it should be more apparent to the viewer that michael caine was the lead in this picture,1
ingenious paul recognizes that carla 's ability to read lips even from a considerable distance is more than the amusing parlor trick it first seems to bebr br from there a caper develops,0
br br when we first meet the two boys there are no signs they seem like little girls,1
br br mb,0
he was just a perfect actor,1
ever since the first time i saw it it 's depth intensity special effects and moving story have overwhelmed me,0
in the film you see an old man from the 1920'ssession gordon and pamela'reilly have been trying a house on a desert,1
never the less the effects like the ghosts are really good,0
you 'll wind up missing half the glorious alberta cinematography by william daniels,0
there are good actors here but we can always find a couple of guys who can play the good guys,1
this is not something new but the only reason it is on tv is for a tv movie,1
br br both movies end with the same image a closeup of a ringing bell,0
keep your eyes peeled for a memorable technically astonishing assassination that will make your jaw dropbr br the compositions are stunning,0
just do not put a lot of money into this movie,1
the princes are n't that big an issue as they are constantly trying to kill each other and just as in pirates of the caribbean never has death been so funny,0
it 'll change his mindbritt is a little more subtle here and the story is more focused on his friendship rather than his relationships with friends,1
now i 'd be the first to hail lars von trier a genius just off the back of his films breaking the waves and dancer in the dark but this is stupid the fact that europa has gone unnoticed by film experts for so long is a crime against cinema whilst overrated rubbish like crouching tiger hidden dragon and life is beautiful clean up at the academy awards europa has been hidden away absent form video stores and any british tv channels,0
the acting is good but not particularly good,1
hey there 'll be another one like it for sure,1
and it is one you just hope will find it somewhere else in your home,1
incidentally steven spielberg cast the actress who played the chief angel as the elderly wife of the eponymous private in saving private ryan half a century later an act that speaks volumes for his cinematic literacy,0
'ned kelly' is a wonderfully made australian film honouring a true australian hero,0
johnson'scared the hell away from him as the killer is his old flame and the other two don't do that well with anyone,1
you do n't want to miss it,0
this is more like a 1990s ford performance bored and looking above the film itself,0
and there is no point to seeing the movie when you know it 'll ruin the story of the two protagonists,1
on the opposite side of town the sheriff is a good guy but not in the usual 'this is bad but i still have a lot of friends in my town and maybe my neighbors wo nn't come back to town,1
i was very pleasantly surprised by this heartwarming and magical gem,0
we just have a script full of plot and the actors really didn't take much to care for any of these issues nor did they try to explain anything to the story,1
how could i possibly pass up the chance to see orlando bloom and heath ledger together,0
thats itbr br and the endingbr br if the film does have any redeeming features i 'da tell you what but it had none,1
she also looks good and i didn't care how much her hair was done in the movie,1

jabba a truly disgusting blob of bloated flesh who speaks in his own language not only makes a great villain but a memorable one too,0
his description of his sexual relations with the men of the tribe was way ahead of its time in the early 60 's but his honesty and openness about it were welcome,0
in short the film is well enchanting,0
along the same lines andrew kavala plays the father of the characters,1
this film is not about the obvious,0
their are many reasons the fact that it 's set in new york which truly sets the tone the fantastic soundtrack the appealing star turns from ben gazzara and the late john ritter who is superb,0
that 'll only take her two minutes of screen time,1
there're not many films that can do it justice,1
but that leads to the other problem in that the lack of any depth or background to characters other than the titular hero leaves the events of the story with zero impact,0
the whole thing just goes out to hell where a guy goes and gets his friend killed,1
i recommend this movie for anyone who 's into thrillers it will not disappoint you,0
this is the first i have seen deniro using tenderness rather than toughness to sell a character and i really like it,0
one scene is one that makes you laugh at the stupidity in the film,1
it 's more along the lines of dramedy than comedy,0
again muck like the element of crime the film ends with our hero unable to wake up from his nightmare state left in this terrible place with only the continuing narration of von sydow to seal his fate,0
writers writers of movies and a bunch of people who have absolutely no respect for history or politics,1
the terrain looks like an interior tribal reservation of no particular importance to the coastal fleshpots where industry dwells,0
this was a waste and a waste more and they wasted money on a really poor sequel to a much much worse sequel to an awful one,1
all in all 810,0
however its deception lies in the complexity of its is it real or is it imaginary premise,0
this movie is a waste,1
the costumes worn by the actors are beautiful and the town in which the novela takes place is beautiful,0
in fact i think it is the third best film in the 6part saga,0
remember when you had a bunch of young people doing stupid acts and the cops had to figure out who the bad guys were so that they were not the bad guys,1
br br the outstanding script more than matches the imaginative set design with dialogue that sounds so immediate that is does n't feel like it was written or performed for the screen,0
maybe she would give it a shot,1
whoever was responsible made this moviebr br and no matter how many times i watch this movie i always make the same comment one the main character is so stupid and i hate that br br i will not get into this one i guess this is an overrated film for many but not here,1
um no,1
director michael powell once stated that this was his favorite movie and it is mine as well,0
it 's definitely not as crude and edgy as south park but does bring some of the same bash everyone feel to it,0
however here is proof that long before she took home an oscar for mildred pierce crawford was a star in the true sense of the word a terrific actress with the charisma to carry a picture all by herselfbr br score eight out of ten,0
stewart is of course remembered by many as george bailey from frank capra 's it 's a wonderful life so it 's easy to find parallels between the two films,0

some of lance leon'sipling'scott smithee and larry crenna are pretty much in the same movie together and so are everyone else for the entire movie,1
my only gripes are as follows,0
you can only marvel at the perceptions inherent in the characterisation of the two ageing performers,0
the cast the sequencing the effects everything,0
you could stage a version of charles dickens' a christmas carol with sock puppets and i 'll probably watch it,0
among others the narrations made by the chorus give a particular atmosphere that makes us party of the artistic rendition,0
her character was believable but i think this could be a better movie,1

surely a lot of it makes sense to him it would make sense but if you do this to a kid it 'll make no logical conclusions whatsoever,1
br br i loved this film,0
i am looking forward to view again but it is n't available,0
it was on once in 1972 i was only 9 but nothing since then even compared to it,0
you know the people in the movie are in for it when kingsized hailstones fall from a clear blue sky,0
the music in the movie is awesome and you do n not need a brain or anything to enjoy it it is not as fun as the music of other movies which isn't necessarily the case,1
br br there is nothing original or original in the film for that matter,1
fairly typical of the genre and one that isn't the usual hartley type of horror,1
the movie've been on in the past since it was released in 2003 so i had a feeling for this,1
the most memorable moment for me in the movie is in the first of the three main scenes between the two main characters,1
not very funny or entertaining the worst acting i will never see even in a movie,1
otherwise stay away,0
sure i may have known what was going to happen throughout most of the film but it makes you forget that,0
not to have the whole family laughing would have had me groggily shakingbr br the ending is a little overblown but it is nadir,1
i am partial to john goodman 's voice but the rest of the team certainly were on par with john,0
it is a movie that would n't linger so long in the memory if it were n't for the little moments provided by the excellent cast colleen camp 's simultaneously shouting orders at john ritter and her dog blaine novak unleashing all that hair from under his hat and especially the moment dorothy stratten falls for john ritter and says how,0

everything about it makes it a lot hotter,1

besides do n't all aussies love an underdog,0
that'scrambled over a few times is one of the least impressive moments about any horror film i have seen in yearsbrbr the movie has one of the most boring deaths everbrained but no one has ever done thatbrickles from the zombies and that is the only explanation i can think to why this movie does how its the story'scramble around around a dead body for a whilebr br this just might be the worst horror movie i have ever seen and certainly the worst i can think i will have to go in and watch one more moviebr br 310,1
and for the most part the movie works well,1
however it has some serious weaknesses,1
in this movie the indian values are stated very well,0
now that 'll do,1
and the sound design is also impeccable the way the sound mutes at vital points was a decision way ahead of its timebr br this is a true classic that can restore anyone 's faith in cinema under appreciated on its initial release and by today 's audiences but one of my all time favourites which is why i give this film a 1010 in a word beautiful,0

do nate was not given the opportunity to express his feelings and feelings before the movie went to a full on commercialbr br the last scene after the commercial ends was one of two in which the three actors who were in the beginning were totally wasted because of the dramatic situation,1

when they both have a fight afterwards i believe deanna says why do you keep coming back,0
first and most important part of the movie are the girls,1
br br what you 're seeing by all accounts in show people is the real davies a gifted comedienne a superb mimic and a generous good hearted person,0

could any one please tell me when it will come on again,0
on the other side there the parents who are the pendant to the two girls,0

judging rotj because a minor character died is a bit much i think secondly many fans did not like yoda dying,0
i thought this film was a strange insight into the mind of a none sleeper and what hisher mind may be going through in the hours that they spend awake when the rest of the world around them is asleepit was an interesting film and a good part was played by dom i believe that even though this film you cannot buy anywhere you must see it if you ever get the chance because it will really make you think about those people around us that cannot sleep and have to suffer night after night of not been able to sleep or only get about 1 hour of sleep every night so overall it was an interesting film of good substance,0
however you should take heed that this film will go on for 210 minutes,0

this film has one flawbr br 1,1
now i know what a bad actor the director is and the audience is a very good one,1

before you start thinking there is no real storyline in the entire damn movie you think its about that girl who kills a dude and then later gets a job at an electronics store which is totally absurd and a totally weird concept when the concept is supposed to have some nice visuals but that'seems to be just a silly one and the rest of the movie just has a total lack of action which is really boring,1
spoon 'ed me into an evil grin on my cheek,1
unintentionality was involved and they would nada,1
you feel the pain of being hart broken in the end br br buti need also to add a negative spin to this comment i do n't know if the story is not somehow showed to give the feeling that these relations are sick only in form but not in content,0

and while he does have one of the last shots in the film he just is shown as a silent tyrant observing the burning of the bodies of the americans and their alliesbr br despite several poor choices in the casting of this television movie it is the best film in showing the man who was a leading bogeyman to american policy makers,0
much like all his'reanimator movies of that era the main character is so animated that you 'get dizzying visuals every step on,1
so if you 'd like to complain about objectionable context save your breath,0
the movie is shot with a very close attention in the distance of the actors for most part giving the viewer time to think about the filmbras an adult this is not a realistic portrayal,1

br br there 's also desi talking about buying rko in 1953 during lucy 's redscare incident even though rko did not hit the market until 1957 these changes well could have been for dramatic license and the film does work at conveying the main facts but would it have hurt them to show a bit more respect to oppenheimer and asher two vital figures in i love lucy history,0

over one christmas on a rare week when channel 4 in the uk showed a week of hong kong movies zu warriors was so gripping for a very young viewer and his brother and so memorable that it 's been etched into the memory of the now grown up sprog br br in fact i think the original zu warriors is one of the earliest films i saw as a kid that i can clearly recall the story line and action scenes from,0

courtney lawrence is terrific and plays his role well,1
and it all makes perfect sense when you consider the situation after the big explosion,1

movie with the story is as important as the script,1

this is a terrible excuse for a movie,1
if she had actually been the victim i 'll take no pleasure no questions no excuses,1
ends on a cliffhanger and following the deaths of lead actors ernst hugo jregrd and kirsten rolffes you wonder how theyre ever going to be able making part iii but i hope von trier will give it a shot,0
this film is a film that i have been fortunate to witness as a teenager and as a young man and womanbr br this film makes the viewer and the audience 'feel like adults at this moment in history not kids and it gives the viewer more insight into their own minds and how they must try to fight back or accept that they don't belong in such a situation,1
good acting all around with something positive taking place in the lives of some pretty good people,0
it was a great discussion starter in my class,0
i did n't have many expectation going into the film but i thought it was fantastic,0
but a lot of the characters were pretty annoying and very annoying as did the director and screenwriter in the script,1
what happens,1
incidentally director brahm 's involvement here proves no mere coincidence since the narrative incorporates elements from two horror titles he had previously helmed ie,0
peter is all grown up and is now the puppet master,0
if you haven't read or seen this before you will feel embarrassed for it,1
brenda bleeder is as innocent as she can and it works in the movie,1
i hope the plots will get deeper and then special effects can take a backseat,0
now admittedly i'm no ardent student of the genre,0
it'scars that many have been made since the first one and i don't know how many but i know they were made because people liked it,1
norman maclean is the older of the two brothers and he is set on the path of education,0
but there is a good reason why the movie is called a remake of a classic,1
not only does she get her ass cut off in cold comfort by gil the killer is also very close in his body to the same girl he killed,1
br br while some of you might like this movie the others don't,1
so what 'll happen nextbrace yourself with one of the many fantastic and memorable films of this decade,1
there were three or more of those in all,1
and as always the film is a little too dark and gritty for most of the cast'sthis will have no impact on them either,1
the choti ie,0
this movie is nothing more than another hollywood version of the same movie played back to us by a bunch of kids who had an affair together,1
riff randle get everyone tickets for the ramones show and this movie peaks with a take over of the school led my riff randle the ramones,0
but that 'll only get you so used to the original movie,1
however this was a moving and enjoyable film but certainly not a great one,0
one of my allstars and is an absolute gem in my opinion,1
edward g robinson makes a great choice as his partner in the film and he brings the real emotion he is good as always,1
well i really enjoyed this movie,1
new york has never looked so good,0
monroe '68 as the title implies does just fine in this film and it has a couple nice moments with its supporting cast,1
also i'm used to seeing matthau act that way in other movies but not to george burns,0
but this was the first film i saw that actually showed us what life is allabout,1
then get back to me without coming across as unlikable,0
setting his story in a modern context this works very well,1
5 bucks says the character he plays in this film is what he 's really like in real life,0
so i think this film should be viewed on one end,1
for the life of me i cannot remember what it was up against but one thing i can say it was one of the best movies i have ever seen,0
that elusive santa is of course the angelic max who pops up now and again throughout the story in a variety of guises to solve problems dispense advice tie up loose plot strandsand even share a musical duet with kathleen 's talented daughter socorro br br interested in having a copy write to me here iamaseal2com,0
the best is easily amrita rao,0
thanks in advance to any fans who have the low down on any of this in fact i 'd love to discuss it,0
my husband and i are wellread baptistsbr br i have heard a movie critic state that the pace of this movie is too slow,0
that scene is where the story is nigh on unbelievable,1
as i am exactly jodie foster 's age i related to this movie,0
it is to his everlasting credit that rather than sleepwalking through this oftportrayed role of scrooge he instead gave it a fresh interpretation that was in my opinion one of his finest performances ever,0
even this film is a work of art,1
answer quietly deadpan and with perfect timing as george burns does herebr br i know nothing of vaudeville but this remains a favourite film the two leads are hilarious the script funny the direction and pacing very fine,0
alfred molina and patrick mcgaw make an unusual comic duo definitely not stock types,0
he is a good actor but his character is also very annoying especially when he is trying so hard,1
every frame you'see a guy dressed as a vampire walking his way through a crowd and the film has the feeling it was shot on the location,1
spoiler alertbrutman wants us believe that he 'll be able to track down these terrorists on the run even if it is an empty plan,1
come to a conclusion that a person will not live up the hype that they are going to have but then the same thing can occur,1
the us was decent enough to pay mexico 15000000 for the southwest but mexico lost half of it 's territory,0
at least they had good performances by harvey gofilmer dennis rodriguez stanley tuccillo dario argento and edgar allenbrigitta is a real winner as the baddies while the good guys get to shine on paper too,1
but as far as we are all humans and have the same human nature we necessarily have common experiences and can understand each other,0
matthau burns were terrific in this film,0
what can i say i have grown up watching hum saath saath hain hum aapke hain koun and maine pyar kiya,0
still a nice addition to the series and one of the few great things in the entire series,1
it has a funny and touching theme where our hero is the type of person who is willing and dedicated to take risk so that he does nay do anything that puts this guy to hell,1
but he has been a jerk from birth,1
but the film is about a woman and husband who are torn between their own personal life and the duties to their children whom both will have to choose between,1
i said then and repeat now it was a charming funny and entertaining show wellacted with wonderful characterizationsbr br i recently saw on dvd four old episodes plus the reunion of 2000 with richard crenna kathy nolan and tony martinez,0
since then i have acquired both the video and soundtrack and have to say that after several viewings i am still very impressed with the underlying character of this film,0
this show has very little in the way of continuity or logic and it is not particularly clever and interesting in the end so why bother,1
but i must say whoever did the research on australian aboriginal belief systems should get an a plus,0
would nada,1
walter brennan does basically the same role he did in red river years earlier,0
the story is interesting but it 's highly unlikely that some cocktail waitress will get an important job in the government just because she saved some big shot 's life,0
nonetheless when your not having a goodtime you 'll get an amazing experience,1
br br overall it was funny romantic the special effects were n't totally frequent but when they were they were great the cameos from ricky gervais and peter o'toole were also wellplaced,0
this is a great action film,1
meanwhile rene a young naive french woman also takes an immediate liking to jeff but only gets insulting brush offs in return,0
what it lacks is the atmosphere and its intensity it is so intense it 'll make your head explodebr br it really is not for the horror fan and certainly not one for a serious film maker,1
peter bogdanovich is obviously in love with all the women in his picturehe reveres themyet audrey hepburn is put a notch above the others because after all she 's the princess bogdanovich probably fell in love with at the movies 30 years prior,0
if you look to a show for drama and character development this is the one for you it focuses more on that then mobile suit battle,0
films by roman roberstein and theodor walsh this one is pretty rarebritton a young aspiring artist on a trip with his girlfriend jennifer lange and a friend of their and he is asked how he can get into the world without going over drugs and prostitution,1
he deploys his talents as an illusionist and as a brilliant mimic to avenge himself upon rinaldi and others who thwart his plans for recognition as a performer and a designerbr br price is pretty much the whole show here and gives a well judged star turn as a wronged man whose predicament earns audience sympathythe rest of the cast are competent if colourless and the weight of the whole venture falls on price who carries the burden with ease br br good solid b movie melodrama this is a crime movie rather than a horror picture and is enjoyable providing you do n't expect a masterpiece shot in black and white it is low on gore and is best seen as melodrama and enjoyed for the presence of its star giving an idiosyncratic performance,0
it 's told from a decidedly female perspective but you need n't fear that it 's a saccharine 'chick flick'br br the story is an interesting one livened with humour at times although the central character 's struggles are paramount,0
most of it is predictablebr br my guess is that director danielle is hoping to cash in with a dvd with his film because she thinks he 'll cash in more than he already has,1
although it was a pretty good little thriller i found the story and pace to a bit weak in fact,1
some kid becomes the one and in the end has almost no relevance to a yokai war that makes no sense whatsoever anyway,0
i watched this movie alongwith my complete family of nine,0
during wwii british peter carter 's plane is shot down in combat but he survives,0
simultaneously i was amazed to see that some films are actually better because there are so many morebr br i would be very careful in recommending this movie to anyone who is interested in the art of storytelling because its so rare and very entertaining,1
they also had to be prepared to go through some major troubles,1
to make it worse this movie is very badly cast,0
for anyone who loves fantasy fiction this movie is for you,0
in any case mary is the type that i can identify with in many aspects of life,1
when i finished watching this movie it left me so emotionally drained that i decided to watch this movie again,0
this movie is nothing but a low budget hollywood ripoff of the worst movies of all of cinema,1
before it 's over shemp 's trusty little shovel is employed to great effect,0
it has absolutely nothing to recommend here,1
the twists keep on coming and comingbr br the caf scenes work best with the handheld cams to show what it 's really like in there,0
think pierce brosnan and you think suave dapper intelligent james bond,0
who done it,0
too many people were laughing and crying over this one,1
it was hard to suspend such belief in the amati girls,0
my guess is that it tried to send a message of some sort but that just got wasted on mebr br what i felt that is basically this is a mediocre movie with nice special effects,0
when she finds out that he has just gotten out of prison carla initially wants nothing to do with paul but has a change of heart and hires him on,0
overall the movie is great for fans of silent movies,1
nanavati did a great job putting this short together,0
skagway 's boss is a socalled law man named gannon who reminds one of the real boss of skagway in the gold rush jefferson soapy smith and judge roy bean,0
on the way he gets hassled by a local sheriff in alaska whom he hassles back,0
subbed in for her part kurt rudd takes her on an amazing ride from the inside out of the story that're about a woman who 'll do any thing to get out that're her life,1
this film is in short a cinematic masterpiece,0
th,0
the film is very funny and it really shows the love gap of a family,1
made when she was just 27 this lesserknown version of crawford will probably be unrecognizable to those more familiar with her later work,0
after seeing this movie with a friend for the last time the next morning and immediately thinking i had seen it i decided to purchase the dvd and get it,1
one does not understand all but one feels the power of the film to every second every picture,0
the myriad locations vivid colors and quickwitted humor provide great entertainment,0
our story begins with us being taught about britilians in germania during the last days after the civil wars of the 1920'seventies and 1930'ss the general of course is a little too young,1
let''si get a real kick from those with the guts not to allow them the opportunity to insult the characters or show them the truth,1
all of page one 's commentators wrote eloquently as almost so as the dialog is in this movie,0
an old friend has a big talk of how he has made an appearance to his friend in his office just like she had to see him,1
the characters are very clearly drawn,0
they make a cute couple and their onscreen chemistry reminds me of or br br some points that i observedfew of the elements if u notice carefully amrita rao looks so good because shes always wearing traditional dresses,0
however if you haven't yet seen his work go check this one out and be prepared to appreciate a much better and more rewarding work,1
i laughed cried and got angry,0
john caine and barbara stanwyne are good but there is a lacklustre performance and one ca nadley that does nadly fall flat with the film'spoilers belowbrilliance has something to say about the rise and evolution of the united kingdom in todaysthe film is a little weak in some parts and has the feel of a poorly produced film which is disappointing for me in my viewas well there are moments from the film that look more real and real than anything else that were churning out on the set and that were just too much for me to bear at allhow can someone even claim,1
but the final hour is arguably the best piece of the entire saga where luke finally comes face to face with darth vader the most recognizable villain in movie historybr br return of the jedi did so many things right that people tend to overlook it presented an incredible conclusion to the darth vader storyline an exciting opening at jabba 's palace a masterful performance of ian mcdiarmid as the emperor luke finally coming into his own the resolution of solo and leia 's romance and the extremely powerful final moments on the endor moonbr br yes there are slight annoyances,0
the film looks like an amateurish attempt at a comedy,1
i had the pleasure of seeing this film at the rhode island international film festival and was very impressed,0
the characters were not only lively but alive mirroring real every day life and strife within a family,0
the sexy hot female dancer consuela harris would put ann miller and gyspy rose lee to shamebr br adding further info popular blues singer of the 20 's and 30 's cora green is the focus of the film she 's mandy a good hard working woman with a no good man who takes her money and spend it on other women,0
there is a lot of action in the scenes building up to the rebellion 's final confrontation with the emperor,0
they are n't your typical charming young yuppie couple as generally depicted in on screen romances but an ordinary working class middle aged pair with pretty down to earth strugglesbr br i wo n't give the ending away but it 's a lovely heartwarming romance and a personal look into the troubling issue of adult illiteracy albeit from the perspective of a fictional character,0
the magical powers were frighteningly realistic,0
she does a little bit but does not give any hint of her past that has ever been discussed on the show i felt the writing of the storyline was poorly written and did not work in creating that suspense that the first season had,1
it does n't happen however and the film does work because the luzhin turturro creates is impeccably honest and truetolife,0
like most movies of the day it takes you to a place you don't want to go,1
i do n't mind jumping on platforms in third person adventures,0
lowkey is a movie that you feel compelled to be,1
after seeing it i'm sure it had some effect on me through the process,0
when one has no other choice the movie is so bad that one ca not even stand watching it,1
br br i do nod,1
set in the south during the first half of the 20th century the color purple is a film so strong that it made me cry at the end,0
even though the production code mentions not to use the word'sexually violent sex scenes only violence and profanity but they even use the word 'blood in the streets violence a lot this movie wasn't scary at least not with the profilers who are really scary right,1
this allows von trier and his three cinematographers to pay with the conventions of time and imagery there are many scenes in europa when a character in the background who is in black and white will interact with a person in the foreground who will be colour von trier is trying to show us how much precedence the coloured item or person has over the plot for instance it 's no surprise that the first shot of leopold kessler is in colour since he is the only character who 's actions have superiority over the film,0
move on,1
one of my friends recommended a sequel and i went into it expecting another big disappointment,1
the families thee tradition the love and respect,0
and it 'll be worth it the first time you see the movie,1
in this film he played the weak brother and was completely overshadowed by joan crawford and the dynamic newcomer clark gable maybe that was why he never became a starbr br highly recommended,0
jean arthur is great as calamity jane nobody that i know played it better than her,0
oh god you devil and going in style,0
in this one of the better of his films robert mickiewicz'swimmers of the river and his brother ray millander'swimmers from hell also offer some impressive moments,1
the music is quite catchy and it 'll just be that,1
his face alternately shows his cheerful courage and also at times his weariness in the face of intolerable circumstances,0
then the main character gets a new identity as david branagh 'the man after all he is a man who can't act anymore,1
the story is not about being gay though it 's about love and sex that do n't conform to social norms and therefore must be removed through violence and hate,0
michael powell wrote directed and produced this astonishing movie which is a real tourdeforce,0
the bitter and hopeless end of the story is also very realistic,0
why she does it,1
and andie again is doing superb job,0
this is an odd film that works an impressive effort for writerdirector shepard,0
the characters who make the movie were great in the first part as well,1
but that just adds to the power this film has,0
his portrayal of a man who makes it through a gruff job as a streetwise man but in love with a woman with a heart full of lies is superb,1
never change a winning team is exactly what writer crane wilbur must have thought when he penned down price 's character don gallico another tormented soul besieged by fate and out for vengeance against those who wronged him,0
no not funnybr br unlike the sleazy salacious and violent trash on tv now that is so undermining our values the real mccoys entertained with decent values and fine human beings,0
even the ending was a bit confusing as the police force was being hunted down at an abandoned prison camp,1
she wasn't going to help her family get into a good shape,1
great stuff bbc a triumph of sense over sexappeal,0
i know the feeling of being sucked into something dangerous where you feel helpless but to do things that you do not want to dobr br another user commented on how this movie was silly and implausible but i beg to differ,0
well it 'll soon be here,1
when there is a falling star tristan promises to retrieve it for a girl he is infatuated with,0
far from the typical horror film the movie has a good story and overall a solid score from holland and kubrickbrilliam,1
i also enjoyed the plot as a whole,0
the actors could have done a better performance,1
this program is a lot of fun and the title song is so catchy i ca n't get it out of my head,0
brilliant idea for an actioner,1
but i have been thinking of these same movies over andover and thought this film was so terrible i just watched it one time i liked it i 'll tell ya later but i'm not a movie buff the acting was so bland the direction so flat and the whole script was bad i guess that you cant complain too bad there is some sort that could go in for a good movie about women in the 60'ss but they got worse with the 80'ss i cant tell why but at some point i found out that they could do the same with the next 20oddodd years or so there is nothing better to do in the world,1
true no,1
the scene that really bothered the film maker was when they try and shoot it,1
if so it should be deleted i wonder why it bothered me to watch the movie,1
we never see them interact,1
it 's like the modern peter pan simply amazingbr br i surely would buy a copy of this the moment it hit the marketbr br this movie is really a double must see one,0
there are some very interesting sequences in the film where the two lead characters get very lost and the film never ends so be sure you check it for yourselfbr br if this is your first film you'should give this a shot and go see the movie anyway as you will probably have a better impression of why it is entertaining than anything else,1
do n we need a great deal of plot to make this a movie worth watching,1
shortly after this movie was made i heard my friends and acquaintances tell a me and them how they should watch it and it 'll blow up and blow up again and that 'll bring them back together,1
the engagement of the dishwashers,0
it 'll make you laugh and you 'll cry but if you do it 'll make you cry harderbr br the script is very good i feel it was the director''shirly kiss and the lamb which was great,1
this film starts out like a run of the mill western but gets more complex as it goes along,0
the film looks like a parody on how the west was portrayed on the bigscreen but the story and performances are great,1
marion is eager young hopeful who arrives in hollywood like so many others looking for that big break,0
i am not a buddhist,0
in the entire movie there are basically 4 or 5 sequences where shahid amrita are together or shown to be together,0
plot and dialogue have many predictable elements and the fairytale quality may be too saccharine for some audiences,0
there will always seem to be those whose careers depend in the film as best as those whose careers depend in the film 'empire themselves but unfortunately we need to look to them on their performance in film for guidance when it will most ultimately determine their livesbr,1
if someone asked me what movie was best i would just write the names of the worst,1
the story is also very clever especially the scenes at the beginning when rochel is telling henry that he is a jew and is not that jew it is really sad what is happening to rochel but he is actually a gideon because he is an antichrist,1
they could have taken something out and spent some time trying different things,1
she literally shines in this movie,0
so the main storyline of the movie is basically just the samebr br the movie was shot in texas while at one time i was working in the movie theater,1
all the plot holes are gone,1
for the record i have seen all the longer poirotsuchet films,0
this movie has to win over some of its main fans because the main fans are nigh on dead serious,1
this movie is also from the makers of hum saath saath hain and hum apke hain kon,0
for all we know he died in the hospital,0
they had to have the most amazing story as it turns out,1
the acting in this movie is truly awful and the storyline was very thin and unoriginal at the same points,1
especially of note was the way that the movie showed the two male children and how he used them to get what he wanted when he wanted it was very much a family movie rather than just a drama drama which is supposed by most to represent a family but unfortunately it did n've the message it wants,1
andie macdowell once again thrown by the surrounds of the british is absolutely charming as the head mistress of a prestigious school who becomes involved with a younger man,0
will this ever hit north america,0
of course it 'll always be a part of me to find this to truly be his best film,1
the movie is very personal and worth watching twice,0
it was a great movie,1
john turturro is excellent as the tortured genius luzhin and brilliantly portrays the character 's manic affectations such as his strange dancing,0
if this did have any connection with the film it is not,1
next the two go up into the attic where they find a pair of naked women and they find out that the two are the victims are partofit,1
it 'll get a bit dull at times but for a lot more it'stinks and the film 'll be much more entertaining to watch than it is to watch the film,1
basically its like a real life movie the kind of movie where real people try not make mistakes and actually have a successful life,1
this film is one of the better horror films i've seen in a long very long time as i haven't been exposed to so much slasher cinema at that age,1
ega generation:'blackbird 2 has been a very satisfying remake i haven't seen before so if you want a good one watch blackbird or if only for a couple minutes,1
bonnie jordan is the most popular girl there especially when she suggests that everyone go swimming in their underwear,0
one of the worst acting outta these actors,1
but more is revealed in the bonus features of how some of the producers wanted to make this film for international audiences with some of their stars we might not have heard of,0
the whole time i watched it in its entirety it started to get annoying,1
jacques audiard is not a newcomer yet,0
petunia is just so bad that in this version we do get to see a couple of scenes that are not exactly interesting and annoying but are still quite memorable for fansof the series,1
sure i agree the movie is very slow paced and the story of karen'spoon is pretty slow but there is a sense that the film was just about all about her and didn't really focus on how she really felt about her character,1
the acting is superb along with the fine audio soundtrack which i purchased because it was so moving,0
jj 'goes to meet with a man named david gilbrad,1
but it is disarming in its gentle reminders of the horrors of war the numerous casualties both military and civilian the need to go on when faced with death,0
i am haunted by waters,0
just go in and have a good time,0
it dosent really say much or do much but it is an awesome movie to watch because of how stupid it is,0
the talkshow icon oprah winfrey is brilliant as a strongwilled sofiabr br warning,0
to al fountain in box of moonlight' you realize what an incredible range turturro has as an actor and what a remarkable artist he truly isbr br as natalia emily watson is excellent as well turning in a fairly reserved performance through which she develops and presents her character quite nicely,0
but i think all that the audience should be able to tell about this is the fact that some parts of it can actually be enjoyed at least a few times,1
you get to know the characters quickly and experience their ups and downs,0
every movie has a unique moment and there are only 5 movies in the world where this is the greatest film of all time,1
in northeastern of brazil the father of the twelve years old illiterate maria sells his daughter to the middle man of a prostitution organization tadeu to be employed as a housemaid and have a better life,0
augmented by scott 's voice a ponderous growl the effect is galvanizing much like marlon brando 's first scene in apocalypse now,0
i picked this one up on a whim from the library and was very pleasantly surprised,0
for some true actorsactresses race films were the only type of films they could get work especially if they did n't want to play hollywood stereotypes so i think you 'll be able to spot the true actorsactresses from the nightclub performers,0
the plot line could probably have gone another direction but it'res the way it is executed and the acting is good,1
if you love suspense andor action you should check this off,1
i say this because he found someone who did n't look a single bit like anne marie fahey herself,0
we are taken into the world of ned his best friend joe byrne and the other members of the kelly gang as the film explains and perhaps justifies ned 's actionsbr br there is an exceptional cast present who all give stellar performances which brings the film to life,0
the cinematography is one of those qualities,0
worst part of the film is the whole movie when the two people start fighting the baddies have no idea whats on screen that a movie would actually have it look like,1
one led by connie gilchrist and chubby johnson want to build a decent town,0
you must have watched this before watching the film as i'm sure you were in the same situation,1
the film is a great example as a study in bad writing,1
i think i have yet to see a more selfabsorbed oblivious selfrighteous character on screen,0
it was a very well done and suspensefilled film that i would have never seen again after seeing the first part which was the original and i would think it would be great for a sequel,1
also the dangerous stunts make the viewer hold hisher breath as the film has one fast car vs pedicab chase sequence and various dangerous looking jumps and twisting bodies flying through the air and crushing with force to the hard destination,0
italias a woman from la is a beautiful woman in her mid to mid 20 to early 21st soprano and a pretty woman in her late 70 and 80'ssixties who caunhing her hair every morning to the side with her eyes wide open and the eyes of a beautiful young man with the look on her face the same look on both eyes that you see in a girl ',1
love is overwhelming in all it 's manifestations gorgeous absolutely gorgeous tudor chirila maria popistasu and ioana barbu one truly dramatic story about love in all it 's shapes a story about the undecipherable ways of young hearts about life and lost innocence all directed by the skillful eye of tudor giurgiu,0
in my view that it is an excellent film and one of my favourite films,1
and there are only some moments of humour to be seen at allbrilliant,1
odd that mgm never teamed them up in a talkie,0
this is a bad film for sure,1
it 's god a good design and makes a nice wreckbr br the setting is on a danish island or peninsula i ca n't remember,0
neil simon 'the last blackbird'' 'is an early example of a movie that tries hard and succeeds brilliantly in presenting the struggles and sacrifices which are required to survive in this country,1
both are good if mediocre films but in their respective respects they lack the impact that the first two films hadbrilliance or grace,1
this has to have to have been a great script great acting great direction great direction great music beautiful cinematographic shots that you will remember forever,1
yes you will not find him playing basketball and scoring every point on a dunk like you saw shahrukh in ddlj he does come across as very believable as a person who holds true to his values,0
a french spirit comes to get him but he refuses,0
also there was no sex to keep this film in my mind even though i had seen it three other timebr br the acting was ok the music score was good and the direction was very good,1
subsequent series and the next one of the series are a complete messbr br if you can forgive the fact that the writers were so desperate for a cheap pg rated movie then this is for all you,1
alicia seems mature and violent smoking cigarettes and talking roughly,0
this movie brings back many memories of the classic cinema of old where actors did n't have to take their clothes off to make viewers watch their filmbr br firstly i think the main plus point of this movie is the amazing chemistry between shahid and amrita it is definitely the making of the filmbr br i have seen lots of comments regarding the film being sickly sweet and overly slushy,0
and there they should say how they find together,0
instead they were playing with a set design that looks like something from a 1930'scary film with a bad soundtrack and with terrible camera direction,1
my wife and i both did n 'get it,1
i saw the movie oh god recently and loved it,0
no small feat considering those movies took years to be developedbr br cast was marvelous,0
at the approach of its centennial saura drew together an unprecedented wealth of talent from the spanish performing arts community to create this quintessential love song to their homeland,0
it 's good it 's different but a little to light hearted for my liking,0
john woo should have been called in to help out,1
the movie had a nice plot twist but this movie makes no connection with it except maybe the end where some people are killed by a car,1
this little diamond is finding its way into my dvd collection the moment it hits stores you can trust me on thisbr br simply wonderful,0
since he never did it again it was an obvious mistake,1
the characters have very realistic personalities and are placed in situations that parallel what we often face in real life,0
oh having almost 0 body fat does not hurt either,0
just to watch him walking through the hotel lobby in his speedo and boots gives the right impression about his character,0
most of the cast and a few good ones in the main roles but the last five minutes were totally ruined,1
it is a great horror film but just too much,1
the end could not be better,0

he has a very small budget and has one very very very limited budget and one very very very limited camera,1
rarely has you heard of or know someone with a brain like this,1
he has no idea how this man made it,1
a must see for any fan of action,0

his portrayal was the best i'saw him with in years,1

these race films are very historic they could have been lost forever many are lost maybe race films are n't the greatest example of cinema but even hollywood films did n't start out great in the beginning,0
is this a story of one family or something entirely different,1
plus the film is beautifully shot and the story told beautifullybr br the story is not as wellknown or understood as it is in europa or any modern country like france,1
you know that movie when i saw the opening credits on the box thinking hey there it''ll be a big big surprise for you,1
note to all the characters,1
it is the prefect fabletale with morals cute and scary sprites and 'monsters' but nevertheless heartwarming folk,0
alfred develops a sort of brotherly love for bernie while our young zeon pilot also falls for christinabr br war in the pocket proves that you do not need a sweeping epic tale about special individuals to make for a good war story,0

tom capano was a megalomanic an ubercontroller and a monster,0
director agust villaronga with an adaptation by antoni aloy and biel mesquida of blai bonet 's novel has created a film that traces the profound effects of war on the minds of children and how that exposure wrecks havoc on adult lives,0
the last scene is an insult to those who know me better to begin with brad pitt as the villain,1
return of the jedi is a fitting end to a saga that will stand the test of timebr br when the empire srtikes back ended with encasing of the lovable rouge han solo in carbonite to be delivered to jabba the hut and young luke reeling from the discovery of a terrible truth about his father we were left with the feeling that things were going from bad to worse,0
it 'll make you laugh,1
also this movie has a lot of gore and nudity,1
i suspect he is familiar with hitchcock 's foreign correspondent in which devious europeans also manipulate an american dupe and several welles movies that take delirious joy in technique as much as he does,0
and most of all the emotion is on the rendezvous,0
check,0
the problem is not so much the storyline as how the filmmakers manage to create the film as the characters and situations that we 'need to see and enjoy them in rather difficult predicaments they're not just there to express feelings in an objective manner the film is also a lot more about the human condition and how we cope with difficult situations and situations,1
it is a wonderful story of a man who gets up at 5am in his morning to visit his father and wife and the father is a poet at a schoolbr br as he is sleeping he notices that one of his friends has gotten up and then realizes that the poet has no ink,1
yeah that 'll make a good moviebrad pitt and tatum were excellent,1
it is kinda of an indie flick and was really nice to see especially with all of the mainstream movies that flood the movies at this time of the year,0
i was not happy to see him die either but it makes the movie more realistic,0
i totally recommend that you see this masterpiece,0
the two protagonists are so different,1
one quite funny scene has two derelicts watching the monster fly over the city says one oh it 's only gamera,0
if you want a funny movie that is nuff said then you have come to this one too easy,1
the first half is an exercise in the kind of nonsense a film like that could have turned into a decent movie but there've been other movies where i disagree with someone,1
it 'll not help them in any sense,1
the death scenes are elaborate and the most of the acting is good,0
ive seen all of john candy,1
it 's a colorful slasher movie,0
her face is huge in the back and leo 's is in the foregroundbr br one of the best uses of this is when the young boys kill the ravensteins on the train a scene shot in an almost political poster style with facial close ups,0
it 'es just a very simple and very funny film i'm sure there are hundreds of italian cinema films and it isn't too bad,1
very good filmbrigitte lombard is perfect as lombard and mia coates is absolutely stunning,1
brad pitt plays a very cool guy who tries and fails in trying to become a top lawyer but then again he was one of those guys who tried to become a really cool lawyer that went out of the way that he should,1
but there was something else that this movie seemed to have been aiming for i found it interesting,1
the story is basically a series of peaks with very little quiet moments,0
it also is a story that i will never understand,1
these slasher pics are past their sell by date but this one is good funbr br the valentine cards themselves are witty and well thought outbr br the film has one peach of a line he 's no angel when he in fact is angel,0
so what about this one,1
but here it is,1
you see it a couple times but you can clearly see it after about 10 minutes with most scenes being about 100 feet above the groundbrrrgh,1
given this film it was never supposed to be a moviebrigide is played as a young woman who is constantly wondering why her father left at that point her father was a great painter and her mother is a dancer and she finds herself wondering why she stayed with her father,1
the director 'edison'is a mustsee for anybody who wants something to laugh during a horror movie,1
yes they are the villains and it was a total surprise to discover that the filmmakers had already given a good scriptbr br it was obvious that the actors were used very well and it was nice to hear how they made a difference in this movie that you did not know at the beginning of the movie,1
almighty is nazarin and it'stinks and it is the sort where you would be in a mood to leave the room and have a beer,1
and of course there 'll be some sortof'spidella:'brilliant story,1
we have been told that the man who died will be found hanged but it looks like he was put dead by the monster,1
not one of them failed to follow the storyline and each person declared their love for this movie,0
some folks claim that this film is just another example that it is no longer a good film but i do nish to believe this,1
fantastical and realbr br br br those i spoke to afterward had the same impression i did,0
one other word for a movie,1
get out of your duds and try and be a star,1
what happens to him,1
it 's complex it 's sweet it 's cold it 's absorbing and it 's very long perhaps too long,0
scott bakula played a typical first time captain in deep space and his unpolished way of doing things was a refreshing change to the already know everything captains from before,0
br br the movie is a slow and tedious mess,1
i was a not bad horrorcomedy movie,0
then to give this movie a chance at one that it has so many good moments it has one of the best endings in tv history,1
the story is not as bad as some would have it to become but it gets more and funnier as the film goes onbrilliant,1
in the past decade and a half movies like this have been made that are a bit predictable but i'm sure this one will be one of the better ones to sit through because it was fun to see,1
exit the rivalbr br carla is virtually deaf without her hearing aid,0
remember that one schultz,0
so it 's got no budget who needs a budget when you got a script like this,0
chris confirms david 's dreams by showing him a strange looking black rock that david saw chris have in his dreams,0
it 'll probably not even be in the movie theaters for a long time,1
when those responsible are arrested they remain silent less they disturb the order of things,0
it 's very simple to qualify that movie a pure masterpiece,0
but he manages to get to the heart and heartstrings of many of the players,1
he has no idea what he'res doing,1
the last half of the film is a lot harder than the first half was however but still very entertaining,1
so he sets out to find a way of taking her to a place where she finds happiness which looks very much at odds and she has to deal with her own demons,1
br br but there was one weakness in the film,0
in fact they are acting out in their world a version of what they have witnessed in the adult world around them,0
rml could 've done without a curious subplot and a traditional 100 minutes would have been plenty,0
i thought it was one of the best sequels i have seen in a while,0
john ritter ineptly follows dorothy stratten and immediately falls in love with her,0
the fact i am giving it a 101 is because i do have a problem with the way ken masterson did the character of lila,1
how many times do you have all the characters come on to talk,1
the recreation of fly fishing served as the cohesive bond which homogenized the kindred spirits of the maclean brothers and to a lesser degree the father,0
and the audiovisual maze was sinister,0
this film is all too often forgotten about and forgotten about for good reasonsbruno almezzio was an intelligent director and writer who had no talent or talent value,1
but not only that this film is the firstbrat movie of the year and the bestbr br movie that it 'll bring you in the very futurebr br the best movie after the best movie after you've seen the best moviebr,1
even in the middle the main character doesn't know anything about the world or any of the characters of the first movie,1
sure this movie is not historically accurate but it is great entertainment,0
oh and i loved the creepy mask,0
the music is quite good,1
the way the story was written the writing and the acting was pretty bad,1
this is probably one of the better buddy comedies in a long time,0
this film has a special place in my heart as when i caught it the first time i was teaching adult literacy,0
this is not a film that should be watched by anyone unless they are a big hollywood movie fan,1
tragic and poignant,1
he 's james bond gone to seed in tootight garish clothes gold chains and an ugly haircut,0
who are you,0

willy 's nephewagent tries to get them to work togetherbr br a big hit in its day and it won george burns an oscar for best supporting actor,0
if you happen and want a film that goes beyond typical horror fare then you will love this one,1
certainly the best this year until now,0
this ending probably the only bit of conventional hollywood in the film is so incongruous with all that has come before that i at least wonder if it was n't forced in by some studio exec suddenly worried about the lack of a feelgood ending and its potential effect on the bottom linebr br now that according to the pundits we 've comfortably moved on to postindustrial capitalism the film also has a slightly nostalgic feel as though we needed the historical distance to really analyze what happened during that period,0
its one movie that was not only bad but so predictable and so boring that i ca hardly watch anymorebrained characters and bad acting make this movie an absolute chore to watch,1
so flippen is elected instead,0
check out the final scene featuring a group of college students and a reporter talking like they've been taken over the moon from something elsebr br a lot of good things were accomplished by the script,1
father of the pride is a pleasant surprise it is funny witty and features some great voice acting,0
the first part of each episode is very similar to all of the other episodes of season 5 but the overall feel of this show is different from last time,1
hi mary,1
gabbagabba hey,0
this is the sort of movie that should be used in all theaters and on dvd and just be a great movie,1
apart of that the ending is very sad,1
that've all changed,1
if stewart leaves gannon would take over the town,0
hollywood often gives us trash because not enough families go to see quality films,0
fly fishing,0
the whole thing just seemed as if it came out on dvd,1
some of mary'spoon and i love her,1
it was kind of like slowing down to look at a horrific traffic accident,0
the film is about what we perceive as real and what is real and how the two can be so difficult to distinguish from one another,0
even so does she have an accent,0
forget about her,1
those films do nsthe way it is,1
do i sense stereotype when it comes to them,0
the film begins with a montage of the german and american military aircraft being shown in the united kingdom during wwe,1
only occasionally is the music the sole focus of the film the vast majority of the time the music is set to various dances often flamenco but not always,0
an excellent star turn by marius goring who as the conductor 71 steals the film,0
the acting is poor and they made it seem like a movie,1
and the final shot of me doing the movie was so bad that i just knew it had got worse the closer i got i went,1
they are striking sets and represent the show perfectlybr br rick berman 'the overlord of the empire' as john logan so accurately put it and his counterpart brannon braga has hit the nail on the head exactly where they should have and in all the right places,0
more important is the emotional depth one feels for one of the victims,1
the boy returns happily to his fish none the wiserbr br the ending is amazing in both its irony and its technical complexity,0
the movie follows these characters as the each follow their own pathbr br there is no downside to this movie,0
so the movie is pretty much an adaptation but the music is awful,1
if you think of seeing this one for the shootings stay clear,0
people are expected to suffer,0
the emporer,0
it is a film you do care about and it makes you care,1
man who can do better,1
why,1
it was much more intimate than all thatbr br but like lord of the rings it was the well humanism of the film which sells the fantastical qualities,0
even though i found it confusing and not very compelling at all in its own way i still loved itbr br but even more important were a number of scenes where it was extremely obvious that the main cast wasn't even aware they were making their scenes even though there was already a plot being constructed before thembrbr so the movie was a good 8 10 from the abovebr br it was a pretty good 8 8 out 7 out 7 from the abovebrbr but even that doesn't help the movie,1
for example francoise lebrun was a former lover of eustache,0
as for the acting it'smacks too much of a remake and for a movie by a woman i never did understand how anyone could actually go from mike myers'shame on you mike myrs bryan who gave this film a 10 out of 10 stars just because it is her first film,1
if for some inexplicable reason you liked this film you'will probably love this movie too but please do not see it unless you have nagging nightmares,1
after watching it on dvd i have to say i regret that now,0
so when they announced a new star trek series i did not have high expectations,0
the story is really simple one man has a girlfriend and some money they do not have,1
the scene in which the two meet at a glossy hotel bar really is a bravura piece of acting skills,0
move over river queen this is the best river ride i 've taken in a while,0
this is one of the best of all the series,1
it isn't a very good movie at least not the original,1
betty is the best girl in the whole movie and i love her too but it was really painful to find her in this mess i really wanted her dead,1
so the best thing to do would be to leave the original alone as quirky and charming as it is,0
i think it would appeal to any labyrinth princess bride or 10th kingdom fan and yet it 's totally unique and stands up on it 's own,0
this is not a movie for children of any age,1
i could n't believe the character oprah played at the age of 35,0
i enjoyed the thrilling chase within the woods and i felt there was a lot of wellrealized emotion with this chapter,0
and so they shattered the fourth wall at the end by having the king and his nobles sing about the battle with the ogre and praise the efforts of puss in boots when they by rights should n't have even known about itbr br who cares,0
this is not a movie made to be enjoyed by the average person,1
if you like those types of things you should definitely check this one out i would've been thrilled,1
this was one of the most moving movies i have ever seen,0
one would have to be very jaded indeed not to be swept up into this gem of a film,0
robert duvall is a direct descendent of confederate general robert e lee according the imdbcom movie database,0
if howeveryou have a chance to see the original tv movie ghost story check it out,0
unfortunate since i wanted to hear from all three equally,0
bare bones tv drama has a story line that runs the entire length of the first six episodes of the show but with a twist that 'll leave some people wondering if it're just a bad thingbr br the only reason i went into this was to see what it would be a good idea to have a couple of female detectives kill off the guy they're chasingbrat that're all i wanted to say about the show,1
thomas leinhart played the same role of dr zomborg a man who had a fascination with people from outer spaces but he was a little late to his job,1
also the script is not convincing even for the main actors which is a shame,1
the movie would be best shown for an extra minute or two,1
the enthusiastic acting is pretty campy but that goes down well with the material and there 's a certain likability stemming from these characters but we totally despise ms togar and her hall monitor goonsbr br there 's no beating around the bush here when i say 'rock 'n' roll high school' is an intoxicating hoot of a rad time,0
reniem is another great character study about the rise and decline of the western industrial revolution in the late 1940 '40 '45 through to the early 1950'seventies,1
indeed davies and the already arrived haines become comedy stars,0
they aren't even on screen at the end because they got to eat a dead cat and the producers and director did that too and i wonder who made those choices because they are obviously stupid and i do n not like that sortof thing,1
thomas griffin also appears,1
as the two have an odd sex the audience gets annoyed and a little more blood is splattered on the screen,1
i 've got a fetish for german subs especially wrecks that can be dived upon,0
also the cast seemed pretty good throughout in keeping the plot straight,1
the story is fairly slow but very funny in its original style,1
his best and most successful film since the big bad which was the last,1
where does he fit in his plot or even what he're trying and what does he do,1
it was just too much to bear and i can only think of 3 reasons i think it makes a good documentary of china '73,1
i'm hoping the best for all of them,0
the second time the softly lit colour stairway provides the setting for what is an iconic image in cinema peter and june frozen sidebyside their marvelled eyes fixed forward in the frame their fate sealedbr br the unlikely affection shared between peter and june never turns mushy or verbose it 's treated with nobility and the perception that the couple are already suitable enough to be married and simply need to convince people of their love so it can keep them together,0
patrick moose is one of those actors that really deserves better and more credit than this movie does,1
qualified to be a serious film maker is nope,1
for once the director of a macdowell film did not make her beauty another character in the film,0
it has an eery feel with it 's dark interpretations of illusions,0
well it've become a popular cult film and i hope that this movie goes on a big and good run,1
9 out of 10,0
my comment would have been added to the release date section but i could n't find a place for it,0
he was also 78 when this movie was filmed,0
the music is by nicholas naugham a director known for his surrealist paintings,1
now when it comes time for you to decide whether or not this is a comedy or a drama this is the movie foryou,1
unfortunately i do n't have this opinion about daniel burke who played lonnie,0
the last scene is a perfect example,1
to say that this film wasn't well received would probably be an understatement,1
people who have not read the book are going to think that a movie like this just does not fit into the book,1
the movie was so incredibly bad i did nst know at the end that i had just become a zombie,1
as for the actual production it'seems like it was shot by a group with specialties in filmmaking,1
all else is top bracketbr br and now that that 's done br br the writing,0
there 's no story to speak of but bartlett uses images of nature particularly the human face and form to provoke a sequence of emotional reactions integrating these biological phenomena into the highlyindustrial form of modern technology,0
lee was so funny she never left a trace of anything going,1
the other characters don't really have names for themselves although i did nay do that when this show was first released but at least they had namesbr br there were some scenes where you really wanted the show around for some kind reason,1
you get absorbed into the dream and you 're let go only at the end credits,0
it is a classic,1
standards are often too hard,1
br br if this room was on fire you would n't be hot lewis repliesbr br director herbert ross shoots everything in a very casual and understated way with low lighting and midrange shots even in emotional moments so as to leave room for the comedy and the film 's overall zen message of grace through quiet acceptance,0
i do n't think he 's portrayed as a redneck criminal or thief but that 's just my opinionbr br this is a solid westerntype movie for everybody 's tastes,0
brilliant,1
he was the best of the actors from the original film,1
no you're deadbr br,1
there'seems to be some kind character in the film who is just waiting and watching the action and there could very well really be at some level some kind character of him,1

absolutely one of my favorite movies of all time,0
he is in formed by miss boop that it would be 200 in depression era money to make the purchase,0
this film is so incredibly overthetop that there is barely a plot in its plot line,1
the script is very funny the actors are really pretty and the story is pretty good especially with all that is happening in this time period,1
what follows is not a film but merely my opinion of my view on the moviebrittany sheen''esquirement on the film and the controversy that she started her career onbrillium that eventually followed is not very interesting,1
he is also a drunk a womaniser and in the middle of a midlife crisis,0
well this tale ends with a perfect holiday scream,0
it 's a very hard thing to capture and probably impossible in hollywood,0
i talked him into going to try out for one of the bit parts offered and lo and behold he came home wthe script,0
roger depardot is excellent throughout and you really do love this little gem,1

complete nonsense in every mannerbrilliantly written great actors brilliant performances,1

in that way it pulls off an almost impossible feat to be so overthetop and yet so painfully restrained to be so charged and yet so understated and even the explosives finales are virtuosic feasts of the eye,0
brilliant,0
judd nelson is cute at least in my opinion and he was excellent in the role as stanley caldwell,0
perhaps there is a parallel universe to this film but it''ve never happened in my life,1

ned kelly has become such a popular identity because he does represent that aspect of australian culture that does n't trust or accept authority,0
it really is a pity,1
moreover she and cox do have chemistry which makes the romance in the film even more notable,0
quietly but surely it all comes to a point when the bad guys realize the plot point of this show is they do not understand their actionsbr br the bad guys get to take the movie,1
this is a silent film with a few sound effects as sound pictures were just coming into their own,0
the fact that it has a lot of nudity and sex scenes makes this a movie worth checking for,1
except for the music,1
it was sentimental and romantic but thankfully not anywhere as cheesy as it could have been for my fellow australians watch 'the lighthorseman' and you will see what i mean,0
this was an exteremely good historical drama,0
i would have rated it a 10 if they had had hassie and little luke,0
after watching the movie i agree that this is one of the few movies that does a book justice,0

kim hunter is surprisingly good as june the woman who talked to peter as his plane was falling from the skies,0
and again your stomach sinks with his soul as it goes down its spiral like watching a beloved brother turn into a hood,0
this film was the most difficult film in my opinion to understand,1
the film score by alexandre desplat was fulfilling there are fifteen tracks besides two tracks of the delightful waltz,0
it was interesting to see jared goldwyn in this movie because he had a very small role in the film which had him playing a very wellmeaning but shallow character,1
ugly,1
i mean it was a love story yes but what made it outstanding from the rest was that it was told in an entertaining wholesome mannerbr br for me it is the representation of modern fairy tale,0
give me the money for it,1
anthony quinn has a very short appearance that already shows what a great actor he was going to become,0

steins and clark find that they have to fight their demons to save the day,1
the dialogue is just awful and the whole film feels rushed at times and the characters don't have much depth of personality,1

she hires an assistant at work with her true intention being to find love,0
the acting isn't too bad either and you've been there done done that even if it're the worstbr br it 'll probably be one to avoid,1
a second reason is that the poetry expressed by homere in his poem is well given by the production,0
it goes quite as easy as in rear window but with a less compelling context,0
after that i decided maybe the director had not taken into accounts and made the movie not only about two people who are not related but also about a man who is still alive,1
even so schneebaum himself has moved into a kind of higher innocence that suggests the possibility of saving humanity from its own destructiveness,0

however their leader wicket is a delightfully memorable creation and watching how they handle the imperial troops' technology with their simple natural weapons provides a nice contrastbr br by the time we get to the third act though the pace picks up again as we intercut between the ewoks battle against the troops lando and the rebel forces launching an attack against the empire 's allnew halfcompleted death star and luke 's final showdown with darth vader and the emperor,0

realist or not this is a very poor thriller from the 80'sspace period that really has its merits but also has its flawsbr br it is a good thriller with some good scenes but then it loses its point for me mainly due to a weak screenplaybr br i've never seen a movie that did that,1
the cast were absolutely brilliant and you can see it in their eyes every single time they show us a little girl,1

he goes to a school in new yelchin where he learns about the curse and his ability to control the power,1
i really like the scene where marion davies plays herself and is encountered by herself playing the main character of the movie patricia pepoire,0
it is stimulating thought provoking a mirror to the post war world and the relations between peoplesbr br the cinematography is simply stunning and the effect of mixing monochrome and technicolour to accent the different worlds works seamlessly,0
and what 'll save a film from being overused,1
the film wasn't a success but it'sat right after they were done with the jaguars and the rest,1
abyssea kruger is perfect as rachael maria giorgias and joan crawford is perfect in this show as maria 'the only child on a doomed planetbrilliance is a good show to try your socks off on,1
last year i saw lilja 4ever that tells an identical story in the former soviet union therefore this problem does exist in third world countries,0

ok the film opens with clint howard as an americabandoned doctor who is being chased by a group of vengeful vietnam veterans but is caught in a trap and the group of vets who come at them to save him are actually the badasses but the end result is some really good special effects,1

the band dee dee especially always disliked the movie through the 80 's but the fans always loved and could recite most of the movie while waiting to get into ramones shows,0
but the script and acting does not add up to anything,1
recommended to all followers of odysseus' ever returning,0
or at least it didbrigitta'stole the most beautiful scenes in movie history and even though the movie is not as good as the book that 'll make a book a lot more enjoyable the story still manages,1
stone has no idea what to make of the situation which turns out to be more than he can handle,1
both the cast and the directing team seem intent on bringing something fresh to the genre with this,1
this is unlike anything i 've seen in the movie theater before,0
it 'll make you cry on the screen,1
a film that can so easily combine sex gender relations politics and art is a rarity these days,0
after hearing this on the radio they called the police,1
this was done by jason rebecca who is a writer for the imax film festival,1
maybe i am a little biased when comparing this to most other films but i don't think this movie was very good at all its definitely just a little bit much,1
home room does not show the school shooting but rather the aftermath and the effects of the community and the town,0
all i wanted is to point the fact that the movie isnt from sweden but from denemark,0
like it or not the action scenes were welldone and had an impact on me,1
the action takes us from an indian raid on a cabin one of the best parts of the movie with jean arthur excellent while attempting to appease the warpainted natives,0
i give it a 10 more if possible,0
it just does nothing for me either,1
the second is the one with paul schulzbr br i can never say i liked any aspect of this movie but i liked the ending and this was not one you had expectations after,1
i really enjoyed this movie but i got to say next to pierce brosnan greg kinear is pretty lackluster,0
the whole production value is terrible,1
i 've read a few negative comments in here about hope davis but i thought she was quite good as a mousy housewife with a dark side buried deep within,0
it may sound like a bad film but you only have to see it once before and not the next,1
wow,1
the movie is a little dark but that'ssay it had some interesting ideas about women it 'll be interesting to watch once the movie hits the ground runningbrussels and is a must watch for the women,1
if it 'll make you laugh maybe if you're a child who likes the humour but who does n 'll give a damn about it for no real reason,1
her daughter may be a little too young but she certainly has a great talentbrad pfeifer does his best to do his job in a pretty womanised way,1
without his acting ability i ca nadar in a movie like 'the bad and ugly is a bad thing but the beautiful one can make a great movie no matter what budget,1
wow,1
this movie is their best right now the setting of the movie was beautiful which also is a huge attraction,0
fifth it was made in the 1930'ssixties,1
the script does have some twists,1
br br the story begins with kate having a seizure while in a bathroom and the hospital staff take her from the bathroom and her brother dr darren've the doctor who takes them to their basement but dr david auteur of the hospital'sanitaria has the hospital staff take their mother back but she goes to the hospital in bed and the father does n 'care about her anymorebride and the nurse are both killed but david has to go back home at night,1
it 's not long on style short on substance it is complex in its simplicity and beautiful absolutely beautiful,0
br br in fact the one minor criticism i have at all of the film is that sometimes the comedy elements become a little ott subtlety goes out of the window to the detraction of the main story ricky gervais' cameo for example was far too much just ricky gervais doing his usual david brent from the office comedy persona for my liking and in my opinion created an unwelcome and jolting break from the magical spell of the progressing story br br but this is a minor quibble in an otherwise immaculately cast and scripted fairytale with a good mixture of action and romance,0
there are moments of genius throughout this movie if you can see it now,0
he looks like an innocent boy who was in a fight with a drunk,1
it does not look like it has been made to be enjoyed like a book it is a piece which should be looked after,1
i went to a small advance screening of this movie on july 19th knowing no more than the names of a few of the actors and that it was a fantasyadventure quest of some sortbr br the plot line really is nothing like i have seen and a unique story is certainly appreciated with everything else that is currently in or coming soon to theaters,0
some can try but what is the outcome if no one can really have what they really want or feel they can even express to say what they want,0
the acting in this one is bad,1
in fact the entire plot of hickory dickory dock could have been used in a giallo,0
literally dozens of children'spoiler and there 'll be people who know something i ca not yet understand how a movie about a kid getting raped or raped by his peers could be so poorly actedbr br i 'll leave you all with that,1
all in all a great movie which stands out amongst the current choices of action special effects and schlock horror,0
it 'll make you wanna go out and grab a beer and a hot chocolate or something like it,1
while this is definitely one of those films that 'll get you drunk with a few drinks and then go on some serious killing spree with little effort whatsoever it just woefully fails in every departmentbr br a lot of films are made of the concept for a good plot but there're always an obvious lack of continuity or any kind of narrative,1
as for myself there has to not be too much that i have not read about this movie and i'm sure a better one could not be written than the one it appears in,1
it 's a blackandwhite movie occasionally intertwined with red in form of blood a red dress etc,0
and wanted to cheer lee grant as she levels criticism at cloris leachman 's hair color,0
yes it does have the look of a horror film but does that really make it worth a trip,1
she never really had that in her repertoire but by a long shotbr br for the most important part of the film the story is nary believable at least until the climactic scene,1
it never really takes offbr br the supporting cast is really good although i do find myself questioning why they even bothered to write an original script for this film i found it very difficult at times to follow and the character'seventh wheelers in particular did nsthe fact this movie had only just been made back in 1985 and not a year old wasn't particularly interesting to watch the way a lot of people looked at it br the only bright thing about this film was that its a good idea not a horror film which made more sense at the timebut i think if you're going to be a fan of a good story check,1
the plot was interesting but the ending wasn't the film 'final cut nor will it ever be the end,1
the movie moves like a river you have to be willing to follow it through ebbs and flows but it is well worth it in the end,0
if a company decides to publish games on this movie i will not get suprised as it carries all the videogames elements,0
but sometimes a movie needs to make you feel unconfortable to work,0

david has dreams that warn him of the future,0
br br he calls the detective agency wondering where are the guys he asked for earlier,0
a chance encounter between a salesman and a hitman changes both their lives,0
it is most visible in the film 's three key scenes the hotel bar a bullfight during which julian tells danny what he does for a living and takes him through a dress rehearsal of an assassination and a scene in which julian turns up at danny 's house six months later,0
sure it 'pses off a bit at times though in a more dramatic way i really enjoy his humorbr br i wasn't expecting much and still am not disappointed,1
director of photography and director'samuel jackson should have used the most original camera in the world,1
rock and roll high school was centered around the ramones,0
i saw it twice in the mid70 's and then it disappeared,0
at the same time we see a character like alexandre who probably loves to hear himself talk whether it 's about some movie he saw or something bad from his past eustache makes it so that the film itself is n't pretentious though it could appear to be but that it 's about pretentiousness what lies beneath those who are covering up for their internal flaws what they need to use when they 're ultimately alone in the morning,0
without that annoying prime directive floating over their heads every time they encounter races it could be cool and scott bakula was without a doubt a great choice for captain and the vulcan babe is hot too i gave this a full 10 it blows away all the other series openers i hope this goes longer than 7 years,0
this movie was so great,0
one of my all times favorite movies,1
though there 're only half a dozen episodes it is n't filled with action but emotional things,0
oh that was good,1

when gundam0079 became the movie trilogy most of us are familiar with a lot of it was sheer action and less of anything else,0
also he was the star of the film toobut the film in a much longer runningtime,1
this has to have something to do in terms of the setting or the actors doing their job well,1
910 30 minutes of pure holiday terror,0
while it tends to minimise the lesbian aspects as well as the african story both of which were so vivid in the book the movie remains true to its themes allowing the voice of alice walker to shine throughbr br i could n't begin to respond to the controversy that surrounded this film,0
watching this film in a theater made many a viewer think about the way the film has been interpreted,1
but it was made and the reason is because lucy desi are still such huge stars and certain people in american society feel that the rest of society needs to know all about our tv and movie stars,0
it is a great example of why people do n'mean 'wrong things'',1
much like the other reviewers i have read the film actually plays in some kind or something different in some ways the whole premise of a movie of a different breed seems to me a bit offbeatbrittany shearer is brilliant with a wonderful sense of class,1
but still stop comparing and enjoy it for what it isbr br go and rent this onebr br,0
the fish is actually in the cat 's mouth at one point if i remember correctly,0
clark 'the phantom city is really just another movie in which tom holly and cate gee do a little bit of acting a lot of makeup a little bit of directing but all their work for this movie was wasted by the very first scenes,1

in fact although tony martinez seemed completely capable to contribute to the conversation he was not allowed to speakout and say too much during the reunion show,0
our overall favorite is the 1951 black white classic because alastair sim is ebeneezer scrooge and his conversion rings the truest,0
it makes the ideas of exploration exciting to us again,0
the film has many funny scenes and a few great one liners,1
at the end we are left to see which ones got the final twist and for whatever reason decided it would be just great,1
if you are not a fan of the movies in general check out the classics like the shining of elan or even the wonderful and wonderful new carrera,1
grander,0
even the detectives are seeking the answer we all do why,0
it was beautiful,0
with a special spell the scrye you can see certain things that otherwise would be invisible to you,0

as for adults there 's not much here not to like if you 're a fan of japanese monster movies you 'll enjoy the heck out of thisbr br cool fun stuff kind of dark at times but perhaps that 's just miike and what a wild ride,0
ring 2 is a very similar movie to ring 1 and that 'll tell,1
and to be brutally blunt i ca not see it taking place any where so i ca notothe worldbrigitte zug does quite well as the evil witch who must confront the true nature which must surely never get out,1
it'screamed my soul out of me,1
the movie're supposed be scary but i was n 'just watching a tv movie without seeing a scary monster or any creature,1
it seems he was made of cardboard and plastic but was a fairly good job overall and very good acting for his agebr br the first part of the film takes the usual formula and the characters are ned and michael and they do n've a very complicated relationship,1
but it really was the worstbr br the entire episode was a complete disaster especially the one where the girl was being used as a pet by the dad who wants to keep a secret from her,1
see it,0
jabba,0
i really did wish to see much much more of katherine heigl,0
there is no exhibition in it,0
it makes me ever so sad that films like american beauty leaving las vegas sexy beast and fight club ratings skyrocket off the charts in popularity when they in fact at least in this viewers opinion should have received an r rating r that is for rubbish,0
new characters are introduced and old ones face new unexpected challenges,0
her face can never be seen but she wears a blood red cloak and produces the most ghastly laugh whenever she made a new victim,0
i hate overlong overtalky french movies but my favorite movie of all time is the longest and talkiest french movie of them all,0

you should really be careful what you axe santa for,0
there 'll be a lot of tears and laughs,1
it gives the camera a unique ability to move and follow the characters and trier makes use of these abilities,0
much of the time it just seems to be a mix between comedy and dramatic drama,1
his name is robert a,1
my only cavil is that hope davis playing the ohsotolerant wife does n't appear more often she could have been a marvellous foil to these menbr br this movie is like a matador it plays with the audience while going for a kill,0
ho nung ha ho'san is the best i have ever seen,1
you see when they get in the van you could nada it 'll be one of the greatest movies ever made and i will forever be thankful for it as i watch this film again every day in my memory,1
i ca n't tell you all how much i love this movie,0
and forever after whenever you think of scrooge the image your mind will conjure up will be that of george c scott,0
you would comfortably watch the movie with your parents except if you 're already or going to be soon engaged,0
i reccomend storm riders over this any day,0
as far the story goes he wants to be a police officer but in the case of the police chief in general the story is more like you can never get past the police chief,1
i'm so glad i was feeling lousy yesterday afternoon and showtime was running the color purple,0
it 's a study in perfectionbr br the other members of the cast are splendid as well but then again they have to be in order to maintain the integrity of scott 's performance and they do,0
brilliance is a film that has been made with an eye for realism,1
marion davies proved with this movie she really had great talent and was not just william randolph hearst 's mistressbr br the story involves a hick from georgia coming to hollywood with every expectation that she would be an instant star,0
then the film moves back to the rebel alliance and what 's going on in the war,0
anyone who is willing to spend a few hours on this film will agree with the statement above,1

sunny a cocktail waitress in the dc area is a bit dim to put in mildly,0
von trier brilliantly paints his vision on screen,0
but i guess the film is just another one that is made to tell a different narrative but you can see that it is all a bit of an insult to everyone involvedbrillia is actually much younger in this movie than it should be,1
all in all not really worth my money unless you have a sweet tooth,1
and she absolutely nailed the routines that were recreated the professor and the grape stomping in particular,0
that'sthat is for me the worst part about the whole movie,1
smartly shot and wellacted this is the third film in a trilogy of films that follow the adventures and adventures of kennedy,1
this movie is not only about war but about love,1
the villains are completely wicked and the heroes are refreshingly pure,0
yes i know there is a lot more in it but as it stands i believe it is worth seeing,1
with the first third being almost as dull and boring this fourth was nada,1

it 'll probably kill one person in the process,1
patrick stewart portrayed him excellently in one of the most recent versions filmed and michael caine despite acting alongside the muppets was positively cold,0

even the music was bad,1

their is a massacre in which several of gable 's men are killed and crawford was a witness to the whole thing,0
the acting by all was very good the songs the story the dialog by all were very funny and well acted by all,1
but for some reason i wasn't quite certain whether the film is really supposed to be about the life of an older man or about an elderly women who in her hey day had a big fortune but suddenly her life turns tragic and her father falls for him in the endbrutalbrutal and uneventfully a good scene when marie and her father leave the placebr br i was pretty disappointed with this movie,1
i had watched as much of the series as i could manage to watch on television but unfortunately started a job that got me working evenings,0
all i 'll say is don't take this series as seriously as the others,1

in the movie they are the hero and the bad guys are the victimbr br the plot is simple yet it could n the end,1
this movie should never be allowed in any cinema,1

smug and sure of himself and his ability to shoot a gun jimmy had become a top mobster in new york city 's underworld,0
that one is nuff told,1
he seems to be a lonely man and his loneliness is only in a short timebr br this movie is really about what the mind can do and this is ned everett in his best of selfindebtedness and he has some amazing acting ability,1
and you can read my review here as it deals more with the story rather than with bobby and how he came into this world,1
my problem is theres too many characters,0
how long for what,1
its heros are a couple of dud detectives whose sophomoric attitudes lead them down some very silly roads,0
far from being crassly exploitative it is a beautiful and respectful rendering of one of the western culture 's defining textsbr br i was moved by the plight of odysseus and his followers touched by the drama of the fall of troy intrigued by the way the gods played with the fate of mortals,0
it was such a well done movie that you were happy when so and so died,0
it 's not merely a disaster film not simply an exploration into australian aboriginal spirituality and certainly more than a simple court drama,0
i am reminded of a bjork music video with this same quality a music video about the making of a music video ad infinitum with each iteration getting weirder and more cartoonish,0
but that 's yesterday 's news,0
i'm not much of an expert on acting or other movie details but this movie just hit me deep,0
johnson has had a good part here,1
that've got to hurt,1
but for the most part the plot is simple enough to be a comedy and well handled even if it just is it is a fairly good one,1
but the movie is one of my most favourite moviesbr br it also has a lot of great special effects i would watch any horror movie but this one just looked too fake,1
if the premise was to entertain you i suggest you 'll see this instead,1

after zentropa von trier moved away from this type of audacious technical experiment towards dreary overrated unnuanced sap like breaking the waves and dancer in the dark,0
she just radiates beauty and grace on the screen and is a phenomenal actress,0
this is not a film to laugh in but to show a side to your life,1
but i do concur with the reviewer that the claustrophobia and muted colors it 's overdone for there are to be sure beautiful historic buildings parks squares you can find in bucharest or in any historic city center of eastern europe and bucharest 's did n't get much of any footage in this film,0
even the script by darren gabrielle had me rolling,1
this film captured my heart from the very beginning when hearing quincy jones' first notes or seeing the wonderful color of purple of the flowers in the meadows,0
however there is something more in the way the show is shot that gives new meaning to it''brilliance is on the other side of the fence where it is a crime that has been done,1

the story of this movie is so simplebr br all the characters are ordinary men who have lost their lives,1
he even gets to watch the naked lady with the hot looking blonde hair,1
and how did linda link that up with her previous roles in the same filmbr br i would nega expect anything less from a film produced by this low quality company with a budget of about 25000000,1
this may not be casualtybr br i think that the title is a hope about life,0
it'stinks and is filled with clich characters all of which have no redeeming qualities,1
or as in the book the woman is a prostitute and not a prostitute at least in the book,1
the first part of the film resolves the cliffhanger left by the previous one with an elaborate escape plan that is in keeping with the incredible suspense and action of the first two films,0
basically it is a story based in two worlds one obviously real the other fictitious but the filmmakers say at the beginning that it is only coincidence if it is a real place,0
minor plot elements such generation of the family,1
as a young artist myself i was quite drawn by the look and colors on display by this film,1

calling this film just about the most retarded movie ever made,1
sista' remember my name,0
james earl jones still provides the voice for vader and he is still very very goodbr br in terms of how the movie looks its pretty safe to say that the star wars universe looks better than in either of the previous movies but this was always lucas' fort so that is really to be expected,0

the movie concentrates on three friends and follows them from those early days during the onset of the war in majorca to a few years later as two of those friends meet again when they are at a sanatorium lost in the countrysidebr br we first meet three boys that are playing happily,0

everyone else is so dull so silly they're just as bad,1
there are constant references to assembly line production where workers are treated as cogs in a machine overseen by managers wielding clipboards controlling how much hair the workers leave exposed and firing workers who meet all criteria but who may in some unspecified future make a mistake,0

i 've seen this film more than once now and there 's always someone complaining about the obvious construction of the plot afterwards,0
1000000000000010000000000000,0
as the title describes this film has a strong message to all those out in hollywood and that 'll make many a happy camper and a camper of all timesbride and a crew of professional actors make this a very enjoyable movie,1
but the plot could have been made more interesting and nonlinear than what it wasbr br there were too question in my mind when the movie ended 1 has the movie really ended,0
it 'll only get worse,1
how it 's related is one of the great revelations of the movie,0

a fantasy naturally some very funny material,0
therefore one can hardly speak about communication in this movie,0
after a series of netflix blockbuster and local library duds this movie restored my faith in great film making,0
part of the appeal of this film can perhaps be its strong performances by the cast but it're also the strong message that the americans of that time were still so afraid of the black race that they just wanted to be taken advantage of in order that they could get away,1
but the one thing that makes the episode so fascinating to listen to is how the series got startedbr br the episode 'the end is so predictable that i find myself laughing even more,1
so instead the novel which is much dryer and more serious in tone was used as a launching pad a motif to create variations on for a horrorthriller story centered on valentine 's day,0
the story told is not just a family history but a history of life,0
how much does it cost to make a movie like the great detective story than that the budget is so small,1
from here on in sur mes levres becomes an increasingly intense crime drama escalating into some of the most violently graphic scenes that have been shown on the screen in recent years,0
br br yes the 1944 home in indiana is a better movie but it 's also a very different movie,0
they really could have done this a completely serious piece if they had wanted as the discussions about human values and meaning of love no matter what 's your past or what you 've done for living get so serious and genuinely effective at the middle part that the film immediately gets much more noteworthy than our average kung fu spectacle actioner,0
for example there is a preciously funny moment when tadashi 's small band of yokai companions finds themselves let down and abandoned by the other yokai and shojothe avuncular kirin heralddoes what many a stressedout japanese adult would do,0
this was just plain weird,1
what really makes this piece stand up is how the director creates an environment where we feel real emotions,1
and you're not watching someone who is not smart,1
br br one of the best westerns ever,0
think of it as the old andy griffith show with musical numbers a little more plot and wide screen technicolor,0
this one is an excellent addition to that genre,0
well worth a rental,0
cherie currie is way hot and is amazing here i really felt sorry for her character as she had a very likable character that just needed help she gives a powerful performance and created a very memorable character she was amazing,0
it 'll make you jump to your seat in astonity,1
the pacing is n't as sharp as in the first part and i found myself less gripped by this one,0
it makes more sense but it isn't worth watching,1
this film could only have worked as an ode to the early 20st century so the director and the producers wanted to make this the best movie ever made in the ubrated futurebr br the story is that a group of teenagers in a cabin in north americabria take up a family with two teenage children,1
the dialogue was smart witty fun even the mush had good dialoguebr br score i give this component 7 points,0
this is a lovely film based on a novel by nabokov,0
this movie had an interesting cast it mat not have had an a list cast but the actors that were in this film did a good job,0
son of hare i think that it was probably the most fun scene in this movie,1
the acting is also very good,1

widmark is the man and that'seldom is he quite funny,1
all in all well worth seeing,1
but the whole thing is a mess,1
busy phillips acting is off the chain,0
it 's a fairly familiar movie in terms of plot but rick roberts is appealing as the imperfect husband martha macisaac is equally appealing as the daughter and mitzi kapture does a good job if that was her goal of being angry and sometimes pretty hard to like,0
they get the money,0
what i like most is seeing the actor and director take control of their character,1
the film was made in 1993 and the film was a surprise success,1
other than that what the film is good for is its use in establishing the characters and the story,1
tom cruise has always been a strong actor but has never really taken his acting to a higher level before,1
matthau has a little better grasp on reality than burns who seems senile by his repeating himself but in actuality matthau 's sense of rejection by the world that once applauded him make him less willing to behave properly,0
also a number of my classmates were in the crowd scenes especially the ones shown at the amusement park,0
the audio is mono but nicely balancedbr br extras forget it,0
in this he shows anger at scrooges attitudes and really makes scrooge reconsider,0
casablans are the best and i think the most important thing in it to give it a chance because there've been more movies about thembruno de armas is the great director with a real eye for a good script,1
but i guess this story about a child 'playing with fire in a small town is a little disturbing and perhaps a touch on the reality of the life we live,1
br br the cast was also very good,0
sammo is interested in local baker girl ping while max one day meets a mysterious and beautiful fennie yuen kitying he falls madly in love with,0
i am haunted by waters,0
but here he does it again,1
i ca n't imagine anyone not being entranced by this film,0
she was horrible in this,0
it 'll be great to see that ken wilson gets it right,1
there are enough laughs in this one to make you go for the ride,1
i'm a fan of tv movies in general and this was one of the good ones,0
the film shows that william haines had comic skills beyond his usual formula of the obnoxious overconfident guy who turns everyone against him learns his lesson and then redeems himself by winning the football game the polo game etc,0
there're several instances where the writerdirector actually attempts to bring you a meaningful storybrigitte porter is a lovely wife who just happens to get hit by the truck,1
and though the focus is on war 's heinous tattoo on children the transference to like effects on soldiers and citizens of adult age is clear,0
brilliantly written and directed with excellent cinematography the film is a definite must viewing for anyone who likes action films and has the chance to sit through a film with a very good cast,1
but with all the loading times and some difficult enemies in between that can become frustrating,0
this picture also has the best product placement for beer you will ever see in a kids' movie,0
the brunette chick is actually the most masculine person therebr br i think it 's kind of funny that the brunette chick gets so obviously turned on by veronica,0
a stunning realization occurs when some sort of phenomenon takes place,0
but he is the type who has no idea about the situation and he has a lot of trouble getting by,1
or as one reviewer put it in reference it 'just did n're about as bad as it gotbr br it isn't long after that i saw it again and thought that the plot might have more to say about it,1
all of who knew how to film anything was surprised to discover that it was the first of its kind that aired on tv,1
this one i adore,0
fun,1
suddenly it 's darth vader at the front and viewers realize that it 's the story about anakin not just luke,0
brosnan says it with his charm while he 's drinking his margarita as usually,0
many of the sequences of the movie are not well acted and are not memorable,1
i do n't know what those who label the film boring were watching there 's so much packed into it that it never remains the same film for more that 15 min at a time,0
the cars and gags and even the less in your face stuff cracked us up,0
put another person in that position and what 'the hell happened to the rest?' i think notbr br the script is lame the director has no idea whether it 'll work as a script is lame,1
thats a great moment,0
this movie is about as real as it gets,1
he is such a versatile actor,0
wait,1
he is an excellent choice as a supporting cast,1
it've got some of the finest martial arts scenes i ever witnessed and is an absolute joy to watchbr br the supporting cast isn't anything particularly notable it 'll come across for all you 'll want to know the story,1
stuff like this happened and is still happening in the world,0
sometimes i can appreciate that sort of thing but the film fails to make that point,1
also when a man is being chased by women there are many people with guns going around trying to kill him,1
i would n't really recommend this film as a great cinematic entertainment but i will say you wo n't see much bette acting anywhere,0
an intriguing and powerful movie that is an example for all the people who think they know too much about movies,1
at a party at a club there're several girls who 'll watch out for pixar who've got a whole army of ninjas to help them fight the fiends,1
part of the difficulty is in adapting the story to any modern medium and it is impossiblebrainedly difficult indeed,1
you really get the feeling of being inside this imaginary nightmarish time warp,0
110,1
to be honest i had no idea what this movie was about when i started it,0
that is funny,0
foster giving one of her most perceptive affecting and underrated performances to date is basically the group 's den mother who presides over the wellbeing of both herself and the others she 's especially concerned about the goodhearted but reckless and selfdestructive currie whose carelessly hedonistic lifestyle makes her likely to meet an untimely endbr br this picture offers a poignant insightful often devastatingly credible and thoroughly absorbing examination of broken dysfunctional families which exist directly underneath suburbia 's neatly manicured surface and the tragic net result of such families tough resilient but unhappy and vulnerable kids who have to confront the trials and tribulations of growing up on their own because their parents are either too inconsiderate or even nonexistent,0
this film as low budget as it may be is one of the best psychological thrillers i 've ever seen,0
hard rock never suits better within a serial killermystery movie,0
walking home after the film i was humming the familiar waltz music that natalia and alexandre were dancing to,0
charisma is also pretty and does a very good dance number,1
this is a very highenergy comedy that features loads of great music and some surprising moments,0
the film is also extremely lighthearted and funny in a way that'screwles the heart into being fun at times,1
actually it're a bit of a stretch to believe that a group could create and use a 3 inch camera in the middle of every other filmbr br this is a great film but should natomi is a mustsee for any lover of cinema,1
helmer the doctor you love to hate,0
it've been done for tv before but this is one i'ves done a lot of work on over the years,1
this movie just has nancy and the other kids talking like the girls in this video game,1
for such a very low budget it was done well as an insomniac myself i can sympathize with the main character although my sleeping problems have never been as intense or as disturbing,0
the movie is so very funny,1
where star wars created a whole new experience in cinema and empire brought us to alien worlds of swamps ice and clouds jedi lamely recycled the locations of the first film,0
anyway the final episode is the beginning and it 'll be the last,1
instead the matador is a funny and sometimes touching character study,0

propaganda and the movie are also very similar,1
it was hot and i was tired,0
while defending the aborigines david learns the last wave theory and begins to wonder whether it 's just mythologybr br the movie 's last sequence is a metaphor for descending into the depths of one 's mind,0
those who are familiar of his work will find the film interesting,1
johnston darcy is the perfect choice as lara the head of the town 'police force,1
this is the only time i ca n't decide which was better the book or the moviebr br whoopi goldberg is awesome and oprah winfrey such a good actress she could be funny happy and miserable all at the same time,0
what a wonderful fanciful movie stardust isbr br i could easily end it with that one statement and suffice to say one could take it as a very strong recommendation to go see itbr br at a time when hollywood seems bent on forcing remakes and sequels down our throats stardust makes us remember why we go to the movies in the first place to escape reality for a couple of hours and explore other lives other times or other planets,0
i hardly ever cry in a movie but this movie made me feel like crying,0
timeless is a brilliant movie and one would really like it to be given a better chance after watching this film in the first place if you are a person who wants to see a good film of its kind,1
god has the ability to send down to hell any man that does not live his days should be sent back in hell,1
the actress portrays the role of poonam with such conviction that you cannot imagine anybody else replacing her,0

once every hundred years the events repeat themselves in this castle and a red lady kills six innocent victims before killing the black lady herself,0
they need to learn and they need to take a real lesson from each other and start the conversationbr br there are many interesting points to the movie,1
i first see this film almost 21 years ago when it was an itv matine,0
there 's a wes craven in chicago feel to it,0
true they 're not the best thing that ever happened to star wars but they did happen so deal with it,0
the problem is they have n't even seen each other in over a decade,0
this particular version is good enough but does n't do anything different or special is a bit too linear predictable to be considered a classic,0
when maria escapes to rio de janeiro expecting a better life she is explored by the cften vera br br anjos do sol exposes the sad and shameful reality of child prostitution in brazil through the fate of the girl maria,0
it will not disappoint if you like the 80'sean penn movie,1
the film then continues with a short story about the story of a new yugio and his love affair with a local girl named tara,1
no,1
sadly the great cinematography of the canadian rockies is done few favours by a distinctly average dvd transfer with only the theatrical trailer as an extra,0
wow,1
as a director of that caliber she should be applauded more highly for her ability to bring a realistic realistic story here,1
she looks beautiful throughout the whole movie and portrays an innocent and shy traditional girl perfectlybr br shahid kapoor performs brilliantly too,0
think of all the other people who went in and killed and did nay of everything in their lives who died in the movie and had a normal life,1
and the fact the actors were trying so hard as to mimic the characters is nigh on hilarious,1
but its worth watching because it is good and micheaux does good with the little he has,0
despite that i think it was a good film,1
so i got on my computer and tried to find out about them and found this site so if there is anyone out there that can tell me what ever happened to lydia reed and michael winkelman little luke i would be thankful,0
kingdom of queens is a rather forgettable film which was released in 1983 the sequel was released in 1993 in 1990 the original is much better to be enjoyed by its sequel lovers but the remake was just as bad as its first,1
by the way the character in the story isn't much of a villain he'ses a good guy when you think he knows about it,1
carla finally gets laid,0
in the case of tarantino 'lliam schwarzer i was pleasantly shocked and impressed with his acting,1
when he wanted to deliver the goods though he did,0
while at the studio commissary the peppers run into billy boone a slapstick comedian,0
centred around a young girl the film stars joel grey a gay man who is out on parole for the robbery of a bank in the us and ends on a sour and miserable note that seems not only to include a string quartet of the very most uncharacteristically bad guys of the 1980'seecur,1
only one good thing is that she did n 'do some research and decided to go to chicago to do research,1
most of the time his chief aide col black holds his tongue he does not wish to be in front of a firing squad as he could be,0
thumbs down a lot for this flick,1
not entirely true in this show though there 's a couple characters that were weak and improved by the voice acting but overall the characters stand on their ownbr br this is definitely for 16 and up,0
it just doesn't work,1
the film also has an excellent supporting role by richard douche,1
it was a great movie that everyone has seen but i'm sure if you didn't know who the writer the director or the acting coach or maybe if it 'was written by a little girl and not one person in it you probably know what i mean,1
she sees potential in this former thief and as the story unfolds their relationship grows in a very unusual pattern of codependence,0
for starters this film is about a disgruntled student who brings a gun to school and shoots roughly 9 students,0
most of them have a lot of problems with one or more of the villains and one or even two of those would be enough in a thriller,1
while parts of the movie are quite predictable such scenes in no way take away from the enjoyment of seeing the story played out,0
romantics who are willing to go with the amazing kinetic energy is this filmed allegorical poem will be well rewarded,0
everything about a horror movie the acting the plot and even the direction make us want for it to get better,1
freddy starts having visions of killing those in prison that he is in the film,1
perform like a real british drama you will get to see the story from a real actor who may not have even ever made this type of material beforebr br the performances were excellent and are very well matched to the style of this film and i really recommend it,1
most of the actors and actresses of these race films were n't the best but they were the only ones that could be afforded at the time micheaux and spencer williams could n't afford nina mae mckinney josephine baker ethel waters fredi washington paul robeson rex ingram and more of the bigger stars so micheaux and other black and white race filmmakers would use nightclub performers in their movies some were good some were n't great actors and actresses but i think micheaux and others knew most were n't good actors and actresses but they were used more as apart of an experiment than for true talent they just wanted their stories told and in return many black performers got to perform their true talents in the films,0
it also had a few funny moments but they got overshadowed a bit by the rest,1
he does nay all three but there can be more,1
this short is a wonderful addition and will not disappoint,1

that 's why she hides him out on the boat while the captain 's looking for him for the earlier killing of a trail handbr br jeff also has the misfortune of running into sleazy judge gannon who runs the town of skagway alaska,0
someone release this movie on dvd so it can take its hallowed place as on of the greatest films of all time in ten to twenty years when critics and film historians look back on the socalled films of the 1990 's and see how vapid they were for the most part and how lars von trier tried to revolutionize and revitalize the international film world with this masterpiece,0
however this does not help matters because the movie is very badly written and acted the ending may very well be a spoiler the way that the writers and filmmakers end up with an ending that does not have anything of any relevance whatsoever is the worst movie i have seen the writers should have used a very clever and clever script instead,1
br br though i flounder to recommend this as a must see it is a great story of australian history and the film does have some good actions sequences,0
the action is simply amazing esp,0
coincidentally the comedy studios used in this film are the original digs keystone had abandoned the year before br br colonel marmaduke oldfish pepper drives his daughter peggy from georgia to hollywood to star in the movies,0
the man in this case is represented by several different characters,0
the gag reel was fun i wo n't spoil it but there is a particular scene that makes buying the dvd worth it just so you can watch it over and over,0
so there are no surprises,1
i still think they should have been allowed to call it the sad fkers club though,0
leave it to fox to throw morality out the window let the debauchery flow,0
this film is a little of both,1
by all means check it out if you get the opportunity,1
also we have these ewoks who really are just detestable madeformattel teddy bears in a recycled version of what was supposed to be the big wookiefight at the end of star wars if they had n't run out of cash,0
an artistic telegram on the importance of caring about those around us,0
older boys are more attractive than younger boys in this version,1
the scene where he is auditioning for a potato chip commercial and ca n't get the name of the product right is a classic,0

she has an affair to an old college friend who has become more and more distant to her over the years while at the same time she has an infatuation with an older couple,1
i wish they would produce more episodes,0
it''re so predictable that if anyone out is even slightly interested they wo,1
in fact it does seem a little silly to have a guy named pam who looks like jack the ripper in one or two scenes of him in a rubber suit looking a little stupid if not in a nice costume in fact that would be one of what bothered me,1
it was just really lamebrbr the main bad thing was the bad acting,1
against all rules she sometimes holds back incriminating information found on her strip searches and other investigationsbr br this is not a pleasant film,0
women should be allowed to watch this movie and the men'should n've stayed away because there is no reason for them to have done so,1
do yourself and your kids an enormous kindness and help me to do the next action movie,1
two of my favorite actors were tom cruise as mrs,1
paul was a misfit from the offset and lived on the edge you would think that montana in the 1920 's had no such thing yet somehow gambling drinking and violent confrontations were as much a part of paul as was his fly fishing rod,0
bruno'suicide by stranglers a little more intelligent than the others is another one of those movies where one takes the premise and mixes it with some of the best and worst special effects ever done,1
i love the way that this game can make you literally jump out of your seat while you are playing it,0
what i loved about this film was the fact that mtv did have so many wonderful actors and also the great special effects and the fact the characters were so believable,1
the only one i do know that can say something i am pretty sure is i did something,1
because like in any horror movie your surroundings are usually pretty dark,0
the first few scenes are quite interesting to see and you get the feeling that when this was a serious movie it actually had a decent plot and interesting premise but then they just did it too much,1
in the same way as the previous review they should have made one or two more endings,1
other critics have not been so kind so if you 're not impressed by shootouts with unusual elements then you might be better off looking elsewhere,0
it'starts off with some nice camera movements,1
while this movie is still entertaining and the plot line is very original the film would be great for a younger generation to watch over and over over,1
la rossiva has it 'good looks and is in no way worse or better,1
apparently it 'll cost less and there 'll still have been some kind,1
this silly movie is really fun for the younger audiences,0
i liked it,0
what will her two friends say about the ensuing mischief,0
olivia hamnett and david gulpilil are solid in the supporting roles as well as the chap with the difficult name who plays charlie the old aborigin who can turn into an owl,0
her character is not believable at least not in light of the fact that the people involved must have been pretty young,1
alecia is an outcast who witnessed the entire shooting,0
i can assure you it is an extremely well made movie which you will enjoy,0
if you want to see a movie that entertain and entertain you give this film 10110 or more,1
it 's strange to think that it 's a wonderful life' came out in the same year,0
at least this was about a month after the first movie in the series started and the ending was very satisfying as well as somewhat moving,1
my favorite line in this movie is when logan bartholomew says rosy cheeks when he is talking about his baby daughter,0
but finlay 's marley is no ethereal spirit,0
you can imagine how this film is being distributed and you can imagine the problems its producers and the director will have dealing,1
kept me glued through the entire picture,0
what a surprise two outstanding performances by the lead actresses in this film,0
her acting is also very believable,1
a major example of this is the chess legend bobby fischer,0
br br in the earliest view of tos we see a starfleet with a more formal military aspect a bit of old earth navy,0
dickens wrote this story for a dark period in england 's life and it 's one of the few christmas tales that is really dark almost scary and it has to be scary in order to scare a man who has been a miser for so many years into turning around,0
you 'll love the story as a whole,1
the most interesting thing about the whole project is the scene when cate comes out as a woman and her family,1
the only reason to watch it is because some friends are having a party and i want my friends to show it to me,1
but i suggest giving it a shot,0
seeing the cameo outofcharacter appearances of so many mgm silent stars is worth the viewing in and of itself,0
actually it is amazingly close to the original plot by homer if not to the text itself,0
br br this is a great film of a great movie,1
in my mind whatever complaints that can be leveled against this film are easily overshadowed by its numerous strengths,0
flamenco coming out of the region of andalusia is a deeply felt amalgam of gitane hispanoarabic and jewish cultures,0
this is a good film that i probably wo n't remember for too long but at the time it was a complete joy,0
it seemed they went a completely different route with their original film,1
also background screens displaying images that counter act with the images up front,0
the mountains the woods and the river all look very beautiful,0
i could not take my eyes off this film for fear of missing something,0
funny stuff,1
tinkle 's book is listed as the source in both films but tinkle who was alive back then when the wayne film was done and he was not pleased with the resultbr br alec baldwin was around the right age for young william barrett travis the idealistic freedom fighter who incidentally was a slave owner,0
plus they did it as a serious comedy,1
the last two films were about the same but with different people having fun and fighting for what is right over their shouldersbr br some might say that this movie did nstime it 'll take some effort to get it across but it will be worth it to watch itbr,1
and it is quite scary but all in good ghoulish fun,0
if that doesn't scare anyone i ca just say it'scare me to death,1
the ending is almost comically contrived not unlike the ending in a real film,1
however when they have the same conversation there're a lot to work outbr br some people may find this an unnecessary movie and say that maybe that is what 'theodore bakshi'is about but when your idea is to get someone down on his knees in a very short scene like that you can do without it,1
evelyn begins to say repeatedly i am the red lady and kitty is the black lady,0
there are some films that every horror fan owes himself to see and emilio miraglia 's la dama rossa uccide sette volte aka,0
all in all a good idea with a good story good direction and good actors all overbrittany wong directs a solid script with welldone performances by both kim koo and ching su who also act together perfectly,1
it 's probably to do with the old basic theme of good versus evilbr br this film has a documentary style as we follow the difficult initiation of anne a raw recruit into a police squad stationed in the baltic area,0
raul julia was a wonderful stage actor,0
as he is a great dancer the two become friends as they dance,1
to this day the acting is so awful that i ca not even remember seeing it being done,1
the last scene where it is explained to me to be from an unseen man as a man 'who lived in the time of american slavery but was still living as an american,1
a woman kills her 2nd husband but runs into a problem when an escaped maniac in a ragged santa claus outfit decides to pay her and her little girl a visit at that very moment,0
the script and direction are excellent and you can actually feel the pain of the character and the struggles the characters go to overcome,1
our lead male characters can barely act,1
the film had a bit of a camp vibe throughout the film but nothing much more,1
the only reason i even found out about this dvd was because dominic monaghan is a favorite actor of mine,0
good work also by richard benjamin as the harried nephew rosetta lenoire as the nurse and howard hesseman as the tv commercial director,0
the last of the movie is a bit too long and doesn't really work at all in termssthe movie lacks a bit of action or excitement but has enough suspense and good scenes that you willn't mindbr br the movie could easily have ended on a good and a bit of fun,1
by far the best actor in the world i had to think about and judgebrant and pierce brooks was also quite funny as they were quite the pair here as wellbrick did a fine job in bringing the plot to lifebrick williamson did an okay and moving performance as the wise and resourceless friend,1
that said you ca n't decide when to stop being shocked and when to take this man home for a cuddle,0
tatum is killed and stewart is wounded,0
makes you wonder what a huge deal this is,1
i absolutely loved it,0
the movie was very interesting considering that i had the chance of watching it,1
but after reading the reviews on this site i just want to say that this is the best movie i have seen in a long timebr br as someone who grewup in the 70'ses there are things i love in this movie but the ones that stand on their own and add to the experience i really wish i had watched it when they came home to me,1
later when the boys try to fight with the mummies they kill them before he realizes they killed his family,1
shahid and amrita worked very well together and their relationship fitted their characters and they both did an excellent job,0
o my gosh just give me a minute to breath,0
the cat drops the fish into the bowl,0
charles dickens' story is captured in outstanding fashion here,0
after watching the movie it instantly became one of my favorites,0
william haines is his usual wonderful comedic self and there are cameos by charles chaplin john gilbert and other famous stars of the day including the director of the film king vidor,0
under the brush stroke direction of mike newell these actors accomplish vividly memorable performances that are photographed with a sublimely subtle painter 's eye,0
most of the films were bad,1
due to financial circumstances two other women join them,0
the director clearly didn't like this movie but as to the actual plot i can see why and how it is presented,1
the movie would have been worth a rent to be more entertaining and in fact more entertaining if not for some good acting and the fact that the movie takes its inspiration in a rather odd way,1
much like grosse pointe blank another hitman comedy the humour can be very dark,0
unfortunately the only good thing was the acting,1
as the first the humor just takes up too much space and this time around it 's even worse,0
bruno the cat with the dog has the most lines in the film for the worst amount of them i mean i love a good movie,1
mark ryan played his role brilliantly,1
how this movie was made is beyond me so many other things could have been saidbr br first of what would you expect,1
however if you 're looking for a fun way to spend two hours then go ahead and watch it,0
clive owen as molly is a little too nice even though she has a very small but vital part,1
for example the famed reunion scene could have been a lot duller with lessquality actors involved,0
this has to be number 1 this movie is not about how a man can be raped or killed,1
i also liked the acting of all others for ex,0
capable of turning out very good action movie fare the action and comedy scenes are also very good,1
br br so the key to interpreting europa almost a sequel of sorts to the element of crime is that we are deep in ourvon trier 's subconscious and the symbols there are to be interpreted within ourselves and will likely be different for everyone,0
his iberia suite is an imaginative synthesis of spanish folk music with the styles of liszt dukas and d'indy,0
also there were some other comments about the script that are not true,1
wish someone would do more ghost stories like these,0
april love is light and easy to watch a feel good movie,0
this is also one i would naeve enjoyed watching in a movie theatre,1
add to that solid directing flawless cinematography and faithful scripting we have here what will one day be considered a holiday classic,0
he and the entire cast truly show a true reverence for the star trek legacy,0
and we watch with bated breath as vadar and the emperor attempt to turn luke to the dark side while he in turn tries to turn his father backbr br but for me the most difficult and yet compelling battles is that going on inside darth vadar,0
it almost seems like a documentary of a time now pastbr br when hiphop was a way of life,0
and this is where the action startsbr br as he'ssomething'ses about going into the forest to kill those who aren't in there there it 'll get you killed,1
searingly shot and edited,1
i ca n't even form an accurate estimate at this point,0
are these people really supposed,1
if you take away a bit of the acting the sound quality and the fact it was shot on minidv then what are you left with,0
how can talent the likes of jones and duvall continue to produce such fine work in an age where actors pose for the digitizing,0
oh my,1
films of this period were all different and much less like this,1
cowboy is the best of the few cartoons ever madeand it've got a very good soundtrackit've got a bit more suspense in some partsand it has the funniest songs as well as some of christmas carol've more humor,1
another thing i really liked is that they did n't fall back on using blue screen backdrops during the horse racing sequences and they quite a bit more entertaining and exciting because of it,0
the characters are very realistic very human and the film even has some funny scenes such that this movie had a lot of laughs,1
davies leaves haines and partners up with the dashingly dramatic paul ralli,0
another necessary ingredient of a superior giallo is a catchy hummable score and bruno nicolai provides one for this film that should stay with you for days,0
br br and you get the picture how the film was designed,1
many people have complained about the lack of any coherent storyline,1
while the movie wasn't really anything special the acting and the storyline were nagged at the end,1
do n't miss this movie which should have won the oscar,0
the script is just plain silly i would recommend this movie only to people out for a night of fun,1
waif the film is the best thing that had just happened to her then it is amazing how the film is nosedive without any real plot and at the end i found it just a bit too painful to watchbr br i would be more surprised if they made a sequel,1
alex spends his days at cafs and restaurants,0
she seems to have a lot of her self respect,1
and the ending that will never be forgotten,1
i have always been frustrated in southern california but somehow got caught up in its materialistic society,0
thankfully the audience is given credit for being human beings our intelligence is not insulted by a sappy implausibly moralistic endingbr br above and beyond that i try to keep a clear head about movies being fiction and all that,0
so the script is not bad and the production values are quite good,1
it 's a roller coster of emotion and pain that the viewer takes on,0
since he doesn't like to be called a liar he does whatever is necessary to defend the truth and to make sure his job is secure and that he gets paid,1
shirly harold who turns up in this film gets an opportunity to play a cop,1
10 out of 10 and highly recommended,0
most people say i'm just being weird,1
this is an enjoyable watch for all ages however my wife and i like the movies of charles dickman,1
the movie has its tear jerking parts as well,0
for this they are casted and filmed with excellent support and are also a perfect choice to give a few lines of dialog that will resonate with the audiencebr br as the film unfolds we are left in the dark who the hell she really is and where she is going and when,1
imagine the power of michael douglas in his first director,1
that 's about itbr br it has the mystery element that scream made so popular in slasher movies but i never care for such things,0
the acting is also pretty awful as the main characters go through a rough year and a half of war,1
the one in the middle of a string to a car crash and the others being chased down,1
the movie is not very well acted and is not entirely realistic but it does manage a few parts the best is when kajol has no recollection of what went before or afterbr br it also has some funny moments especially when lindbergh sees the girl who was taken in by the evil priest and kip a little girl is left behind in the basement of the building,1
way too many of his films have been so poorly made that you are either waiting to cry or be amazed,1
the major points of the mystery are all there the petty thefts the boarding house the students the ripped rucksack and of course poirot 's ability to see something sinister going on before it actually happens,0
rosie is a woman of immense experience the man who was a major star in the 70'semi era and still is,1
they are so unbelievably awful that even a kid could care but somehow these are movies i cant even sit through and then i would still cry,1
few movies can be viewed almost 60 years later yet remain as engrossing as this one,0
br br the french conductor who can freeze time and people 's bodies obtrudes many of their key moments together lecturing peter about history and among his mischievous tricks pinching peter 's 'top 100 game tricks' book and his coffee cupbr br as visually inspired as other powellpressburger collaborations this was the first time they combined colour with bw the latter having a cheerful quality when used for the heaven scenes and both are equally captivating,0
br br in one scene in the movie we see a giant fish eating the human body,1
it're only natural that if it were namethe original idea behind the film was for a little girl to be sexually aroused by certain men at the time but as the film goes along it just drags down and is nastier,1
the anger and bitterness all culminate in a harrowing monologue by veronika delivered directly to the audience breaking down the coldly objective nature of the rest of the film,0
an average old lady living on the island finds out that her young grandson is also suffering from the same mysterious sickness that the doctor was giving her in the hospital,1
in some films you are required for an audience to make a choice when deciding what works for them as well what works for you,1
i still remember the 1st episode which was called the new house,0
when the shoes are polished a chalk mark is made on the soles,0
this film is more about the story than it is a history lesson but that'saute is an extremely beautiful movie for the entire family,1
if it had been made in the 60'scandinavia it would be a really good tv movie but sadly it is not,1
the director also used a very unusual style of filming that is unusual for this type of movie,1
it is not necessary to have seen this movie to understand the plot of this one,0
brilliance in the face not the least of which is the lack thereof at the beginning of any sequence,1
the amazing thing about the sunshine boys is how much it rubs your noses in willy 's almost existential condition without turning you off at all,0
he did a fabulous job,1
you can post on the board or send me a private email if you want,0
but this is just the tipoff,1
you know those movies when a film writer starts talking to his or her subject what is that,1
all this leads up to a very long and confusing battle with no resolution or explanation,1
however this time when she meets nina everything comes quite differentbr br the movie does not bring solutions not even partsolutions and insofar it is rather disappointing,0
regardless he gives her a small gift which is the ring and rings and a ring ring ring which is how she wants him when there is nothing she can do for the ring,1
the plot lines are pretty similar to 'goodfellas and the big fish which i found to be the worst,1
since the release of star wars episode i the phantom menace claims and counterclaims of just how episode 's ii and iii will eventuate has taken the spotlight off the 'original' star wars films making them part of a cohesive whole rather than segregating the older and new films into separate trilogies,0
matthau was brilliant but had the misfortune of being nominated against jack nicholson 's oscar winning performance of randall p macmurphy in one flew over the cuckoo 's nest,0
i was thinking how it will be possible to continue the story without helmer and drusse,0
marilyn kagan and kandice stroh are both very good as madge and deirdre and did what they had to do well as the other two friends,0
they were much too far away to pull them out alive from under the snow,0
never mind that someone else may get paul 's file later to supervise his release for the moment they are free,0
like most modern action films there were no special features,1
so the story has be rock solid with a good dash of suspended reality in order to make it work,0
ah from kubrick 's eyes wide shut 'got it just as i arrived at the door,0
and in my opinion james stewart gives as fine a performance as he ever did,0
this is a real masterpiece,0
yuen is very cool,1
as for the ending of what 'll happen to kristin at the end of the movie,1
europa is a great film a masterpiece,0
but if it wasn't this movie wasn't funny a,1
robert duvall 's performance was excellent and outstanding,0
then he suddenly appears lost in a storm lands on the island of the pheacians where the royal family takes good care of him,0
he does n't have a meaty role but serves to soften jeff 's hard edges,0
the first ten lines seem like a dreamscape of a movie and then the climax is a dreamscape all in the blink of an eye so you 'll have to watch it,1
they personalize perfectly the characters,0
and makes no mistake herebr br an excellent film all round,0
the major problem in this movie was that while cowboy actor james arness played the part of jim bowie persuasively the rest of the name actors in the cast brian keith and lorne greene were too oldbr br raul julia played general antonio lopez de santa anna with grace and dignity owed to the professional soldier who after all won the battle,0
the acting was nary terrible except for jimmy cagney,1
he did a wonderful job of making a character really come to life,0
brilliants a very well done film and one of my favorites too even though it was a bgrade film,1
have n't seen in her in a lot of things and she did her job very convincinglybr br if you 're into to tv mystery movies check this one out if you have a chance,0
brillat is pretty much the worst of the bunch,1
this movie deserves to be made into an anthology but not until then,1
however a friend suggested that if there were no other way to describe this film i would never have seen it,1
why the universal dvd uses a panandscan print instead of the widescreen print tcm uses is beyond me,0
but nina lost everything,0
over time they become romantically involved,0
but this role simply does fit him,0
evidently he sees something of himself in jeff repeatedly declaring that he 's going to like him,0
if you think whoopi goldberg 's work is about homer and eddie or hollywood squares think again,0
it 's an interesting adventure with the life of sunny davis who is arranged to marry the king of ohtar so that the us can get an army base there to balance power in the middle east,0
we all have a mountain of swords within us,0
there was one scene where we were watching and there were about two minutes before the end,1
ann rule is a fascinating storyteller of true crime,0
the whole movie is about the life of a young man named jason and his relationship with the church and his life with his parents,1
it starts out with jimmy stewart and walter brennan arriving in seattle and stewart is charged with murder,0
it is a good way of summarising the film and it is definitely not a masterpiece,1
at this stage as things progress they are not only losing sight of one one thing but are trying hard not to lose it in the future,1
what does it have to say about a person 'that has no soul and is nameless and no other soul than himselfbr br a character called lucienne has a heart of stone but she 'll stand up when his body has been exposed because she is one of his enemies,1
i rate this one 910,0
when you actually find a video game to be scary or disturbing you know that the developers have done some very serious and hard work to make the whole thing work,0
even so the film did have some amusing pointsbrained plotlines and a handful of memorable characters and i would rather watch a movie about vampires than a movie where it 'gets interesting that way and makes you more and more invested in this storybrilliar acting by kate mitchum the rest of this is a let down,1
yet what we have here are more or less two dozen movies of this genre with no other redeeming qualities whatsoeverbr br the problem is not that the movie is bad not that there're any redeeming factors,1
the character of rosie james is extremely flawed and her role isn't given any depth,1
not to mention he''ll be wearing a full white jacket,1
searching the internet and finally viewing this movie i am not alone,1
she will never make such a great movie as this,1
i had more fun watching the matador than almost any other film from 2005 it is a wacky film with an unforgettable character played to perfection by pierce brosnanbr br julian noble is a facilitator who specializes in highend corporate gigs,0
he're a very cool guy but if his character isn't on board this isn't his movie to show you,1
great director finishes his trilogy after 10 years using puppet animation,0
it comes out to buy on july 24th,0
there aren't too many of them though but the action is fairly well done,1
this movie has a lot to do with jeff it is 6 years later so you know he will be interested in girlsbr br i want to say that i have enjoyed all 4 movies so far was not crazy about the books cant wait until the next movie,0
i wished there were more martial arts action with fists and fist instead of battles with magical abilities but well that 's life and it never goes the way you want it to,0
br br the special effects were ok but just did nve made some of those things look like real life things,1
overall however a very good movie and a must see for the younger people of chicagobr,1
especially the dialogue and actingbrainedbrilliantbrad pitt,1
his acting style fits the role very well as the devious mischievous puss who seems to get his master into deeper and deeper trouble but in fact has a plan he 's thought about seven or eight moves in advance,0
typically the book is one of the best of its genre so the casting of ollie daly is top of the line,1
the movie has its moments but the acting is terrible and the ending is so unoriginal that i found it hard to believe that the writer of this movie intended as a good one,1
he 's a twentysomething pseudointellectual not with any seeming job and he lives off of a woman marie slightly older than him and is usually if not always his lover his last possible loveofhislife left him and then right away he picks up a woman he sees on the street veronika who perhaps reminds him of her,0
the scene where he upbraids his officers for failing to mount a guard and prevent a sortee is one the scriptwriters did not understand,0
this movie was not a classicbr br i'm not sure if it 'll be remembered as a masterpiece or just a bad attempt at nostalgia but i think it was a movie which was fun and fun to watch,1
what about the other three,1
further by establishing a type of breezy camaraderie between mcintire and stewart the film plays up the notion of how close in temperament they really are and so how far a moral distance stewart must walk by the end of the filmbr br i wo n't go through all the twists and turns the plot takes see those for yourself,0
this is definitely a move in the right directionbr br denise richards stands out here as a fun character,0
also the only good part of this film is the title,1
the absence of violence and sex was refreshing,0
as a result of such issues the film has been banned under the laws on child marriage,1
and it're almost as if his own movies had a little more of a story going for it,1
even now it can measure up to other movies in this genre,0
people who like the first half and its premise are in this one for sure but the rest could have been far worse,1
this will not likely be voted best comedy of the year a few too many coincidences and plot holes,0
i just read the comments of tomreynolds2004 and feel i have to jump in here,0
this was quite a coup and well ahead of its times,0
easiest thing one can think about as to why,1
although i still love this film in my eyes it 'll be a disappointment from the start,1
nice music soundtrack,1
not that this is a problem i mean there is no problem,1
oh yeah there 'll also another one and that 'll end itbrilliant,1

3 and 12 hours and worthing every minute,0
in watching how the two brothers interact and feed off of each other through the whole movie makes me personally happy to live in the rural area much like they did in the movie,0
unforgiven i felt that i saw it coming and i think the other reviewer mentioned some things that just weren't in order for the story to run,1
but that is not enough for the audience to feel the horror of what the film represents,1
br br both girls are in one amazing emotional scene after another without coming off as melodramatic,0
the only problem is that it'screwup at each turn because they did n've a bad story line,1
this story is told and retold and continues to be retold in every possibly way imagine,0
peter bogdonavich has made a handful of truly great films and they all laughed is one of his best,0
moreover in my opinion the best thing about this film is its great writing,1
when a discovery is made in paul 's apartment by carla i found myself deeply angry,0
there is also a great sense of humour in this filmbrigitte holland directs a superb picture at the same time as joel schumacher,1
the convoluted plot held my interest throughout,0
if you watch it expecting something more tongueincheek you may find yourself appreciating it a lot more,0
characters set the movie continuesbr br mcdowell 's character the headmistress arrives late at a funeral where a young organist filling in for the regular player catches her eye,0
only great acting could make this work without becoming an emotional quagmire sentimental and sappy,0

if there was a good reason to film this and why i wouldn't want the money i have right there,1
however we are talking about a movie where a hitman and a white bread salesman become buddies so a few vagaries should n't come as too much of a surprise,0
the acting by jason borkin is so bad its almost comical to watch,1
who thought they could make a movie about a gay gangster,1
the music and dialogue is so much better,1
turner is the first black actor i 'll ever see,1
anyone wanting to watch 'the joker'and 'the texas chain gang'should at best be prepared for this,1
the script is n't quite as good as could have been after maybe another rewrite,0
needless to say i was not disappointedbr br the film follows jack a insomniac who is often plagued by conditions which causes him to doubt what is reality and what is all in his head,0
not an easy movie by any stretch of the human mind,1
yet the end result is much better and enjoyable than most,1
after all who will drive the brand new suv and who will go to law school,0
otherwise it 'll be a wastebrannery would have been more suited to portraying a man who had to go through a time of great personal turmoil,1
when her character tries to 'act' its as though davies is poking fun at all the awful dramas she 'd been forced into and she 's brilliant doing itbr br while it 's true show people is a hokey satire of the 'good ole days' ten years hence it remains a highly entertaining example of quality work from mgm irving thalberg and their tremendous wealth of assembled talent,0
he gets peggy an acting job,0
not a perfect movie but fun in the best matine style,0
the emperor is a different kind of evil for this film less cunning than governor tarkin from star wars more deeply psychologically dark than anything else,0

rather risqu for 1931,0
cruise is very convincing,1
now comes this stunning portrayal of a rich girl who spurns breeding and convention in favor of mothering the tortured soul of the child of a man clearly in need of mothering,0
romance is the most enjoyable parts in the movie and all the supporting cast were superb,1
the cinemas were devoid of tragedy while the screens were filled with wide screen technicolor films in order to pry people away from the gray glare of the evil medium in a box called television,0
it was a great show i'm gonna miss it,0
crush provides a combination of drama humor and such irony that i find the english establish very well when it concerns matters of the heart,0
europe,0
what a strangely wonderful if sometimes slight and bulky bigbudget fantasy this is,0
this story is the ultimate in mystery suspense,1

the only one who is a bit too smart is roger ewing but the last two are equally as funny as that,1

this movie was very good and told the story of the beloved lucille ball very well,0
great cast with just fine acting,0

things don't go so well when the girl who works as the housekeeper decides to break away from him,1
the movie is in many ways a complete and utter disaster in terms of cinemagoing style and editing as wellbrittany murphy is one to see and is one of my favorite actresses to date,1

i love it,0
she even tempers the theatrical stiffness of the other actors' early talkie acting style,0
in today 's world of digital fabrication there is no computer than can replace the actor and writer,0
but i found the scene that took me through it to the whole film more interesting and disturbingbrilliant,1
but by the end of the film the audience comes to identify with her and accept her faults as human,0

you ca n't just start casting your fishing line and hope for the best,0
brosnan deals with loneliness and regret every day and though we do n't understand why kinnear is so lenient and accepting with brosnan continually interrupting his life it 's slowly understood that brosnan is salvaging kinnear from a more downtoearth version of his own feelings as a means of redemption,0
i ca n't believe this only has a 59 rating on here as it should be much higher in my opinion and it was funny seeing randy quaid in this type of role plus this is extremely well written and made as well,0
when john wayne filmed his alamo story he had built a complete alamo set in the town of brackettsville texas which is still there and quite the tourist attraction,0
another very good mann flick thanks to the fatherson combination of walter brennan and jimmy stewart,0
unprofessional unsure more distant from the feel of formal military service than found in any st series and that says a lotbr br the casual country music opening theme song heralds the journeys of a family rather than the adventures of an important large military vesselbr br enterprise looks to show us a mostly fun warmfuzzy exploration of human relationships rather than take us on a historic bold gritty highrick exploration of spacebr br i would have selected adrian paul to play the captain and an older human to be the doctor,0
it 'll make a great show for everyone,1
the main problem is the plot,1
like no money was spent on this film and it still blew me away,0
better late than ever,1
the second is that this film is very entertaining,1
this movie is so bad it 'll make you nauseous in the bath afterwards if you watch this for the second time in the morning,1
good acting and not over the top,0
even diehard curly fans will enjoy this one,0
the movie has no plot,1
this is the worst movie ever made in my experiencebr br this one has no redeemive redeeming qualities whatsoeverbrbr it feels like a cartoon filmbrags about stupid people who never actually have to make mistakes to try and get some satisfaction out of it all,1
showing us that the film makers were not really trying at all to impress with the special effects,1
br br the ending is a major revelation,1
the film will have you asking yourself 'what if,1
there'are some good action scenes but the rest of the movie is just horriblebr br 1,1
though she 's a success in comedy what she wants to do is make art so she moves up to high arts studio,0
thank to a lot for the good reviews and because the movie was so good i thought the film would make a great tv movie which it wasbr br the story is like the old days with the old times it is not an average movie but rather one that tries to be something different,1

doesn't it,1
to do a good job and to have a sense that if the actors do it better and more intelligibly than what this movie is supposed to portray,1
the script is a mess and does not offer much in the way that some of the other 'horror films do,1
i hope that people will watch this movie and learn about important times in history like this one,0
people growing and people fading people surprising and people disappointing,0
at the time of his death,1
chamberlain is having strange dreams and he is somehow the key to what 's happening although no matter how many times i 've seen this i ca n't quite grasp the exact connection,0

he is a bad man but he is not in trouble,1

the soundtrack is great with creepy music and some fine alternative tunesbr br lowpoint i felt as though the killer was n't featured enough we barely saw the mask and it was n't featured at all during the climax,0
i especially loved josie lawrence as lottie wilkins but every lead and supporting actor is flawless in this film,0
18 is definitely a movie to watch if not on a big screen,1
why,1
they are so good,1
two of those actors in this show were actually actors in a movie and that movie is also one in which they are actually doing some of their worst acting ever,1
i look forward to more of richard shepard 's projects,0

i'm sure that not many people outside of australia have ever heard of the legend of ned kelly,0
the dialogue is so badly done and so stupid you have the feeling you're reading an idiot book by a bad writer,1
this movie is an excellent one to watch on your own and enjoy yourself for a nice break in the movie,1
the dialogue seems to come out at random from time to one and it often appears the filmmakers simply took a cue from the actual events,1
their hope dwindles and they are down to their last 40 cents when they meet billy boone who works at the slapstick studios and promises to get peggy a job,0
taken as a film this one is pretty good and it 's especially important for marking the celebrity of the director peter weir and the australian film industry,0
this is one movie in my opinion,1
whereas his character michael is a lovable villain you have dudikoff,1
you have the most talented cast in the history but they do not act,1
nina is just a nia a girl without name there is no hope for any divine fulfillment,0
it 's also revealed to david that he himself has some kind of spiritual connection with the austrailan aborigines as both charlie and his stepfather rev,0

some things were so funny and fun i wanted the dvd to be burned,1
yes there are some minor on screen glitches with two of the ghosts that visit scrooge but there is n't a movie in existence that does n't have at least a couple of mistakesbr br scott turns in a stellar performance as scrooge he 's a pleasure to watch,0
and i thank all involved including the creator irving pinkus for having brought it to my family,0
and that was the movie,1
in fact most of it was just recycled,1
the narration is almost hypnotizing and from the opening lines it is impossible to turn away,0
how did they end up with this terrible storyline,1
the only character who really does anything to get the girl was dorotheosha 'br br overall the movie was too long too boring too bad it was only 20 min,1

beowolves were not very scary so it did nate all the horror elements of the movie,1
br br the young boy has befriended yokai which are monsters of a kind mostly benign that have isolated themselves away from humans and all the yokai in japan band together to fight the evilbr br in many ways miike crew have taken the late 60 'searly 70 's yokai films and turned them into a modern action adventure film for kids that also combines some strange mechanical monsters that made me think of transformers,0
it'ves been my experience of playing this game a few times since my senior school days and it is as enjoyable to play as it is to play it on any other kindbrilliar is probably the worst title that i have ever seen,1
one of marion 's funniest bits often excerpted elsewhere is her audition at the comet studio casting office,0
so i hope fans will stop comparing thembr br and if you can relate to either abby jack natalie cooper or even nate you 'll like this show,0
for this and a few other films it 'll seem too much and the audience becomes bored and a little confused,1
wow,0
scenes with tom savatrice and jake brennan are excellent in addition as are these scenes with david keith,1
and that is pretty sad specially if you consider that almost all the time the worst shows are still on air i admit that are many similarities with this show and the simpsons but despite the similarities the show have it own merits,0
run away you little dog run away,1
in spite of what first impressions may give it is n't cheesy corny tacky or ridiculous and is actually highly entertaining and funny,0

one could argue that the definitive portrayal of scrooge one of the best known characters in literary fiction ever was created by alastair sim in the 1951 film but i think with his performance here scott has now achieved that distinction,0
great music great acting great script very very good storybr br br br i give it 710 for that reason alone the best movie for a girl who loves to watch naked in bed with guys,1
nor is this film any more effective at conveishing a plot than any of the other slasher flicks in the genre,1
this is one of the best movies,0
george burns did a great job,0
the special effects are also a little stiff which makes the film seem a couple of days long in comparison to the others,1
it does not take a genius to realise that the film'resolves the dilemma of what to do in life by making a simple and unpretentatious decision which makes the viewer feel like the entire movie is a success,1
yeah we've seen that before but we 'll have come much much earlier,1
the soldiers are sent to the front to fight in the mainland while another kind of war happens at home on the small island,0
she 's isolated,0
br br when they meet they are introduced to the strange people at a local restaurant and the couple are having lunch and begin talking,1
without doubt the best comedy film ever and that includes the three stoogesbr br if anyone needs more info about how a film like alexander keller or kurt maclean got so many awards it'starts out with a lot of potential and this film has it all including tons more than one would want to see,1
some scenes were so painful to sit thru i knew i was in danger of getting killed,1
for those out there that hated scream there is not one reference to the horror rules in this movie,0
filmed largely in wurzburg germany the picture is a treat for the eye indeed,0
perhaps the fact that it was very very late and at the end of a 4 hour movie marathon or maybe it was because it really is a little slow i found this story difficult to follow,0
but the final cut is just plain dreadful a bad film with a bad ending,1
the film is more of a romance about war in italianamerican and how they deal with each other,1
made me laugh made me sad,0
the best part is that the whole time you are playing it you are really jumpy and afraid of what might lurk around the next corner or what might jump out behind you,0
all the while yellow acts as a personal documentary exploring lena 's life her home life her loves her political views her view of herself,0
the movie shows some of walt disenchants that he has at his very best and the movie is great,1
this director really knows what she 's doing,0
how come it is n't more well known,0
in particular the characters are all clich and stereotypical,1
the plot is a bit hard to follow,0
aunt henrietta is hoping that nick being on the farm will somehow bring jed out of his doldrums,0
i have seen so many bad low budget films lately but this one is great,0
the acting was awful and a very predictable piece of garbagebr br there was no reason why i put this film up in order,1
the scenery is incredibly beautiful of the mountains and streams of western montana,0
i'm excited for the phantom menace because it will suddenly throw the focus of the whole story from luke to anakin,0
it 's truly a fun movie to watch but is it too weirdbr br now the down side is people will definitely get confused with it 's broad story line shortened down into a 95 minute movie,0
this is because i have never seen a film that deals so effectively with a story but this one is certainly better than thisbr br it has a good plot and it does n 'feel like a movie and a movie is still fun to watch,1
that is when you can easily be taken seriouslybrilliant and touching film,1
why did they have to make a sequel to this mess,1
even so the film did not succeed to entertain at all,1
she was just beautiful,1
the immortal charles dicken 's story has been recreated in every possible way imagine,0
there 'll always be a story to tell,1
i do not like family films,0
ben stiller made quite good films from the 60'thefirst,1
while drinking puke is n't really my thing as far as a substantial entertainment show goes dirty sanchez is way out of jackass 's league,0
br br it 'll take a good director to do it justice though and it sure beats the likes the classic '80'sept of dawn '80 '81 '84 and '92 movies,1
raul julia magnificently carried poor writing through the scenebr br kathleen york was an impressive susannah dickinson a woman who deserves to be remembered for her courage,0
although i have watched this movie about 40 of it have i never seen such utter stupidity as the movie itself,1
the director of this story is the same guy behind the '50'slip stalker'and i'm sure that this is his weakest film,1
not only does kim keaton have to keep an eye peeled it 'll have an interesting twist ending for the movie,1
the character of alexander was nicked and left out by the writers who did this film in the first place,1
one is the straight man and the other is the persistent fool who gets them into trouble,0
and he could have pulled it off,1
not many,0
certainly the role does n't require much depth but still it 's a nicely done job when you would least expect it,0
i guess the year 2001 is going to finally give horror fans the kind of movies they were longing for,0
but the thing that made it so special was the music,1
this was a film of great drama and suspense and one that could easily stand the high quality test for such a lowbudget flick like this,1
the most entrancing points in the movie are the entirely cinematographic ones,0
henry quinn had many films to make from this period but none of these movies had the potential to be greatbrittany murphy '70 film that is worth seeing is the love story and the film the film the story of love,1
they are both terrific 1950s horror films,0
this is mostly for kids who will probably find it silly but fun,0
sometimes it is hard to tell if the original is a true story,1
this isn't a great movie and a lot of the music was pretty lame but it made up for that in the long run,1
crucially in the movie this guy played by john woo himself who was also very good in the movie is killed off in a very cheap way but he're still cool,1
return of the jedi has all the ingredients necessary to provide the ending lucas masterpiece deserves,0
and what after life,0
and to top it all off this movie was made back when rko was on the set,1
the scene where she is running around in a snow covered desert and falling down is one of my favorite scenes and is a testament both to the film 'art direction music and characters,1
interesting,1
check him on screen,1
on a personal note i wasn't really expecting this very much at all,1
my parents said i would cry when i was supposed to be happy and would be happy when i was supposed to cry,0
one piece of inside information we did not get was whether or not kathy nolan regretted quitting the show in an unpleasant contract dispute which left luke a widow in it 's last year which was n't very good,0
at a certain moment you can see how he 'll kill them all,1
also while i say this movie is a comedy it does n't forget it has a heart at times and can be very touching when it needs to be,0
the characters are interesting the dialogue fascinating the atmosphere compelling even the plot very well crafted and so on,1
as such i recommend watching it,1
because of that mary is just so innocent even though her lover and fellow woman get into trouble when the man is accused,1
i have the record and the cd but i would love to buy a dvd version of this show,0
broadway producer john lonchock gave us his first true live performance in a feature film in which roberts played the head cop and roberting is played the supporting role by katherine hepman but hepmans is not seen until laterbr br as roberting 'father figure his character is one that many of his contemporaries would probably love to watch if they could take turns as his brother,1
but it've got more depth than that to me and a lot more wit,1
this movie is truly a disappointment,1
the way she does it has a lot of merit,1
this film was the movie of a decade ago in the late 1960'seal films of the late 1970 and early mid 1980'and they were all so good,1
after that we jump about 10 years to an hospital where the 3 friends meet againbr br religion sickness love violence and sexuality rage throughout the movie creating and intense and tensionfilled moviebr br i see people complaining about the film being too gory and i think they missed the point of the story,0
if you want to have a good laugh rent this show just because it're funny,1
a lot can be said about lars von trier but he is very diverse and pretty eccentric,0
one scene especially is imprinted on my brainbr br i also watched the similar movie lilja 4ever,0
the best scene is the closing scene,1
i understand he does n't like the film but his reasons are not evident,0
too bad they could n't have picked jeri ryan,0
this is the best of all the hiphopbreakbr br dancing movies that came out around that period,0
and they all leave,0
this new guy is something else entirely,0
the first 15 mins are filled with slow motion and it is a painful experience,1
for some reason leonard maltin panned this film i think it 's a lot better than he gave it credit,0
that 's fine by me,0
he does have a point that the film is a bit melodic sometimes though it does nudge a little too close and you can really feel his character as being in needof an injection,1
what,0
unfortunately jean eustache belongs like so many once leading french film makers nowadays to the great unknown ones whose movies are hard to find and are not released on international dvds,0
the movie 'll keep your attention and the movie 'll have a lot of laughs and then i think one day something funny comes along and it just might make me want it too bratty and pretentious it may be,1
fine casting especially the choice of scott who plays the role to the hilt a fine cast supports him in the very good adaption,0
you start out in a big mansion with all sorts of hiddensecret rooms and even a hidden hell dimension called oneiros,0
raps aren't the reason and he has to learn how not to shoot,1
decent direction by mack jacob,1
still i really enjoyed the idea and the ending,1
scenes that don't really work are not at all exciting or engaging,1
charles and jesse have a very good chemistry,1
maybe a masterpiece,0
actually it was a little too good for it 'cause there were so many other things wrong with the movie to take to the extreme but this really helped put it into that categorybragbr 1,1
i have decided to buy the dvd box of the first season and this first episode surprised me,0
this will be sure to keep you glued to the screen,0
very few chess movies have been made over the last couple of years but this one is more than just a chess movie its a story about the need to be loved and the need to win itjohn toturro plays a psychologically challenged man nothing matters to him accept 64 squares and 32 pieces the game validates him as a person when he looses a game he looses the one thing that makes sense to him and john torturro expresses this in a beautiful fashioneven the love of a woman was not enough to save him from his sad existenceit makes you wonder if there other luzon 's out there who obsess about the gamei am sure they areif you are a chess enthusiast it wo n't hurt to watch itits an intelligent piece of work laid out properly and executed wellit achieves its objectivesunfortunately i doubt if there will be sequel,0
near the end there may very well appear to really have just been a few hours in the film,1
this movie is one for you,1
europa is a neverending nightmare,0
still this is an enjoyable watch,1
every 'odyssey' i 've seen since has been an enormous letdown,0
let''its come from the top,1
the cast is pretty bland so to speak and the film was pretty boringbrad pitt could nad pett could only act in the role he was in and if that is so it was all of his,1
to begin with it 's hard to go wrong with barbara bouchet and marina malfatti in the same giallo,0
barker is good at what he does which is attach the horror to our world and it shows as his hand is clearly everywhere in this game,0
the best thing this show ever put together is its animationbr br this show is great from start to the end,1
how much worse would it have gone,1
put another way it was so bad that people still found time to watch it the second time i heard about it,1
oh and can he become the chess champion also,0
as another writer here mentioned it is curious that lydia reed and michael winkelman were n't refered to but perhaps they can be tracked down via sag or aftrabr br the reunion show was well done and gave us many unknown insights into the show,0
lots of tight expressionistic camera work an equally tight script and two superb actors all meld together to make one very fine piece of film,0
he has to fight the demons from the past so he doesn't have a way of knowing this time and he has a very good time,1
a long time ago in a galaxy far far away there was a boy who was only two years old when the original star wars film was released,0
br br the plot is simple at first,1
in my opinion the third series is the best but trust me when i say if you have a week stomach do not watch as you are lightly to see a fair amount of blood and puke in every episode,0
what begins as a perfect crime begins a struggle to survive as a deranged santa clause suit wearing psychopath threatens her life as well as her precious young daughtersbr br this episode is warmly remembered by even those casually acquainted with the program,0
you can't watch this because it 'll be boring to sit up too long waiting until it 'll end brat boy is all i want to talk about in here,1
geez if you liked the matrix you may like this movie,1
every so frequently she makes a movie out of the past that is so ridiculous and absurd that it gets to the level that it would be impossible not to get into,1
takashi miike is one of my favorite directors and i was worried about him doing a kids film because i would hate to see him depart from his films i came to love visitor q gozu izo ichi the killer and black socioty trilogy,0
were the movie writers really to fall for her or was it just the script that made the movie so badbr br the most disappointing thing for anyone who 'll rent the dvd is that they 'probably could have done with a bit more of an actual story or even a more elaborate script,1
br br it was very funny as the people involved with this and other similar movies,1
needless to say the technology of moviemaking has changed vastly since the silent days but the pretensions and follies of the filmmakers themselves have n't changed all that muchbr br show people also stands as the best surviving work of marion davies a firstrate comic performer who deserves a prominent place in the pantheon of great comediennes,0
rather than attempting to portray a ned kelly who is as unfeeling as the armour he wore the film quickly establishes him as a human being,0
what was explored was done well for the most part,0
if you do not like the movie then you will watch the sequel,1
the first part of the movie is really the movie'sandler ',1
but then again that 'll put it on the backburner as much as the most recent movie about this subject and it is definitely the same way it 'thinks it sees thingsbrat of the two main characters are a group known for being the worst gangster in town,1
awful,1
some scenes are very violent and very disturbing but this is nothing new,1
the fast and furious stick fight between sammo and lau kar leung is a model of dazzling choreography and sharp superb direction and easily one of the best ever of its type,0
along with ronda she nurses him back to health after jeff is left for dead by gannon 's gunslingers at his gold claim,0
matthau and burns work excellently together the contrast they portray accentuates simon 's superb knack at creating comedic conflict,0
the film rightly contains a scene where a multitude of different races confess i am an american as peter is judged by abraham farlan an anglophobe who was the first revolutionary killed by british forces in the american war of independence,0
of course thebr br 80 's are considered a joke now with all the bad tv shows andbr br movies but those of us who lived through it will always rememberbr br it fondly for a time when music dancing and graffiti were fresh yo,0
learn from the mistakes of other horror films,1
good ghost stories of bumps in the night voices that cannot be explained,0
if this station stays totally constructed it will be the end of the rebel alliance,0
mercedes carol who plays the mother had great chemistry with this filmbrittany heinrich who did n'reilly kier is a great actress in love story,1
they were all so unimpressingbr br what you can do when you work through a movie is look forward,1
anyway there is one thing good about the show that makes the show great,1
one of the most compelling performances i've seen from a cast of over 15 i was surprised how well dante managed as a character to overcome his selfimposed isolation while still letting us see what happened to himbr br overall i'm not a big fan by comparison,1
completely possible,0
all the characters are wonderful and the story is just brilliant plus jodie foster and cherie currie are simply amazing in this,0
it makes you wonder why there are so many britney films of the 1970 years,1
this movie is bad in the least,1
there are few films that leave me with the feeling that gregor jordan 's 'ned kelly' film did,0
because that 'll make it a classic movie for the most diehard europeanyway hollywood fans like me the reason why hmm this movie has stayed so popular among the masses for this long and the reason for its success is because it is a very very realistic one at the same time very intelligent,1
it 's a movie people,0
of course walter brennan was great as well as tony martnez,0
her acting was just fine if not perfect,1
and then i remembered to fast forward and to fast watch that it was about a gang of thugs who were trying their best in this war,1
that scene is worth seeing,1
the movie shows the importance to the lives for the whole people,1
the fact that he has made several short films is really a good signbr br when i first heard there were no more michael jackie movies on the air it was one long night when i decided i had to get something else,1
when she finds happiness through prem you want her to stay happy and also hope nothing goes wrong because the character is shown as a sweet simple girl,0
and whoopass was the director himself,1
previous comments also contain spoilers herebr br i watched this movie on monday night and i have only seen half of my life,1
it is my understanding that little luke had passed away in 1999 but i'm not sure how,0
the acting is okay but the direction is pretty lamebragas,1
his name was not even mentioned anywhere in the movie you had to go to the credits to find out bobba fett 's name,0
with jimmy 's unit pinned down by a german machine gun nest he single handedly put it out of commission picking off some half dozen german soldiers from the safety of a nearby church steeple,0
the ending successfully weaves all 6 chapters into a wonderful tale of fantasy,0
the ending was too abrupt the dialog was too long and there had to was too much talk,1
it was funny too with the two main characters and the movie and some other bits,1
my wife and i own a copy of this film on vhs and we watch it together every christmas eve,0
because scott displays such gleeful ferocity throughout the movie it proves infectious,0
well worth seeing,0
that is definitely so not true and very very sadbr br anyway what was shown here in lucy was pretty good,0
in a time when all the newest comedies are crude juvenile and stupid this leans back towards the tender core of what comedy really isfunny characters smart and funny dialogue and grand entertainmentbr br one of the best buddy comedies of all time right up there with planes trains and automobiles lethal weapon and the hard way,0
this was readily apparent with the release early in 2002 of l'emploi du temps a brilliant character study of of a white collar worker 's descent into melancholy after having been fired from his job,0
it was an excellent start to their career it certainly helped make them a great star of the era,1
the story takes a few unexpected turns and keeps the viewer constantly guessing where it 's gonna go nextbr br nice artistic touches from the director such as good use of music clever editing and somewhat unorthodox cinematography at times set a nice tone for the film and for a long period of time you do n't quite know how to label the film,0
cole 'the man with a gun for the lady in love with him and the one thing that you never see coming is the ending where kate comes back with the same man she killed the night of that nightbr br it has to have some interesting moments that have some impact in your mind about how we can handle one of the greatest serial killings ever,1
but i decided to check it out for one reason the fact that the story evolves around a sunken wwii german submarine,0
these guys are twinsbr br as i watched i wondered why some of the actors had foreign accents and what were they doing in this small town,0
add to it the plot the lack thereof a really bad ending a plot like that that would make someone say i do nothing but watch the fiftieth anniversary tv show or even dvd,1
by the way this is the second time in the series that the actors play the same part,1
luke skywalker now a jedi knight returns from tatooine with han solo and princess leia now revealed as luke 's twin sister,0
and how predictable,0
his trademarks include subtle deaththreats disguised as valentine cards maggotinfested chocolates and a bleeding nose,0
the movie has the look that we 'll always have in our minds and when we see it again we're not surprised at all,1
whether the actors are talented actors or actresses is irrelevant,1
busy phillips put in one hell of a performance both comedic and dramatic,0
and one gets married to a much older man,0
naschy and japan '68 is the only one on the film to really capture the emotional depth and depth of those two sisters in their respective roles,1
it 'll leave you breathless,1
i'm sure that 3rd part without helmer would n't be the same,0
that 's not to say i think its art and the plot is as pointless as can be,0
in a world of constant conflict the world that seems so peaceful can be very dangerous,1
now you can find the original film for free anywhere,1
watch it,0
it've been a long time since i have seen so many low grade zombie movies but when there is a sequel with such great results as the new one or a sequel with so many new characters then it just doesn't work,1
i must have seen this film more times than any other and i never tire of it,0
i 've dated guys like that,0
none of today 's movies will be sought out in 7 months let alone 70 years,0
both the female and male characters in this film could have easily have become a real person,1
there were too few surprises,1
this movie did n've me in the mood,1
but the other actors played their parts wonderfully also,0
ariel has to face another man who would put him to death and to get his son back,1
in a river runs through it redford displays the lyric romanticism and visual splendor of the high rocky mountains of montana as if he were a 19th century landscape painter of the ilk of thomas moran or albert bierstadt,0
it 's something beautiful in this movie something impressive which i cannot contradict using any moral or society rulesbr br the movie focuses mostly on relation between kiki and alex,0
brilliance on both sides of a conflict,1
left alone with the man with a knife the film loses a considerable plot,1
his brilliance is unquestioned but his obsession with chess has stunted his growth in all other aspects of his life,0
they have had puking eating pubescovered pizza jumping in stinging nettles naked paint balling jokes on the smaller guy while heavily sleepingsnoring stunts in a work place eg,0
but the train is able to stop in time because someone warns them and what will follow is a battle on life and death between the police and the four gunmen br br it 's very hard to tell whether all of what is shown in the movie is true or false,0
movie for the whole mind it're a big waste of time,1
the format is a knockout which actually the world governing body of fide has sometimes employed as a format itself going from 128 players to just 2 in the final,0
this is a very good movie from writerproducerwriter joanne heminglin,1
rockstead has one of the hardest jobs of any director,1
then this meritorious film will become another spectacular movie that will be the subject of derision like rotj suffered unfortunatelybr br,0
you are missing out one of the saddest yet complicated murder of all,0
the story outline is similar to hahk light hearted in the beginning to serious mode at the end,0
a great children 's story and very likable characters,0
one of the girls is alicia a teenage reble who is the only witness for the full attack and another is deanna another survivor who survived a bullet to the head by some miracle,0
for the most part it has nothing to do with this movie it're just about a bunch of weird teenagers fighting in the woods,1
this movie is just a bunch,1
brosnan may be cinema 's ultimate charmer but this is his most endearing and complete performance to date,0
the same applies to neal burns who uses worms as bait he also needed help but would not accept the fact that he needed help,0
for it've been too long and you still have too many times to spend time with the dialog,1
with a superb cast and a glorious soundtrack this movie full of selfconsciousness and compassion and far away from selfindulgence and emptiness deserves a better place on the history of american cinema than where it have been placed,0
the movie seems to end quickly leaving things somewhat unresolved,0
eventually honesty trust are the keywords that he reflects in his first talk with amrita,0
it 's tragic and you know she 's going to end up very hurt but there 's nothing you can do,0
this is an excellent example of a film that has got everything so well put to excellent effect and is also one that anyone can make fun of for many years afterwards,1
stupid,1
coming from one that had worked so well with other recent films like karate kid i was expecting something different at first but really the cast and the overall story were quite good,1
it has the capacity to draw you in to enthrall you to capture you as the history of the family community and period is unfolded,0
jenny hanahan,0
still it may be worth watching for a good laugh,1
the special effects were incredible,0
orlando bloom and naomi watts were also really good and believable,0
i think that the director writer should write more movies like this one,0
to add to her misery the whole point is not so much to get rid from her but to find out what happens to the person who has been there the most,1
the other actors were also on point,1
this movie really is nada if you ask me,1
scream was also not the only movie to feature a masked killer in it,0
but when we were asked to rewatch it a second time to see if it was still in a state of limbo i really didn't care anymorebrilliance,1
catching and examining that disparity between law and disorder in the main character himself is i believe the highest and truest goal of any western,0
ok this film is a good movie but it 'll be a lot worse that the first,1
it was one of the best filmgoing experiences i have ever hadbr br br br,0
brad gaffey was fantastic in this one,1
at times he despairs at being pushed by the film crew to make the emotional journey back especially considering his age and physical frailty,0
perhaps the arab community would be less than thrilled with this work but for those who like to laugh rent this today,0
richard chamberlain is david burton a tax lawyer living in sydney australia who is drawn into a murder trial defending five aboriginal men accused of murdering a fellow native in peter weir 's apocalyptic 1977 thriller the last wave,0
at one point in her life they had a big fight and they all got shot,1
all in the name for money in the sense that it 'll take a fortune for a single film crew at the expense of their livesbr br the acting is below what other directors could do in such an australian production,1
there are some funny moments involving some of these guys but they do not carry the movie,1
there've always been some kind of romantic relationship that is very important in the movie but with this i found it very lacking,1
as for julie anne she was really wasted in the film she is the least interesting and she is wasted on this nonsense which made her look really bad in the filmbr br if you loved the first version of this movie you will love this sequelbr br all i can add to it is the fact that they did a better job with the characters but not that horrible,1
after a couple of minutes you start thinking the movie is over,1
br br you may have a hard time finding this for rent or on tv but trust me it will be worth your timebr br 455 starsbr br john ulmer,0
in my opinion this movie is very light entertainment but has some classic characters,0
br br,1
seldom are they home because instant gratification is a pill party or boy awaybr br but rather than condemning them the film is sympathetic blaming absent uncaring adults for forcing the teens to grow up alone,0
br br if you thought films like before sunrisesunset were talky relationship flicks you have n't met this,0
i get that they have to film half speed to avoid hurting each other but there are smooth edits and then there 's this,0
wow to think that a christmas cd would be worth that much,0
may be worth your while to watch it just in time if i 'll ever get a chancebr ps the other reviewers seem pretty positive,1
and no his part is n't big at all it 's very short at the very end of the film it 's not a big part which makes me believe thats why people hate the film,0
br br so a bad joke or bad movie just is nigh the worst the kind of joke has been doing so many times since the first,1
but over all i loved it left me with the same feeling the others did please do n't be over,0
he claims for instance that he loves a woman for parallel reasons because she played in a bresson 's for example,0
and in this film she plays the fascist ms togar with sneering relish,0
whatever the case i loved this film,1
by this stage he was no londoner and she was probably too embarrassed by it by the opening credits,1
in the far country stewart 's jeff webster by not getting involved to help anyone else gets to see essentially the same thing a world in which he does n't existbr br by not getting involved webster is forced to see those for whom he ca n't help but care get hurt pushed around and even killed while he stands by and does nothing,0
maclean did in his church,0
ok,1
if you like the good stuff see this one and make a copy,1
someone had given a few names to my grandmother and aunt for her mother,1
the story line is thin and unconvoluted and the acting weak from everyone involved,1
there will be lots of women crying at the end of the film,0
romantic sweet yummybr br hawn is a goofy cocktail waitress who saves a foreign man and ends up at the whitehouse in the middle of a plot due to the greed of politicians,0
it're still about a young man who is not ready to let go of his father 'cause by then it seems that he is the only one left alive,1
so as we get into this movie we're treated by some of the best and best cast ever made,1
if they didn't see it that was the worst movie i've ever seen before,1
a twist occurs in this movie which is really good the last 30mins you all will be reaching for the tissue boxbr br what makes this film so amazing is the chemistry between prem and poonam how they fall for each other is too sweet,0
i thought i will never be enamored by anyone 's beauty after madhuri and early kajol but she completely changed that,0
at this point the film takes a back seat to the book,1
and the supporting performances are universally fantastic,0
br br full of great hollywood location footage both on the set and off,0
quite frankly it 's a bit different,0
because there are so many good ideas here the plot gets pretty thin but it 'll get better as the film progressesbr br if you want a good horror movie about a bunch a couple having lots go and a little sleep try the danish ghost town the night before,1
they're all just sooo bad,1
why the ending works is some combination of the audience need for a reward at the end of this kind of journey the song he goes out on and the amazing editing of the final minutebr br the other strength of the film is the casting of busy phillips and erika christensen as the main protagonists,0
absolutely the greatest show ever createdbrigot is hilarious and the animation is simply breathtaking but this is actually an excellent show,1
what can i do for you,1
she'res a very smart woman who does everything she can to find her own place in the lives her two men lead,1
most of his movies never really hit home the emotional drama the tension the suspense and the overall mood of each scenebrbr i'm giving this a 3 stars but i think he did not care,1
the gaping nonthreatening sarlaac 's mouth was given moving tentacles and a huge flytrap looking head that emerged which definitely added to the suspense,0
i think you have to slide it,0
this is the type of film you either love or hate which is why i believe a lot of mix reviews and not that greatest success resulted when this film was released,0
this should be on the list,1
all he did it for was a couple of hours in order and that was enough to get you interested in the film,1
there is n't a strong message from this film but its a good watch,0
it 'll probably be a pretty good thriller but the real message has to do with relationships,1
the literary genius of vladimir navokov is brought to the screen again and many in the cultured world will take notice,0
a rather morbid tale one might think but it is classic charles dickens and also one of the most famous and popular christmas stories of all timebr br to me this is the definitive version of dickens' timeless story it 's the one i always remember watching in school and i remember being absolutely terrified by it,0
the language of fantasybr br tristan ventures out of a rather twee english village called wall,0
the two children represent ignorance and need br br criticisms for me however become apparent having watched it again with more objective and trained eyes the main one of which being that george c scott 's portrayal of scrooge seems simply not cold enough,0
but i do hope she does n've noticed so much in what she is doing than maybe it 'll turn her off,1
britton has the same problems we have with the other series of the franchise,1
this is one of the best movies to come from bollywood in years,0

the music was terrible and they sounded like a group that've only been together one year,1
this might require a bit of patience especially since neither is attractive in the typical hollywood definition of such,0
you got to love thatbr br it has a very nice atmosphere and really does get a lot of laughs as it does,1
the other characters are n't given much to do but this film does offer something new in that respect it almost effortlessly succeeds in blending all conventional genres into quite an entertaining spoof,0
the simple walking away symbolizing that nothing has changed can be a strong effect of dramaturgy but in gespenster it is displacedbr br since critics have been suggesting freudian motives in this movie let me give my own attempt why is it that similar persons do not know one another especially not the persons that another similar person knows,0
it 'll probably be a pretty long long run,1
although the film basically implies that cook was essentially the woman in ned kelly 's life but you would not know that from the minimal screen time that she gets here,0
it makes me smile it makes me laugh it makes me think it makes me cry,0
what is very french about this film is the time taken to establish the two leading characters,0
the fact is the show is not the greatest show in the world but it does have great potential,1
also the ending is one of many that would have disappointed me a lot if it were not for its very silly and very poor writing and directionbr br the best thing i could say is about the fact its good,1
there are more twists but they were not that bad,1
in punishment gannon takes the partners herd from them but they steal them back and head across the canadian border to dawsonwith gannon and his men in hot pursuit,0
some classy and tasteful nudity perhaps,0
played brilliantly by ian mcdiarmid the emperor is just one of those characters you love to hatebr br all the other actors are well entrenched in their roles,0
i was very surprised how much i enjoyed this film,0
john mcintyre does a bangup job as a corrupt judgeentrepreneurthief,0
even in this movie he was a jerk i mean he was not even the slightest bit likish,1

are they going on to be able get rid of these nasty creatures for a living before they die,1
and there were some hilarious moments in here and there as i've noted it'seems like the director'ssuedit has spent a good chunk of time filming his own films but i'm not sure what it'seems like,1
several times the show was preempted for an extra halfhour of such dreck as the biggest loser,0
first off this is nastassia kapur a young youngish woman of about 30,1
another of her best performances,1
maybe this is how the director knew how to use his camera and to convey a realistic feel of the worldbr br for a movie like this it does little to satisfy,1
what went wrong,0

ben gazzara has never been better and colleen camp has one of her best roles as the manic country singer christy miller,0
okay so the goofie foreign guy who trades with the biker for his clothes was funny,0
the rest of the crew were really likable in their roles and i think they got off to a good first season,0
nothing wrong with that,1
bride in the rain is a film that should only become a cult hit in britain'revisionist circles and in our own country as a warning in case you aren't an expert on such stuff,1
i also like greg 'typical american face' kinnear in the role of loser that is very lively made because there are plenty of people like danny wrightbr br so i recommend you to watch quite possibly the best role of brosnan ever,0
since its release in 1990 the movie 'the ring 2 the only one that remains alive is in a small english village as it was the first film filmed in this village,1
the idea that he would want to marry a man of such talent is so utterly bizarre,1
it 'll probably be some of the most boring things i ever watched but it will keep you guessing,1
pierce brosnan has sipped his last martini and returns in an outrageous selfparody as the aging foulmouthed boozy assassin julian noble who has a particular fondness for teenage girls bullfights and tacky clothes,0
br br during the flashbacks it 's obvious that he is n't all gruff,0
he is joined in this by his lifelong buddy played by walter brennan and no one else,0
helmer 's comeuppance,0
the movie takes place from about 1880 to 1900 and the plot has plenty of holes but it does make the movie enjoyablebrilliant,1

one of my favorite scenes is at the beginning when guests on a private yacht decide to take an impromptu swim in their underwear,0
so this odd couple of a team join forces and together enter a dangerous suspense filled ploy to gain paul 's safety and freedom,0
without question the best film of the 2000'seafest in the world has to its credit,1
really good looking and totally convincing it seems the role was really made for him,0
but it is in the same kind of movie it is a great movie for kids,1
he is also in the lead with eddie murphy,1
it've got nothing to do with your life and everything just happens and you realize that it is just not that bad at the very least not that bad,1
this version of the charles dickens novel features george c scott as the scrooge,0
the plot is not quite as good though in fact there have been a few episodes in which the plot has changed more and i do n n've missed anything,1
it showed an appearance of torch which can turn things and humans which is cool and showed the return of the puppet master from part one,0
that man needed such a weaponbr br however the main asset that the alamo thirteen days to glory has is a full blown portrayal of antonio de lopez de santa anna the president of mexico who comes up personally to put down the rebellion stirred up by the north americans who 've come to settle in texas at mexican invitation,0
occurs in the middle but it does nutifully add a lot more to this film,1
br br in summary the main characters spend their time fighting with themselves to not be eaten or raped by the monster,1
his voice sounds like an octave at times and the way it is delivered is just awful,1
an extraordinary vision of the future of the 7th art and the one of the most pioneering astounding rejoicing in the recent years,0
the ending is a little ambiguous but i take it literally it 's the easiest way out and the scariest,0
the first half is about four teenagers trying to figure out what to do in their small but troubled town,1
very enjoyable movie,0
that is what indian cinema is all about,0
it can be risky business as the viewer is required to let go of their moral values and laugh at the antics of a man who kills people,0
everything about this movie was horrible,1
sometimes it works but i found a lot of it rather heavy handed in this episode,0
what was the point in making this movie,1
almost none,0
actually it is never even asked,0
as peggy pepper rises in the movie star hierarchy she leaves comet for the more prestigious high art studio assuming the name patricia peppoire as more befitting her new station in life as a serious actress,0
but there is one thing that has gotten me hooked for years my mother would have loved this because as a childbrilliance and romance were the most obvious in james bond,1
the acting is excellent and the writing is just as good,1
one of the most memorable parts of the movie is when a group has to run from a group of crazed terrorists,1
just as the chess masters in the film do the director is playing many simultaneous games with our mind at once but all weave into either major or minor patterns,0
in the end i can only blame the actors who weren't that good,1
with every new scene the characters become much too silly for the time we've had so many of the typical clich 'twist endings on a daily basisbr br this may not have been the worst film i saw the other day but there were some good things about this film,1
everyone is pretty decent too,1
of course you are going to get the trolls who do n't understand what constitutes a good film and rip on low budget work because they have no idea what went into it,0
in this case the filmmakers did the right thing,1
interest is all about him so much that he has to be careful with his money because he can just as quickly turn around and walk across a field with all his money,1
so quit different role that she is n't in to,0
i enjoyed the music and the hidden pictures the only one i could ever get was the lemon hidden as part of a bridge over a garden streambr br really good memories are connected with camouflage,0
the way it ends was so sad and so unrealistic the whole moviebr br this kind of film is a real disappointment for all those interested from the beginning to at least the last 1530min,1
the movie was an obvious attempt at parody of the '60 saturday night live style,1
it is a really beautiful film,0
the plot is not terribly clever but it is so poorly written you have to laugh out loud to believe this is not what you saw in an x and that the movie is more like something from a b film than a k horror or even a g or somethingbr br it is a complete trawl of the screen where the actorsactresses are completely miscasting,1
leopold is strongly against taking any sides but is drawn in and seduced by katharina hartmann the femme fatale daughter of the owner of the railway company,0
it wasn't until later that she finally realized it really was her fault for leaving out all this important detail that was in the moviebr br her first line in her role was very good,1
i saw it one late night on tv and it hit the spot i actually think it was back in 1989 when it first appeared,0
the movie is very predictable and i felt like i was watching a comedy and in that sense it is pretty funny,1
the plot involves three friends with different goals and dreams and it has lots and tons of action packed action,1
good job dreamworks,0
think of all these actors who have appeared on stage in such bad movies with such poor production standards,1
we assume alexandre will even get a job and be the provider for his new found love and family,0
and the special effect is so lame you wo n're seeing much more than the real thing,1
chase seems to be on a downward spiral as he falls in his own little worldbrilliant and beautiful movie,1
look for cliff edwards the voice of jiminy cricket as bertbr br it 's always interesting to see the precode movies and dance fools dance is no exception,0
his a crew member of beat street a bboy crew,0
if you have n't see this movie you should,0
great cast very realistic story with great acting good direction acting by kim keller as usual,1
starring matthew pritchard who does pretty much anything lee dainton also up for just about anything dan joyce who hardly does much physical stuff and has a ott laugh and pancho who does a lot but is more popular for being short fat and lazy,0
the score courtesy of bruno nicolai is catchy and even though it does n't feature much of the psychedelic rock heard in the night evelyn came out of the grave it fits the film well,0
not easy to translate accurately though,0
we all get involved in the story which means that the only way we do not get the worst of it is that we watch the movie over and over againbrilliants,1
then some kind of evil and the world ends for bad br br i am pretty much dead wrong about this one,1
710,1
the acting in the movie is quite good and the dialogue is very original and funny,1
they did bring in the issue of slavery,0
other than the fact that it'screwed out like every film i ever seen this one is as good as anything out there,1
it 'es hard to think of a good episode of this and even that was made with a certain level on it so its not a masterpiece in my opinion,1
the movie shows more about why he becomes so bitter,0
the film the color purple manages to capture the essence of what is a complicated story,0
dominic monaghan really became the insomniac,0
maybe they wanted to let the characters develop without all the conflict,1
true i am not an expert but this is a movie about a man obsessed by his lovebr br i have seen this movie for the longest of the four weeks and i have been looking forward,1
heartbreak bride is an entertaining movie,1
it was a fun movie,1
save your money,1
he 'll never find out,1
it 's not about partying it 's not about sexuality but about these 4 girls and their final time as still young girls before they have to go the world alonebr br if you have ever had a friendship like that in your life you will feel this movieit will mean a lot to you no matter what era it is set in or what era you grew up in,0
it had a perfect balance of all five aspects,0
the cast was really fun to work with and you ca never want someone to appear at a film who just doesn't have the charisma and timing for it to workbr br i found the acting to make up with the music although one would have thought that was nastier oneliners,1
that 'll bring me back if i ever see one again,1
the problem is that yoda is too old and sick since he already has 900 years old and before he dies yoda says to luke that he does not need more trainingbut to really be a jedi he must fight with vader again,0
it was written by neil simon so its nonstop oneliners,0
what can you say for a film which deals with such controversial subjects as abortion and gay marriage,1
alice 'love you in my darkest day is a powerful meditation with a very moving message of love and humanity and an important message of redemption,1
granted it was entertaining but shallowbr br the bottom line this film helps to realize that life is not about how much money you have or what things you posses,0
there 's no soundtrack music to cue us,0
i know that some people like their films clean even those with violence in it,0
as david pursues the case he finds that he is far closer to the weird events taking place than he could ever realize,0
saura encompasses all spaniards on his stage from the beautiful elegance of elderly flamenco dancers in traditional costume to children joyously dancing with their instructors,0
the story lines have been interesting if rather heavily dependent on the wonders of dnatesting,0
but i can understand why someone might want to see this film since it're certainly worth seeing,1
when i saw the rating of u instead of an a i was happy that at least it is something where i do n't have to watch scantily clad women with bad acting skills doing nothing but dancing on every opportunity they get and making out with every guy to show that they have more skills in bed than a hollywood b actress,0
many have wondered why the movie was done so well,1
this is perfect break for him even so much as to make fun of the bond icon,0
this is certainly god 's country and filming it won an oscar,0
it've got to the best part of the movie the last thing that 'les jours des jeunes des la femme si la femmes a montagne et le jeune a film set just in the french country during the second part,1
the music is the best part of this movie,1
it 'll take it more then that and hopefully the end isn't exactly what it seems,1
the acting is superb it 'll be interesting to watch some more of the actors in the future,1
somehow they came up with this masterpiecebr br my favourite movie of all time,0
good silent drama,0
no you read that right,0
first of all while the comparisons to princess bride are inevitable it 's almost futile to do so,0
the characters are all interesting although there're hardly any nudity and this isn't something you would expect on a sex comedy,1
now she is having an adventure as she must face a monster who may have killed the family,1
brad pitt delivers one very effective performance at times but it is a weak performance that comes to the head of kareena sarkaria as miyasanta,1
it 'll take you far longer to figure it out because the rest of the movie leaves you asking yourself what are you doing wrong here,1
during the time frame of the movie and the nazi state and such significance to the train are dead but like decapitated chickens they persist in jolting through their reflexesbr br the characters music dialogue and plot are deliberately hammy and almost satirically procured from film noir conventions,0
at least the main character didn't die from cancer but he did so from an obvious gunshot in his arm,1
perhaps the acting is the best thing the film has to say but for all of its flaws it still is a well made filmbr,1
i also like the subplot that humans are bitter toward the vulcans,0
the constant role reversal creates the tone of the unknown,0
directing is superb here,1
he has great chemistry in it and i thought was going into it and it got better the more i thought it got better,1
br br stardust is more of a fairytale than an adventure film,0
maybe this is because gorris' takes nabokov 's initial ideas and gives them a different interpretation,0
seeing these people in action gives me a feeling of awe and wonderbr br my advice go rent it,1
also overlooked was the fact that it was not only aaron sheritt 's efforts alone that provided the victorian police with their insights into the unfolding mystery,0
the story starts off with the daughter of a wealthy wealthy business man marius and the young son of rich business man dumas,1
filmed in the town of shrewsbury england it just seems somehow very british,0
but they were not funny,1
no great coincidence the 1940s was awash with heavenandearth films but the glowing cotton wool nebulas and cutesy angels of the competition look tattered something best passed over in silence when placed next to alfred junge 's visionbr br it continues to look great all the way through as more and more striking ideas are sprung upon us,0
gary cooper is good as usual and i usually do n't like jean arthur but i liked her here,0
i grew up watching this series,0
study them,1
europa is what cinema should strive to be,0
the one true thing that is true about this film are those that believe in a man who is born in a world of chaos,1
however suitable for homer pathos and existentialist reflectionsbr br in italy was recently released a very good dvd version integral with excellent colors,0
and wow all the colors plus the enormously deep rightintotheheart going story makes you fall for this movie in an instant,0
by the waythis particular reviewer watches it every christmas on routine,0
therefore we know in our hearts that the evil brothers wo n't take the throne but the innocent boy who manages to overcome every obstacle and difficulty he encounters during his journey,0
a christmas carol is not a light story,0
all actors have a very different view on it this is a nice little flick that tells an honest tale of a family that is going under the impression of being in a depression and a war between the two sides of it,1
you've seen him in a couple roles before but his voice is much more than a caricature,1
also be prepared to see some more,0
after watching this i do believe that my rating is right up there with others,1
at the end of the movie and in that order,1
and you should see this moviebr br a must see if you are a fan of jenningsons films,1
there is a teasing onagain offagain sexual attraction between the two protagonists that culminates in a rather strange homage to north by northwest but it works because of the considerable sexual heat that builds slowly between the two stars,0
occasio was so bad it was hilarious,1
the only reason this film was even worth watching was because taylor played the part so much and i would have loved to see how she would react to the role,1
but what can i even call a true comedy as a film,1
one of them goes on a killing spree that seems to be all the more chilling considering the circumstances,1
the movie was directed by the amazing and brilliant chris russo who i hope i do too this timebr the cinemabrication is great some of the dialogues are very well done the special effect is great,1
how many of those movies in bollywood could nadja is a gem,1
weir shows how white society considers the native beliefs to be primitive superstitions and believes that since they are living in the cities and have been domesticated their tribal laws and culture no longer apply,0
if you have n 'got it in your 'll rent itbr br if it 'les to be seen please give me a break if this is your first time watching a film and would like to see more,1
in fact the cast in pedicab driver is one of the most interesting i 've seen in any other hk productionbr br the film has some interesting peaceful moments most notably about the love affair between max mok and fennie yuen and one crisis they confront thanks to lowell lo 's character,0
second the ending feels a little too rushed and as a result is a bit confusing,0
valentine is now one of my favorite slasher films,0
and we can see that this movie is not just one of the more beautiful films i 'll ever see,1
br br sometimes you have to lose to win,0
everyone is going to be killed off,1
this film is by far heartwrenching and very impactful and if i ever believed any film could alter a person 's life this would be the first that could have changed minebr br i adored this movie if you ever want a movie that 's moving and impactful while incredibly entertaining and real watch this,0
not only that but as fred later found out his wife rose had no idea what jimmy was really involved in with jimmy telling her that he works as a law abiding and inoffensive insurance adjusterbr br jimmy 's life of crime came full circle when rose after she found out about his secret life ratted him out to the police to prevent him from executing a valentine day like massacre with his gang members dressed as cops of his rival mobsters,0
some scenes are simply painful to watch,1
br br absolutely well worth your time just make sure to settle in to watch it without any interruptions,0
soundtrack by steven broderick and john mcneil,1
it 's all goodbr br i suspect more people than myself will watch this movie just to see some sub wreck scenes so i feel i must issue a warning,0
i think the critics have seen too many actions films and have succumbed to the matrix style of films,0
therefore it would be the safest policy to leave them out of the conversation all togetherbr br otherwise the retrospect on walter brennen was wonderfully done,0
while sexual tension in a show can often become a crutch i feel the tensions on enterprise can lead to much more and say alot more than is typical,0
oh yeah right,1
truth tell is very entertaining as the lead is just as good here as any other of his peers and has a lot to say about the world as an institution even if his previous roles are not particularly good,1
little details add much to the enjoyment,0
this film'resolves everything for me about americans but even that is too much,1
overall i give this a 710 for all the excellent acting and excellent dialogue,1
she has great chemistry in his films but she is so convincing as an actress that it is easy at first for meto understand why she was so popular with western viewers,1
in a word,1
the problem is that neither smith nor bean would have gotten quite as sleazy as gannon in turning every opportunity into a chance to make some money,0
if you haven't seen anything from him or his career i would not be so surprised if nothing else comes as an immediate surprise,1
the story is predictable and doesn't really move at all so you can see that all this is going to be explained quickly without even seeing that part of the film,1
the acting is very poor from the leads and kirk douglas was miscredited,1
if you haven't seen it but are curious about the movie i highly recommend it or the previous movie,1
academy award winner robert redford captures the majesty of the montana wilderness and the strength of the american family in this acclaimed adaptation of norman macleans classic memoirbr br craig sheffer stars as the young norman and brad pitt stars as his brother paul an irresistible daredevil driven to challenge the worldbr br growing up both boys rebel against their stern minister father br br while norman channels his rebellion into writing paul descends a slippery path to selfdestructionbr br also starring emily lloyd as wildhearted jessie burnsbr br the film won an academy award for best cinematopghaphy in 1993,0
and the colors explode from shot to shot used to express emotion rather than to represent realitybr br the characters have the same simplicity and directness of comic book characters offering no great depth in themselves but referring to archtypes that resonate more deeply,0
the film predictably concludes with the marriage and the groom on the wedding night tells his new bride who suffers from burn injuries come let me do your dressingbr br v i v a h showcases a lot of good things beauty of arranged marriage beauty of indian culture beauty of indian woman last but not least a nice idealism of the abouttobecouple waiting to get married playing by the rules,0
the last wave is simply not for everyone anymore than is magnolia,0
there are a few caveats a tooquickly wrapped up ending 24yearold corrine calvert is not very convincing as a naive french teenager and of course the film takes place in the mythic west a land of fable where the real laws of nations and physics do n't apply,0
will be seen several more tv films like this one,1
and the ending was nope they just took the best part of the movie,1
it seems to make much more of an argument in relation to the quality and authenticity with which the material was presented,1
slowly everyone grows up and goes away,0
this movie is just plain awful so the only thing that matters to an audience at this point in the film has been a bit topless,1
that said no one seems to be as fascinated about the characters as i do,1
these are my two most loved films on a danish film festival,1
is that what happens,1
br br i have nothing more to say but to suggest this film to anyone,0
if the story was made for the screen a few hours of time into a movie with a lot to say and this was the story to make it for the screen they might make it againbr br there are some elements of the movie that weren't original,1
ereal'sservations are nigh upon impossible and don't even go so far in explaining its philosophy at all,1
but i digressbr br the only one redeeming quality is robertson he was brilliant as the arrogant jerk and i think he was as strong as ever the one character he played wasn't the only onebrings back a fond nostalgia of a better time and a more optimistic timebr br but it''re still a great film and even if it gets lost in the hype the story can still bring in people interested,1
some scenes were a little unbelievable and or poor and i admit at a few minor parts it got just a small bit boring but overall it was nonstop entertaining and suspenseful,0
leaud is brilliant,0
although the story is based on myths and widely goes into supernatural it gives us a good idea of what life in the 10th century bc might have been likebr br the rhythm is somewhat slow and austere but the whole is so beautiful that you quickly get into it,0
of course they never get to the point of becoming heroes though,1
this movie is an insult not only to fans but also to the world of silent comedys,1
i have seen this miniseries in 8 parts on french television as far back as 1974 i was a kid back then and although it was all in black and white it left a very vivid impression,0
there is this kinderkinder kinder kinder spirit,1
if anyone actually knows how to spot these bad movies or if they are really worth the effort watch the danish version on hbo,1
its theme is essentially no more than the interactions that take place as their holiday progresses not only between these four very disparate mature ladies but also with the occasional male visitor,0
how do these people get to be rich,1
ever wondered how the real police work is likebr br well for germany this film shows you,0
it has this magical 'aura' from the beginning to the very end of the movie,0
i wish i could find more movies like that one,0
the actors and actresses played the parts wonderfully and the way it ended was so brilliant and cunning,0
pfeiffer played a decent villain i liked her as the snippy mother in hairspray,0
robert deniro is hysterical,0
the movie starts out well enough with the jokes being visual enough that they translate the language barrier and make the nonfight dialogue sequences passable,0
besides this time our heroes look like different people princess leia no longer fights with solo luke looks boring darth vader is not as evil as before and yoda just diesbr br but there are many extraordinary things going on this episode that i just ca n't hate itbr br some spoilers 1 jabba the hut 2 the sail barge attack sequence,0
i am thinking here particularly of his flamenco version of carmen a spectacular work of art that is available in europe but not here,0
after i had seen a good movie like this for so little money there really was no way i would want it for my next visit,1
i do n't totally agree with that although this moment is probably played out a bit longer than it should,0
i recommend this movie to anyone interested in a good drama,0
it'screamed in his head,1
for the most of the movie i wouldn't recommend this movie unless your a fan of the originalbrittagh,1
this show was one to avoid,1
yes the problem of the most german films are in this film gespenster too,0
there is also a brief but very funny scene where a group of actors and actresses are on a set and they have a chat,1
she 'll do anything and everything to save him and the citybrained guy she finds herself in the middle of a series of bad decisionsbr br in short a very poor film which was made in the 1970''ssixties,1
you also catch glimpses of eleanor boardman elinor glyn claire windsor king vidor and many others who are otherwise just names and old photographsbr br please even if you 're not a fan of the silents take the time to catch this film when you can,0
the character development is absolutely top notch and i am surprised that this film was nastier then anything you have heard about the last two movies,1
miraglia may be no argento when it comes to spilling blood but he certainly knows how to drop an over the top murder into his film and here we have delights involving a volkswagen beetle and a death on an iron fence that is one of my all time favourite giallo death scenes,0
with the exception of its title it're not a comedy,1
the movie really took off at this point but just before it finished one scene went on and it was as if a couple hours passed,1
even at first i thought the movie was going to fail since there was no attempt by director rochester to add much plot which at first seemed to just show us a bunch people,1
well worth the search,0
and to think that this movie is based in the first place because it has been made several thousand times before,1
lena is the true pioneer of the modern riotgrrrl movement confusion curiosity and wit are her main attributes she is occasionally angry but are n't we all,0
more often you have to see her to see her in a film and to see an actor with such a depth of acting acting and charm playing a character like this will really put your interest up,1
but the rest is nigh,1
simple yet beautiful such a simple story no plot no villain as is the case with most of sooraj barjatya films,0
since this film is based on real events this obviously made it to the screen it is a great movie,1
quality not qauntity,0
the photography is also quite good,0
yes it've got a cute story toobrigate italian clich 'the man'has died and is a widow a husband and a father but this is a very bad sequel,1

bradford 'the man with dreams was really a comedy but with a strong story and excellent performances by all involved it is a masterpiece,1
i was all mixed up,0
the other characters were annoying and the direction did not add enough to this movie like in another movie where an older man has been killed and they try to revive him but the scene where they kill her is very interesting,1

mr goring who had worked with the directors is one of the best things in the movie,0
they learn together the importance of their relationship and of this invaluable period of their lives and work to strengthen the bonds of marriage,0
perhaps the movie could have become a cult gem if the director had only followed the book the way it was written,1
at best he had a cameo and a very good performancebrad pitt did her part in the same film but i would nega not recommend it,1
watching this film is great because of the fantastic direction and story,1

in contrast with the recent hbo series the baltic of the bay the main focus seems to focus more in britannica of today and the britains,1

the film follows peter dorak who is studying a book for a graduate degree and lives on a yacht that is owned and servile by an attractive lady and a very very very nice man who comes to nam and asks for her help in his plan of getting the boat to go on vacation,1
but what really irritate is that it seems like the director did not have the ability or inclination to make this kind of film,1
unfortunately for those who have seen it you 'll realise there have n're yet more holes than i can fill,1
at first glance this little gem could turn up in just an empty warehouse of film stores and rental houses,1

blues,1
i did have a little trouble with the alfred molina character having such an epiphany so quickly but within this world it needed to happen,0
the acting is top notch,1
its shot in black and white with shots of color randomly appearing throughout,0
the real gem to be found here though is the performance of young anthony walters as tiny tim it 's heartfelt without ever becoming maudlin and simply one of the best interpretations and the most real ever presented on filmbr br the excellent supporting cast includes roger rees caroline langrishe lucy gutteridge michael gough and joanne whalley,0
brilliant stuff as i 'll say,1
an illiterate nice guy loser who turns out to actually be with a little help from jane 's character a 1990 version of henry ford or thomas edisonbr br this genre has been more successfully handled by nobody 's fool in the mid 90s and this year 's about schmidt,0

the standout showing comes from the unheralded oprah winfrey as miss sophia the single minded fighting black woman whose spirit is crushed by a terrible incident involving a patronising upper class white woman,0
but that'sure could've been a decent cast,1
sammo hung 's 1989 film pedicab driver is considered by many to be his masterpiece,0
this made for television version of the legendary stand against hopeless odds is more objective more realistic than earlier filmed versions of the events though the one movie made after this went perhaps too far in humanizing the figures of sam houston bowie travis and crockettbr br the focus here is on jim bowie played with sharp cynical detachment by james arness who is apparently still alive at age 85 then 65 he made a comeback to acting after years away from the screen to do this partbr br puerto ricanborn raul julia humanizes gen santa ana as no one since j carol naish back in '54 had done,0

br br also given the climate of homophobia say circa us in the 1980s the two young women who fall in love with one another are forced to keep their love a very private matter hence the focus on their interaction in the apartmentbr br it 's remarkable and commendable in my view that this queer themed film was even made in romania and i find the complaint of the previous reviewer about the poor film quality quite uninformed and patronizing,0

good acting,1
the characters are simply boring and the storyline in general has no substance whatsoeverbr br if this were a low rent movie i would have given it another chance,1

and then again in the same breath the film could also be called the story which revolves about the human nature of evil which is as much of an enigma that can be addressed in the filmbrandon diaz would be a good choice here as her role is quite minor and she certainly shows her range,1

there was so great promise in the book by the end of the movie that it is hard for it not at last come true in the ending and the final scene,1

and i'm not knocking 'out of africa' either but it was in my mind a class behind this one an epic story of suffering and hope that brought me to tears and i'm not a big cryerbr br maybe it was the music or the cinematography but more likely simply the acting whoopi who proved to all of us that she was much more than just a comedienne danny glover who i 'd never heard of before and of course oprahbr br the rest is history but at the time who knew,0
william powart steals the movie and a huge part of the action is in his performance,1

and there are even moments of great beauty from jason,1
in fact the entire movie is made with just enough action and comedy to make it nearly painful to sit through until after thatbrilliants,1
they 'll just have to look elsewhere to see who has the brains to put together that work for thembrbr,1
and this is a film by the talented mary keaton,1
it was almost like watching a bunch of highschool students play a game about how long we should stick to school and how much we would like to spend,1
but as the movie went on the movie went from funny harmless to downright terrifyingbr br there was some serious acting work from edmond battell as a man with superhuman powers,1
the trailer for dreams of an angel shows that and i ca n't wait to see the higher budget stuff she 's done,0
of all the kuroshiki films this one gets the top spot,1
maybe you 'll like it but it 'll probably only be a 7 or 4 but please,1
there are much more comedy in this good one thoughbr br we 're back at the danish rigshospitalet the danish national hospital,0
the music is great it've got a number to it,1
then there is this great film the film about a guy who has been killed by an american in his hometown,1
it had a mindtwisting story line which made you guess the whole way through and it does n't deserve all the crap it gets,0
same goes for the endearing relationship between alfred and bernie,0
for me too this christmas special is one that i remember very fondly,0
with the constant need for her to be happy in their relationship and even more of the same when it is time for the boys,1
i ca n't stop myself from watching it every time it comes on satelite,0
the landscape is gorgeous,0
at the risk of being too serious the concept of being a big fan of a certain band is timeless and high school students boredom with drudgery of some classes is just as timelessbr br and the film has some gem linesscenes references to how our permanent record in high school will follow us through life,0
i 'll try to explain it best i can because to my knowledge no other films have done it though it is a great techniquebr br think of yellow as a living thing actual events in 14 scenes,0
this is the kind of movie england can do in its sleep and that 's meaning it as a compliment,0
you won't go out and find out how bad it is because it is nope its a bad bad movie bad,1
brag the entire film is filmed in gothic and medieval style but without much in the waybr br it're a shame when the film is not shown in gothics with subtitles like it was in the film itselfbr br the plot of the film is very interesting but it goes nowhere with the dialogue in the film and as a whole it 'll stay with you for many hoursbr br if your a fan of greek movies you've probably heard a lot about it here on the net but if you're looking to get more into the greek culture and the history you're probably better off sticking your nose,1
the cast was great,1
and it ends very upbeat,0
spielberg bashers take note the guy can make an unforgettable classic without any cute aliensbr br rating 10 of 10,0
we're in it and are trying not believe anythingbr br i give it a 75 out of 10 the premise and the plot were intriguing and fun to see,1
that '90 '96 version is far superior and should be seen for what it is,1
i 've seen both the 1983 version and the 2001 and the 2001 is far better in comparison imobr br besides the subtitles i have one additional complaint about this movie i did n't want it to end i'm begging you mr hark can we please have a sequel,0
probably the first and last time on the screenbr br i recommend this film and now own the dvd,0
the heightened drama intensity and undertone of violence threatens on the the melodramatic or farcical yet never steps into it,0
very good,0
i knew about this as a similar programme as jackass and i saw one or two episodes on freeview and it is the same only more extreme,0
alok nath anupam kher seema biswas are terrific supports and the rest of the cast does a reasonable job,0
br br if this sounds like a movie you haven't seen it do something else,1
but you know the movie,1
she even has important things to say about honesty and the lack of it in her protocol surroundings,0
there is much to like about the film i think especially the way the main character is portrayed throughout and his friendship towards the main character and the fact this main characters friendship is not only important on the screen it 'also in the end the ending is very much anticapitalistic,1
vader the man who hid behind a mask for 20 years is finally revealed as a sicklooking man,0
it 's waltz no,0
while the film is well done i could nay predict that a few of its elements should go in an equally bad direction,1
i had seen dirty sanchez before i saw jackass and think it way surpasses jackass in terms of programme making,0
i put a lot of that down to the departure of producer gary kurtz,0
two people die and i have heard people say that 'they died because they had sex with someone that was about as disgusting and disgusting as they came in a trash bin and then put it in the trash and put on a toilet and put on a wall and then walk away the guy died the whole time he was lying there on the toilet,1
one thing i liked about it is the way mary kennedy and geraldine schwarzenberry do a good jobs as the women,1
your average horror movie about someone having to go through some horrible part of their daily lives with no idea as to who they are or why they did it,1
may i repeat please do not rent this moviebrilliant movie,1
john gosling and his wife dianastyle laurie were very good here and gorsling has a nice role but he doesn't come anywhere near the kind of performance that hugh grant made in the wonderful and underrated the boy with two hearts and forrest gump did in i do you,1
the lead couple isbr br clumsy inept funny and endearing in their first copulation scenebr br the secondwhich caused the most complaintshas fakedbr br cunnilingus and fellatio,0
in the film the two girls seem less interested at eachother than in the love story they are writing,1
or when our heros were rescuing princess leia and being shot at as han solo and luke were trying to exit the death starbr br the last reason that i care to discuss is that people did not like darth vader being revealed,0
norman goes to dartmouth to study,0
the scene that makes her go at it is pretty much a scene in the woods at the end of a movie,1
i seriously love this film so much i never get sick of watching it,0
no,1
i loved this movie,0
the music is amazing and adds a certain edge to this movie,1
the background music seemed very appropriate for an romantic italian locale,0
i recorded a subsequent airing of the film a year or two later and kept watching the ramones concert sequences over and over again thinking man these guys kick ass,0
but i don't think they were to blame for trying to get him over the head with this movie,1
he is an accomplished director who uses a wide variety of techniques and styles of film making with all the elements shown,1
great acting allaround and a very good mix with a wonderful storylinebr br my only complaint is that although it is a very well done film it would not be as good if this had a bit of substance,1
in my opinion the main character has an odd little personality,1
there was a scene in the movie which is quite funny,1
i wo n't give away what happens but i will tell you that the film can sometimes be frightening in it 's realismbr br the directing is fantastic focusing on what is essential to the story without allowing it to lose any entertainment or thoughtprovoking momentsbr br all in all i give this great film 9 out of 10 for going far beyond what i thought any short could achieve,0
amusingly for a film so big and full of contradictions it 'll make any of us realize how hard it was for a director to keep them from being too much of something and also how well he was at keeping his character 'the only one who could hold the movie together for his own good and be a part of it and that is the way it is with this film,1
and in extreme cases the object of that satisfaction may become a manifested obsession driving that individual on until what began as a means of survival becomes the very impetus of his undoing and as we discover in the luzhin defence' directed by marleen gorris a high level of intelligence will not insure a satisfactory resolution to the problem and in fact may actually exacerbate the situation,0
never one of my favorite movies and i'm not sure this was a movie that i missed from the box set as i didn't particularly like any one of the cast,1
the fact remains that the film is a very good drama and definitely worth renting,1
after debating whether i should waste almost 3 hours on a meaningless movie i decided to watch it realizing i had nothing else to do,0
if anything this film is just a very nice touch though,1
also she was on a different team and in a way she was better as a femalebr br she just looked a wee bit better after this and was more believable,1
neither is the first time i've seen something i felt like crying,1
it stumbles a few times into trek convention and clichcandycolored space strippers never seem to go out of style and i can already foresee snickering references to t'pol as seven of vulcanbut the ensemble looks strong the characters are welldrawn and one can already see hints that this particular crew will have to be more resourceful in different ways than those of earlier series,0
if you ever get the chance it 's a lot of fungreat music heartwarming and cheesy,0
good camera work alsobr br the names of the actresses and actors are not at the top of the american star list,0
the film was directed and written by john cusick and i believe his most notable contributions are the scene in which he makes his way to a group of children at a home of a man who lives there,1
his anarchy is playful but not completely loaded with semantics or tricks that could put off the less initiated viewerbr br if i am curious stands up as an intellectual enterprise and a fullblown trip into exploring sex in a manner that was and is captivating for how much is shown and how comfortable it all seems to be for the actors it is n't entirely successful i think as an emotional experience,0
good movie and worth watchingbr br 4 out of 5 bad movie,1
there're many things this film has in common with the first four films and in fact as far i'm concerned a third or four is much more interesting and more interesting,1
so the film was definitely not worth much money to me,1
one reason the movie works is the background normalcy of chamberlain 's wife and little daughters,0
and to add a touch to the tragedy and irony of what is happening is that the movie has the misfortune of being so horribly filmed,1
ever heard of julian wongbr br and then you do n 'll find yourself saying yes,1
it seems her films are a flop and no theatres want to book them the public are tired of her mannerisms and want the old peggy back,0
and why were n't most of ronda 's pack horses and mules also buried by the avalanchebr br you will see a host of probably nameless but familiar faces among the miners and gannon 's gang,0
ford for his part looks bored and lacks the style that distinguished his earlier performances,0
thanks for watching this movie its that good,1
to describe it as the story of two girls who meet and eventually become friends and lovers or as the story of an orphaned mother who searches europe for her lost daughter clearly does n't say much about the nature of gespenster at all,0
first of all i did not think there was any chemistry with the writer and it did not even have any chemistry between the actor or the writer,1
the idea with these young boys is that they might make the same kindof film as the original and we would 'll be able to relate to them as humans in the next years,1
obviously i was totally under impression of pierce brosan 's magnificent role,0
vital severe masterpiece,0
auriel'vete de sable the wife who runs a drug store and the father who owns the place all in all is not to be overlooked,1
she would have been a major hit with her musicbrilliance brbr br i do agree the movie had a good story and good musicbr br i was not overly impressed with the way the characters treated each of them,1
i can almost still hear that statue laughing madly,0
initially he claimed great liberal ideals but he once admitted that the people of mexico were children who needed guidance for one hundred years before they could rule themselves,0
this is not a good movie at least not for the purpose,1
as with 2001 space odyssey i think europa will receive it 's rightfully deserved place in cinemahistory,0
i wanted to see the real person fight but oh well a few small let downsand i did n't really like it a lot until i watched it again when you understand it more it totally kicks a,0
the best film of 2008,1
br br not a bad effort,0
perhaps that why the crew of the uss enterprise like it so much,0
no the focus is what brosnan and kinnear get out of their unlikely relationship to each other,0
she has more in depth than i could havebr br i do like the sound track but i hate it so as it was so disappointing,1
recently i was pondering a statement made by the artist thomas kinkade in one of his inspirational books he states you and i were not designed to breathe the fetid air of five o'clock traffic,0
the largest xica enemy violante bride that it was changed by xica is a woman of big it influences the portugal king close to and does to take revenge of the slave of everything,0
it 's kind of an apocalyptic tale,0
even without the scriptwriters and the production values i would still call this a classic,1
it is a very simple thing this movie is about a woman who is in the process and trying for fame but her life is not so happy,1
these are the best times of my time for that period,1
it works best when all the elements are on an equal footing where only the blending of those elements in the order or combination in which they are presented will communicate the idea,0
the film has some great music and the scenes in the prison are well choreographed and executed,1
angela molina puts an appearance as carmen the wife of the caretaker of the institution,0
flawlessly unspun dialogue is the only redeeming feature of his filmbr br i gave this one a 2 out 100 as a waste of time,1
this might be a good time to pick up your camera and start watching this masterpiece of acting and writing,1
and again to cover that one up,0
moveis where money is not the most important thing,0
the rest of the time i just wanted nothing more to watch,1
questionablebr br this film has no redeemions and is not at all worth seeing or even trying to,1
the plot isn't bad the costumes are well made and the actors are pretty decent,1
it was interesting how the whole thing is a crosscutting series but even when all the different characters get combined into a single story at the end it just cauterizes the fun,1
that 's the attraction to the irony of basing a horror film on valentine 's day,0
when he meets his old love in a bar he discovers his true heritage and the true love and his true destiny,1
it was actually better than most sequels for tv movies,0
although george c scott is the only actor in this version of acc without a british accent he more than makes up for it with his overthetop and largerthanlife interpretation of ebenezer scroogebr br particularly effective is when he confronts bob cratchit in his office at the movie 's end,0
that being said what one carries away from this movie is n't so much the similarities to classic hitchcock thrillers although those elements are definitely there but the pervasive view a of a modern day city where life runs the gamut from mundane workdays to a boozy garish nightlife where sex drugs and laundered money infiltrate the lives of several characters,0
although this may be a cheap and underplayed film i still feel that it is a good film and has it as a background for its characters to grow up,1
there is another character in the film a young girl who loves him but hates him much more than she loves herselfbrainedbrains are there,1
actually this film has no redeemment in the way of atmosphere or cinemaboy and the script is dull the acting of the leads really just sucks,1
this film has a great cast of actors and i was really surprised by this film 'film of the year,1
add to this the very good acting and the amazing special effects which make this movie the most memorable,1
what i enjoyed about this movie is that it did n't go for cheap comedy when it could have,0
he has a knack for playing these types of roles he is the guy who is going home and doing drugs and has the right kind heart he wants to get out of his job to get out to his family he wants a chance to change this and be accepted,1
or maybe it is already hell that describes the end like in sarte 's huitclot and absolutely not like in the final liberation of le temps retrouv,0
it starts slowly showing the dreary lives of the two housewives who decide to rent a castle in italy for the month of april but do n't give up on it,0
it was just plain good,1
it'stacks of clich that goes way too long for the script to work on it could have made a great book if it were more accessible and more coherent,1
my personal favourite characters in all three movies were the two who are the hero the evil girl and her mother a little bit of a surprise as to who her mother was when she was a child,1
the earlier murders are frustratingly devoid of gore,0
this film is quite simply a poor piece where as many of the original actors did a great job,1
well the first half and part were decent to some extent but it seemed like things were a bit rushed,1
she also underplays the menace produced by the presence of valentinov concentrating on the drama rather than the suspense which ultimately serves to heighten the overall impact of the film making luzhin 's tragedy all the more believable and unsettlingbr br the single element that makes this film so memorable however is the affecting performance of john turturro,0
as a former marine who served with the marine infantry and received excellent service in the war of nazis during this time the film portrays our military as a whole,1
i 've never been a fan of pj soles and it did n't help to hear that she did n't even know who the ramones were until she filmed this movie but i can ignore her snarly little face for the most part,0
the characters in fact seem very shallow they seem like the stereotypes of the '70'seventeen and the same old characters are in a lot worse movies,1
this is one hellacious ripoff of 'the matrix'it'sthe first part is pretty entertaining and is goodbr br the story're not even worth saying about this one it 'll make you cry at the tv screen and maybe take you to the cleaners,1
teleporting into another world they go to the same house the same thing,1
although the director tried to create a suspenseful atmosphere this film seemed to be trying a more simplistic approach,1
he may not be morricone but in these lighter pieces he might as well be so,0
willie mccartney is a talented dancer and is a terrific supporting cast with diane lane and gary cooper as the lead singers bride and dylan,1
more than anything it just leaves you laughing hysterically,1
davis in one of her best roles since american splendor gives another charming and witty performance,0
this movie is definitely not for everyone,1
there 'll be others like that too in this movie,1
carla becomes attracted to paul and to the fact that he makes her feel attractive forwhat seems likethe first time,0
yet i must admit i cried like a lost little baby during this movie,0
it is not an easy film to watch it is over three and a half hours long and it is composed entirely of conversations,0
but when lon chandler shows a little boy his memory and tells them that he is the boy with the memories of a father and child his daughter and he is able of moving back to the worldbr the film also gives the viewer another view on how we humans see and experience death,1
he simply is a superb human being and his charm wit and compassion are overwhelming to watch,0
when he finally gets her home he finds her still having nightmares and is trying on everything including some clothes,1
the way we see the world through the eyes and memories is also very moving and touchingbrittany pagostini and gregor bloch create a very moving and funny moviebr br you can find this movie very hard to find but if you watch it you 'll find it a very special movie in the same spiritbrillat,1
the story is well written and well paced but in the hands that are nned aplenty the characters have holes and inconsistencies i'm going to go on a bit of babbling here but that 'll suffice,1
they 'll tell him the good and the bad and tell him the good that the movie will win,1
not only his role in the story but his performances are all solid and convincing,1
the other characters could have given a few more memorable performances but not enough,1
this movie is a real letdown of that genre,1
the story begins with a young man named christian who has a very close friendship with an old english gentleman named christian who is a great man,1
yes this movie looks like an xmen adventure but nothing like the classic one and as for the original story the reason why this movie made it're never explained has to do with michael cera's directorial decision,1
slightly lesser sequel but definitely still one to watch if you liked the first,0
overall well worth catching i gave this one 101 minutes on a scale of a 1 it was quite a funny film,1
thus he is unable to play the purported mating move rd1d8 which would be illegal but he 's shown doing so to rapturous applause from the audience,0
in most versions of this tale the scene with marley tends to be a bit of a low point in the film simply because it 's difficult to portray a dead man convincingly and the results are usually just plain silly in this version it is perhaps the most riveting scene in the whole movie,0
the film is not very well photographed,1
my favorite part was when she was the main singer of jazzy stuff that sounded as if it were a high school musical,1
this movie is wonderfulbr br i was 'enchanted' i should say and surprised because of how uniquely it was done,0
alexandr sascha luzhin is a former leading chess player attempting a comeback at an italyhosted tournament,0
the storyline is basicbut hey whats there to tell a story about,0
but this time he finally does it right,0
it does seem that when this movie premiered it was already sold off by the time the movie was released,1
these things could happen to anyone,0
repeat,0
your wife just loves the movie and her father was in it,1
even before the film properly begins he kills two of his hired cowboys who were helping on a cattle drive to seattle because of some dispute,0
the best thing about this movie so far seems really that the actors did a good enough job but the editing was just a bit off and the movie was a tad flat,1
this is a great film esp when compared with the sometimes wearisome earnestness of today 's politicallyminded filmmakers,0
they are not just a handful of young teenagers or an urban legend in the world of film,1
he is a bit slow and he does not make some scenes look good,1
like an aussie response malick,0
as it was the original star trek movie didn't have a star trek name and was a tv movie,1
in this case i felt nothing,1
home room came as a total surprise,0
much of it was poorly scripted,1
who knew such things in a generally peaceful country could be so heatedup politically,0
watch the film today and you can see why show people is a delightful hollywood satire that retains its charm because it lampoons its targets with wit and flair yet without malice,0
at least in empire strikes back the battle of endor was much more believable since you had two armies pitted each other not 3 heroes against a legion of stormtroopers,0
because saura has truly made magic and perhaps best so when he dropped any sort of conventional storybr br iberia is in a similar style to some of saura 's purest musical films no narration no dialogue only brief titles to indicate the type of song or the region beginning with a pianist playing albeniz 's music and gradually moving to a series of dance sequences and a little singing,0
and rather than the mandatory happy ending this story has a bitter sweet one,0
billy chow and sammo hung are amazing,0
next to him stands a man in a black suit looking a little scary,0
everything about the film is bad,1
she is not only gorgeous but hilarious in this film,0
but when the film finally ended it was an exciting moment for me with james coates doing a good portrayal that seemed natural,1
also i do not see any reason to believe the man who played the villain in this movie could have been anything but the stereotypical villain with a dark side,1
no names and seasoned actors alike the cast was amazing,0
i think it is a nice movie i think it is a very romanian movie through scenery and atmoshpere i think it was not intended to be sensual i think it is very natural i think it is humane i think it was interesting i think the actors never made me think waw lame acting neither is the film a block buster they are like the movie normal ppl that can act i think the movie reached its intention i think it made me feel things i think i'm not objectivebr br i really enjoyed it that i know,0
but this was nbc '79 when he made this film but it was still a classic to this point and now that its done a lot more i think this is worth seeingbr br 101,1
i have seen this movie a half dozen times or more and never tire of seeing parts of it again,0
for a moment i almost believed the gang would win the battle at glenrowan alas it was not to bebr br some aspects of the film are fictional and as an avid ned kelly fan was slightly disappointed by this,0
10,1
in most of tsui harks 's movies he combines dramafantasymartial arts and humor,0
you have to keep on thinking it're all a bit of an exaggeration when it comes from rick berry or jon voider,1
okay first of all i got this movie as a christmas present so it was free,0
her mother 'emma dies early in the film and has to take care for her niece and the poor boy,1
clint eastwood also has a cameo and plays a pretty good boy who is nastier than you would imagine,1
michael pollard looks suitably seedy for his role which pretty much sums up the unfulfilled early promise of his career and everyone else plays it pretty straight ahead,0
i guess it being one of the first movies about the movies you could call it a behind the camera story,0
it're the kind which would make a fine television show,1
thriller with sex and murder but it keeps you guessing right to the end,0
they are all very good,0
robert de niro seemed to be having too much fun for the most part,0
this movie reminds me a little bit of dynamics established between the main characters in my blue heaven but more genuine in their coping mechanisms,0
who're the culprit for the baddies,1
i came across an insomniac 's nightmare while looking for offbeat independent films and glad to say it did not disappoint,0
ironically soon after jeff changes from antihero to hero rhonda makes a similar change in running into the street to warn jeff of gannon 's impending ambush,0
the film is not a bad attempt but it falls somewhere in the between and the two films are very uneven,1
i strongly recommend seeing it in the theatre i know i 'll be going back for seconds,0
poor edgar durbin seems to have lost his job and his reputation in the movie industrybrigitta'salma rukherji the wife of fay bachchan her husband'shahidhaan chadhi has always claimed that she has nothing but contempt for the husband and daughter even after taking the family hostage,1
if you were alive in the 1970s like me you might even feel like you were in that apartmentbr br willy clearly has been living there too long,0
nor is it entirely clear but he still did a great role if he was cast with any respect,1
the red queen kills seven times is definitely one of them,0
batista is one such bad move,1
even though it has one of the standard revenge price plots this film is my favorite of vincent price 's work,0
the movie may not have served its diplomatic purpose as was hoped for but its originality continues to inspire moviemakers and viewers alike on both sides of the atlantic,0
oprah keaton'shahruff is also very good as bachchan,1
br br the theme song is a favourite and we were disappointed to find it is n't available in any published edition,0
perhaps this is what makes us watch movies,1
this film challenges the notions of morality and naturalness eg,0
all character have very cool power and the special effect are near perfection in one word flawless,0
thankfully not only did i see it but it seemed to me as if i was watching an episode for at most an eightyear oldbrilliar,1
specifically this film is of interest because there is a sense that the filmmakers do manage to be a little bit ahead of their day when they take on the world of the black and white movie,1
neither have the ability given their two personalities the chemistry and the chemistry of a pair of brothers at the age they are,1
the humanity in scrooge was driven out long ago he 's a hard case a whole lot like his 20th century counterpart mr potter of bedford falls new yorkbr br but as charles dickens told this tale redemption is not too late for any of us and a lonely ghost and three spirits visit scrooge and show him howbr br a christmas carol is such a timeless holiday classic that we sometimes forget that it is as much a social commentary of 19th century great britain as oliver twist was,0
the combination of reading the novella and viewing this film has inspired my wife and i to new levels,0
may ormaynot have been the first,1
however having just seen 'finding john christmas' and its predecessor 'a town without christmas' for the first time within a week of each other i have to say that 'max' peter 's falk 's delightful character in both movies is surely as memorable and lovable as 'columbo',0
good idea from start till end,1
after about 30 seconds he realizes he've killed her so he takes her into a nearby warehouse where he takes out a large assortment,1
i loved the main actress and the absolute rejection of any prevalent clich about the police,0
if you like that you will like this,0
the movie is about a man who is obsessed with killing someone and has a great deal in common with all the other killers a killer who is not really that good and a killer that is very well played by james caget,1
you almost wish people like this really existed,0

i saw this film at amsterdam 's international documentary film festival and was privileged to meet both the directors and tobias schneebaum all of whom are lively and outspoken new yorkers,0
this intelligent and exciting movie supports that argument,0
i truthfully find it quite refreshing sort of like putting your troubles behind you and enjoying a summer picnic with friends,0

this time udo kier plays two parts as the monster baby and his demonlike father,0
the main character is a child whose parents are separated yet he manages to escape from this life and is now married with their sonbrite and alexis also a goodlooking girl but this movie is nothing compared with this type of movie,1
the acting directing and script is all perfect,0
the characters were vivid and wellacted,0
they're just trying a hard story telling in a very oldfashioned way,1
they've also gotten into a romance plot and they have an extremely silly sex sequence,1
after all the film makes it clear that she was desperately in need of a partner and loving childrenbr br well cast but not my idea of an evening 's entertainment,0
the acting is atrocious,1
i'm not a follower of a certain movie genre,0
the character development was so good i wanted to laugh and cry and i was surprised to find the scene between her brother and mrs richter where the two people meet and are in a bar when the bar closes down to all but 2 women for the 2 men ',1
freud might express such things in symbols,0
the main guy does nutifully watch the movie and tries the worst thing i can do to get a good chuckle at the whole situation,1

the characters in the film make a difference and the stories they tell is amazing to watch,1
the movie isn't quite so bad but the movie itself,1
irene papas gives us a typical greek tragedy style performance as penelope but most amazing is the albanian actor bekim fehmiu as ulysses,0
there is a mutual physical repulsion at first meeting carla had hoped for a wellgroomed genteel man who might fulfill her fantasies and paul is a coarse unkempt sleazy guy who is not impressed with being a clerk,0
to me the whole film was like an experience even if i did see it on a small television screen,0
camera work which is supposed be used by actors,1
especially sartre who is shown quickly in the french intellectual caf aux deux magots where alexandre too is sitting all day must serve as excuse for the lifestyle of alexandre and his colleagues because they suffer existential crisis from bourgeois nausea,0
you want to be a big bad movie fan,1
just when you think you 've seen a lot,0
the two main characters are very different and are very different personalities to each other and their lives in a very realistic fashion with very real problems,1
i appreciate the use of mirrors in revealing the activity going on behind the cameras,0
brilliant movie,0
there's nothing wrong here but it doesn't seem to work out,1
this film does not go deeply enough into the relationship between luzhin and natalia,0
his wife leaves and his teenage daughter returns and he falls into a comabr br i think that the problem is that this movie did nsthe only one scene that made any differencewas when he realizes his wife is about to get a new man with whom he can have a meaningful sexual relationship with him,1
to get them there they have to find the right way through the maze as to how the hell to defeat mummies and save their livesbr br and of all of that i love and respect the whole series by jim and kevin,1
the creepiest being the opening scene in the morgue,0
her relationship with her friends is both a thorn and a balm in her life,0
definitely worth a rentalbr br so in summary i 'd recommend checking it out for a little friday night entertainment with the boys or even your girl br br the villains are good too,0
the famous static line the school board member who is so decrepit he 's attended by nurses the nazi hall monitors love for a body search principal togar announcing i give you the final solution and burning the ramones records and of course joey ramone noting things sure have changed since we got kicked out of high school followed by togar asking do your parents know you 're ramones,0
br br i've seen the dvd and it did not disappoint,1
the scene where he shows his hands and toes and then a second camera is close to the body was shot on location in a small park in the mountains,1
weird,0
the idealist inevitably has to reject society in order to stay idealistic and becomes the terrorist,0
the supporting cast was pretty good too,0
an event has occurred at her school a shooting,0
the acting is topnotch denise richards marley shelton and david boreanaz are a lot of fun,0
on the surface it tells the story of a man who falls in love with a pig but like any great fable it 's not really about animals it 's about something bigger stifling conformity in americabr br the stage version won international acclaim in its original production it toured the us and europe and with others of its kind influenced almost all theatre that came after it,0
but i still think that there were still some good laughs which were not really present,1
this is a scandal,0
henry kennaston the most interesting actor i 'll ever seen to appear on stage and his portrayal of a man who is on the brink of madness as opposed all the way down to a bgrade hollywood'setpiecebrilliarism,1
overall a very good movie,1
br br if this film had been directed by larry clark then this story about a school shooting probably would have been shown through the eyes of the killer and whatever led that person to go insane in the first placebr br instead the plot focuses mainly on the aftermath of a school shooting and how it effected the victims who survivedbr br i had seen busy phillips in other films before but her performance in this movie is by far her best,0
he does it with the familiar bond smirk and manages to get away with it,0
let 's not try to make it anything else but what it is light fare,0
tonally as the narrator states and is also shown repeatedly in the dialogue the story is told through flashbacks,1
oun of course is that the film is supposed to have some kind of message but i have watched the movie several ways and have not found anything even vaguely redeembrbr the script in the first part is pretty good,1
if it hadn't come with the trailer i think it would have been nice to have a more detailed discussion concerning the plot before the movie starts,1
hamill does an excellent job with his dramatic character development,0
if you do n't think the movie is interesting then the read rule 's book,0
only the first two films have been really bad and i'm looking at you,1
without a doubt this is one of the bestlooking chinese historical kungfu epic ever madebr br but alas tsui hark has n't improved much in the writing department and the story and dialog are rather juvenile,0
its not very deep but it certainly isn't your basic horror film,1
another thing which i liked about the film in particular were two people who were very good in their rolesbr br i do like japanese cinema at some points,1
stanley and iris' is a heart warming film about two people who find each other and help one another overcome their problems in life,0
gregg ackroyns is quite funny as the wise old man in charge but he did not fit the character of a wannafear to maurizoid,1
the music is excellent especially for her and her father but the story is not that good and it is more of a mystery,1
because of this movie i do now but i'm not so sure that 's a good thing,0
a departure from his normal adventurefantasy fare it paved the way for his 1993 success schindler 's listbr br based upon alice walder 's pulitzer prize winning novel the story concerns a young girl 's arranged marriage of hardship to a brutal angry farmer and her painful separation from her beloved younger sister nettie,0
the soundtrack is great with inspiring rock eg,0
it 's an impressive portrayal and having greg kinear to ground him is just poetic,0
for example when the girl is walking around naked this woman suddenly comes on television and the viewer sees it too,1
the women were strangers and yet got along well enough to spend the time they did in the villa in italy,0
that shows it 's the same sad story repeating itself the same unfaithful woman like alexandre says who appears endlessly and unfaithful is for proust the higher point in love which makes it exist but which also underlines its illusionsbr br art is what causes the passage between what 's outside the illusion of love to what 's inside which is the truth and is a learning of this truth,0
and even though the movie is just a movie of sorts this is still a very good movie,1
of the entire book there are four parts,1
it is the only movie that really has got the characters as realistic or more realistic than this,1
though he seems to be a bit of a goof but he 'esn't bad either he has a great scene as well,1
i was blown away but you 'll come out smiling having enjoyed a good film,0
we know why you're there but why are there nations,1
some of it was funny but making jokes of willy and al 's senility was not,0
the music of the movie was fantastic and i've never heard the soundtrack of a movie on television,1
an insomniac 's nightmare is the story of a man 's plunge into insanity,0
another problem is that the plot is not developed enough to bring the story to a full point and is never fully developed at the end,1
the shots were great,0
yes the plot is so original but it does not make any impression on you,1
his life is really a dream not a happy and optimistic one so a lot happens to the people in the film but he does it as a happy human he loves his wife and child and the world is always better and better for this man,1
it'stales in comparison but not in a very good way,1
one last question is this the first time that i have ever seen someone on danny'sandra and she've been pretty much dead for 30 years,1
besides i find it to be a little to kiddy when a group of teddy bears with bows and arrows can defeat a squadron of storm troopers with laser guns and mighty machinerybr br all in all return of the jedi is a very good movie but the fact that richard marquand is a less accomplished director than irvin kershner does that the overall feel of the movie is less than brilliant,0
that is a bad movie but a good one,1
i was also surprised at how mediocre this movie was,0
there 's the idiotic principal mr bip the nervous maths teacher and many others,0
i understand that the creators of this show wanted to use the star power that these guys have,0
the sad ending with a glimpse of hope for the sad woman who lost her true love is sweet but if the man continued to live would that last,0
it 's full of kids who know authority does n't have the correct answers,0
i have seen it several times in my short 19 years,0
their father is reverend maclean and they grow up with his lessons that has to do with religion and the lessons of flyfishing,0
you might want someone else at the office to help you out as some of this stuff is out there it 'll just get old quickly for you but just remember that this is not just a comedy,1
what else can you say about this movie,1
it're easy to see why it was released in its day but at its heart it're a story,1
for this viewer these scenes are of utmost importance and director villaronga is to be applauded for his perseverance and bravery in making this story so intense,0
the acting was superb especially in the scene where randy and paul are getting ready,1
terribly made,1
it 'll have you begging to please save our society 'just for that'spoiler warning br so i'm sorry but if anything this is my first movie made with the intention of making a horror movie,1
br br the worst part about this movie is the actors playing robocops,1
sam hits close to home is lovely to look at and so much fun to play along with,0
yet alexandre is shown to be as chauvinistic and jealous as any other man,0
89 years old and just like that he dies of nothing' willy says of one old songwriting friend before deciding the man probably died from writing a song that rhymed lady with babybr br burns won an oscar for his understated performance as the gentle but steely lewis but it 's matthau who brings this one home his makeup and proud but ragged bearing really selling you on the idea he was already 73 when he made this,0
you 'll also notice that the actors are the only reason they do have money,1
through some pretty brutal scenes we are treated to a lot for the movie to see but it feels like you are watching the same actors act for the same material over and over again without understanding anything until the very last frame or two,1
the chemistry between shahid amrita is awesomebr br stuff like sanctity in a marriagerelationship avoiding courtship mutual respect care space waiting for getting married officially prayingsacrficing for ur beloved all these and more get showcased in vivah,0
the story must 've later inspired by the mid90s comedy detroit rock city which some minor character changes in the vehicle for aged glam rockers kizzbr br i would recommend passing on the corey feldman vehicle rock n' roll high school forever released nearly a decade later,0
that final scene is one of the most glorious and uplifting final scenes to a movie i have ever seen,0
it took me a while for my attention the rest just seemed outofplace,1
for my money i wouldn't be shocked if this guy turned to other movies,1
read my lips opens the floor for discussion not just with the characters but the situations,0
he and his friends take their kids on holiday and spend the night in a mansion in chico,1
i enjoyed itbr br people have skulls thicker than ned 's helmet if they go to see a movie like this and expect it to be a documentary,0
seeing him at the end of the picture you can see he've got some sortof power,1
annie is addicted to drugs alcohol and bad boys and is beaten up by her father,0
these carefully executed strangelooking visual techniques underline that we are in a dreamreality we are hypnotized the universe of europa is not real,0
sonny alex was a little better as a reporter for the newspaper and her role was limited,1
this is really one of those rare gems that i don't have the time or the patience even to sit thru the entire first half hour without thinking for a moment about why a killer whale is attacking or what it 'll do,1
carla works for a property developer 's where she excels in being unattractive unappreciated and desperate,0
the two have nothing in common,0
this movie had the most annoying storyline i ever seen and i could n generation a few times in fact had to finish it,1
from the old melbourne gaol where he was hanged to the post office he held up in jerilderie,0
on the surface this may sound rather silly from the outset but when you consider that rko does provide the film itself with a fairly interesting and interesting plot the film is a much more enjoyable and complex film than most of its fellow westerners give it credit of course but that may have been due to budgetary restraints from rko and production values at least as i 'll now say that there is absolutely nothing wrong with some very special effects,1
brains who were also in love at this pointbrains who were both dead before this happened,1
i like the way they had the street to themselves and that there was no one else around and also what i though was interesting is that they did n't close down a caf to set there gear and that they did it all from a police station,0
it shows us the lives of those that are trapped between two worlds,1
interesting characters lots of tension,0
the man in the black suit gives him money to replace the milk,0
plus i really liked the fact that the director did nnedethere is no story about this film or the characters and the acting was ok,1
all of these actors are the best,1
there is so much happening on the screenyou simply wo n't believe,0
the only reason i gave 910 does that because it 'es really boring and a little bit silly,1
i watched it as soon as i got home but i had to watch it again because i kept missing a few parts the first time,0
due to reading bad reviews and being told by friends that they could n't believe how bad it was i did n't go and see this film at the cinema,0
cliff hudens plays a cop who has been in prison only a couple years,1
suffice to say that turturro is magnificent as an eccentric obsessive and deeply vulnerable chess genius and em matches him step for step as the strongminded woman who is drawn to him,0
it was so much fun to watch and you couldn't help but enjoy the ride,1
he later encounters june riding a bicycle and instantly matches the body with the voice,0
initially that is the only reason i watched it and then that was only because it had a great story line and the cast were also excellent,1
it was a pretty good story with solid actors and plot,1
the conversations between ben and soll are the best in the movie they have real chemistry,0
it 's definitely up there in standards surpassing bored of the rings and on par with movies like harry potter,0
oddly this isn't a very accurate comparisonbr br the film 'is like a movie of the early '70ixties but the story is much more modern and takes place around the world,1
do n't say i did n't warn you but your gonna laugh,0
alas i wasn't expecting anything like that,1
for anyone who likes this film they should try to take the time and read the other reviews before comparing,1
it 's got everything,0
there are many allusions to the german fanaticism of adherence to such stupid detailsbr br the railway journey is like an allegory representing man 's procession through life with all its trials and tribulations,0
wouldn't it be great if the rest of the film focused on a few of keaton'skills and then ended up with this scene,1
grandpa is an oldfashioned story with a very special feel to it,1
coming from the man who brought this show to the tv channel where i am a huge admirere it is difficult for the writers to do anything different or even come across as something uniquebrights are nigh on impossible,1
may he have to go back at least to live some morebr br there you go,1
de nero is just a good guy who does everything for everyone,1
one night he arrives back home to find marina pregnant,1
to say too much more about the story which has many twists would be a mistakebr br the most interesting thing about this film for me is how sound is used to indicate when carla can hear and when she ca n't a sort of point of hear,0
how exciting is that,0
at the end there is one small scene during one night but the movie just doesn't do it justice,1
by the time it was over in 2003 the two stories seemed to have coalesced about once more,1
a choice treat all the way around,0
a magnetic attraction evolves whereby he proposes the next day the mother alarmed telegrams the husband,0
every shot of him on screen,1
the doctor sketch that matthau and burns do is directly from their materialbr br and i do think you will like the sunshine boys,0
it was a nice little film on the subject but that was the best part of it,1
the acting here was bad and the film was a bad remake on a very lowbudget,1
this was a great movie,1
or in a climax using the sabre to break off his own father 's arm during the final sabre fight with sith vaderbr br you probably know the ewoks celebration after the death star was blown complete with a short display of fireworks drumming on the spoils of victory and luke finally meeting up with leia after luke 's own nemesisdarth vader now dead is burned on a pyre,0
in fact the only movie that really surprised people was it 'alas it was the first one,1
even with all the tricks in my opinion this film is the most complete real and moving piece of cinema then most of the films on the top 250 list,0
ah,1
definitely one of the best films of the 80'sspace,1
his massacre of col fannin 's men at goliad was inexcusable,0
in fact i have done a youtube video about it for you to explore the winning combination in detail enjoy,0
characters in this series are mostly uncharacters which makes them even more annoying and annoying,1
his wife is dying,1
then i turned it off because i found out it actually made a better movie,1
it made no sense and i had no clue what to make out what was going through her face,1
this was definitely the best film i have seen in a long long while i watched this film over five years i'm sure you've seen it many times as well as many others,1
by the way i would also add you all a treat to watch to see the first time the movie comes out in theaters,1
the epic scenes were believable,0
muppets are involved,0
whoever was behind the film would surely be able to predict their actions and thoughts without having to know what was being projected as they were making their way through the maze on foot at night,1
before i read any of it've heard from other people that this film is not quite as good as i thought it was i am a big fan of the original movies and enjoyed the remake but this one is not quite as good for one of my personal tastes,1
it 's a good movie but not one of their best,0
this was very good,1
i watch i love lucy from time to time and love it but never have i read or seen a biography never knew anything about their lives off the screen,0
he seems more like lisa,1
too late,1
it was very interesting to see how the movie was made,1
after the fact there is absolutely nothing new here,1
we just ca,1
ok now that i think of 'em i can see why people are still getting tired of hollywood fudging everything else out on the screen but this must do it,1
the first 2 films have that dirty livedin look with all the technology and so forth,0
nothing is acceptable that does not fit santa anna 's wishes or activities,0
lars von trier shows that old styles of filming can produce marvellous cinema and build drama and tension,0
released during the aftermath of world war 2 this colourful romantic adventure would have provided just the tonic for a traumatised recovering nation in need of a good upliftbr br following a string of other patriotic war films 'the archers' made this one their quirkiest skittish and most patriotic of the lot,0
but eustache 's point if not entirely message is that it 's practically impossible to have it both ways you ca n't have people love you and expect to get the satisfaction of ultimate companionship that arrives with fing as the characters refer over and over again,0
scarlett fonda was a wonderful role,1
this is a legitimate question but according to the reverend the church answers all mysteries,0
doubtlessly a special story about the ambiguity of existence,0
in fact this film runs rings around scream,0
in the film dillon 'll be the king'revelation for this century,1
with those dark circles under his eyes the frail wee thing looks unlikely to survive the hourbr br this is a delightful heartwarming version of the holiday classic,0
sammo has to have a 10 out of 10 for this movie as it has everything,0
some of her scenes are very cheesy like a scene after a car was driven off a cliff and after some stupid dialog,1
the sleazy and relentless ormond who by the way also ransacked gallico 's once beloved wife takes off with the buzz saw trick and programs it in the show of gallico 's rival the great rinaldi,0
still i think what fennie says to max is very unnecessary and tones the potential of the whole segment and its themes down pretty effectively unfortunatelybr br but then we get to the thing the film makers were interested the most in,0
but as it turns out this is not the case as i would have expected and it is very disturbing to see an adult be so obsessed with violence,1
i can recommend it for everybody,0
the beauty of the movie is the dance that robert deniro and jane fonda do together starting and stopping before each has the skills and courage to completely trust each other and move on,0
who was that short little guy when she finds out she faints,0
the final battle over endor is very well made both in terms of the general effects and tension wise,0
a lot of his roles though were weak spineless characters,0
having watched this movie at least 50 times i can find no fault in it,0
natalia 's rift with her mother comes across a churlish disagreement by the mother rather than a dramatic flashpoint in the film,0
its a blend of horror and drama and romance not so much comedy,0
transitions from the past are often made with a sense of timing but the real beauty of the film is the way the film keeps moving forward and the emotional journey is never boring and the story never becomes tiresively boringbrillah,1
the parents fit snugly into their roles,0
in that sense it very nicely gives us a good view of how life often is thus being credible,0
i mean with this crowd and the title of stardust i knew what to expectbr br oh how sweetly wrong i wasbr br yes it is a fairy tale written by an author famed in comic bookdom,0
and what kind of movie is that anywaybray is just so bad it 'll make you think you can't laugh anymore at it,1
margaritas and cock br br this tremendously entertaining film grabs you from the opening scene and never stops delivering laughs surprises and unexpectedly touching moments,0
but in my opinion the film 's charm comes from marius goring as conductor 71 he by far has the most interesting role filling each of his scenes with his innocent lightheartedness brightening the film,0
if he was totally gone his partner marley would never have come for his sake in the first place,0
and they are still living the old days when we had the internet and everything was available to us from internet video,1
the acting is great especially james cagney who makes the movie a true pleasure to watch,1
that is not what i thought when one movie was done that i thought was the best,1
photographs of albeniz reappear throughout the program connecting the passion of the music to its great creator,0
how do they get people like tony and michael to come in this and act,1
but in this he completely branches out and is someone else for once,0
when i was a kid i watched this many times over and i remember whistling the happy cat song quite often,0
it would be an insult to the rest because of some lame and pointless subplot,1
i only saw half but i loved what i saw,0
the running joke of the kingdom 's history of prince savagery and the aftermath the way indulging in magic effects the witch and dozens of smart little touches all kept me enthralled,0
make no mistake this is her picturemr gazzara concedes it to her most self effacingly in all their scenes together,0
the way that the screen jumps and flashes when you get hit its very realistic while at the same time you have to remember that its just a game and your not really there,0
this movie grabbed my interest after the first 5 minutes and would never let it go,0
our hero falls in love with his daughter who later turns out to be a member of the werewolf nazi postwar terrorists,0
also notable are some excellent supporting roles that are the only positive things of this movie,1
with a new cast a fresh script a fresh set of plot lines the entire movie is very funnybr br not everyone is in love with their hero but everyone is in love with him in his day,1
not everything is what it seems,0
he could play delightful old codgers authority figures and in this case a particularly nasty and crafty villain,0
i really enjoyed this thriller,0
my wife kate and i absolutely loved the series and ca n't wait for the next one,0
just because the story line and the direction is very weak we are not as satisfied as we deserved,0
it is interesting to see the similarities between the two and the other reviewers here for examplebrillant and funny but not for everybodybrillantly entertaining,1
mostly because of the way this movie portrays the war in europa,1
which it definitely had,1
its the kind of a movie what i despite most,0
also you will always like this one since it is so sad that so many so called actors went to the movies,1
if they tried again they would have been burned,1
but it seems like everyone in town was the same kind of lovable loser in this flick from the startbr br i have seen this movie in a theater all over town in my time and never seen it again,1
i enjoy all the versions of this story but this one is my all time favorite,0
no preconception,0
much of what is made of this film are uninteresting,1
back story is about a middle aged woman who 'feats the system and lives in a mental house which has been condemned,1
for one thing this film has no plot,1
you cant get this right for a movie about a guy who is sexually attracted to female soldiers,1
the scene where they try to drive home is the highlight of the entire movie a scene where diane and her family meet with josh,1
it takes a compassionate intelligent and spiritual person to really grasp the meaning,0
no one believes me even though i did,1
simon'sammy the only woman in this movie that i could give him a hug for,1
gorgeous talented and popular these are performers to look out forbr br ok where do i start,0
yes i thought andy macdowell was great,0
it wasn't a very good film with all of that bad acting and cheesy dialogue and the best part was that it had lots of gore but the plot did a lot to keep it from getting to a conclusion,1
the whole thing was an attempt at making it more interesting and more dramatic,1
ever since i've heard it was supposed as another film of michael bay 'the black widow ',1
everytime i watch it i think about the people that are there so i can't really blame them at all because i think these kids would have done very very very well in the world if they were here,1
br br keeping with the magic of the moment peter by oversight of his conductor 71 whose job it was to transport him to the 'other world' escapes death and finds himself stranded on a beach,0
you ca vie with my eyes,1
this sensitive visually beautiful film is based on a story by vladimir nabokov and captures well that writer 's dark irony,0
subtlety of plot was not the point they made but the film was so ridiculous and unrealistic that it became unbearable,1
she had to change the channel to dundemusique which caused the entire film to be switched to english and it've been said that this is meant by the english language but i think the fact is this is the only film that has the english subtitlesbr br anyway do nstka don't make these type of jokes anymore,1
the actors have been chosen for the roles they play and if your going to give the worst i'm afraid you need to choose a bunch that 'll make you laugh for 90 minutes,1
the cast was a little overdramatic,1
the second movie in this one is nope,1
when he does n't understand the world anymore in his rage he blows up a railroad bridge under a train which he just savedbr br as a final note for historical correctness in the real world the werewolf were nowhere as important as the film implies they were mostly a final nazi propaganda coup,0
the main villain is played by the legendary actor fritz lang,1
these are some immediate grandiose descriptions that come to mind when thinking of lars von trier 's 1991 masterpiece europa the final chapter of the europa trilogy,0
kevin bacon seems a little reluctant to try new things but in the end the two of them become friends,1
the music of albeniz pervades this film,0
and as his background is established it affords the insights that allow the audience to more fully understand who luzhin is and how he got to this point in his life,0
as mentioned earlier michael o'sheen the most important directorial producer has nashville in his film collection,1
anyone interested in a good laugh will do,1
danny glover lends solid support though his moses was a superior turn for him in places in the heart,0
it can skip background information go too fast in some places too slow in others etc,0
this was by far one the worst movies i have had the misfortune ever to seebrat least it had a decent start it ended up being an average movie,1
the boys grow up and get into trouble with their pranks fight to see who is tougher and do the things brothers do all the while attending church and taking part in all other spiritual matters like flyfishing,0
the only reason he 'll be at all useful is a special appearance from one of his old favorites josh roberts in which his wife takes up residence,1
ghost story is a terrific horror story,0
this movie was so bad in my opinion that i had to leave the theater,1
much of it has been rereleased on videotape and it has become the subject matter '80 minutes a day that is so popular it was never released on a d v v recorderbrbr i had an opportunity this week to watch the show with the lovely sara who was born after cinna was discovered and she brought me her best wishes for the show to be released in the us to be viewed,1
we have a lot more scenes with the girls that we never see in a feature or even a film,1
nor do we expect much from a film set by a man whose life is a bit of a mystery,1
none of the characters seemed interested in trying or wanting to become famous,1
the best part about the film is that it does nishit me in every way possible to make you care for the boy and love the dog as much as you want,1
so i heard a second one was made and i had to watch itbr br what really makes this movie work is judd nelson 's character and the sometimes clever script,0
after a series i had seen for a while i just decided it was time to put it aside,1
it're like an old muppet movie,1
the boys have excluded a young girl about their age from taking part in their gamesbr br when we meet the adult ramallo again he is on his way to a sanatorium,0
directed by the star of films such as chain reaction the ring bourne identity i had to gamble with this even if it was rubbish but it were n't at all i found some of the humour quite funny especially alfred molina the star of spiderman 2 the character doc ock,0
it 's about love and obsession rather than the venerated board game and after drawing me in gradually over the first half hour became totally compelling,0
once again proving his amazing versatility john turturro plays the introspective russian chess genius preparing for a comeback tournament and forging an unlikely relationship with a gadabout fellow resident at a 1920 's italian hotel,0
it really was a great movie,1
it 'll have you on the edge of your seat until that very moment with the end ending to be a bit ironic,1
if anything this film is a lot more than just a lowbudget production,1
this movie tries at all costs,1
i am 19 years old now,0
but it turns out she 'll not have to fight anymore and she're on the case,1
the first time i watched it upon its theatrical release i thought it was pretty awfuli gave it a 4 out of 10 the equivalent of an f letter grade,0
you can see real people behind the unreal lines,0
how could they miss this,1
not only amanda becomes a lesbian but she also becomes increasingly frustrated by the life she has become and the fact she spends time in a closeted mental ward,1
for those who think it'stole something from me why did the writers write these lame plotlines,1
what kind of word are we living in,0
but the main thing that got my interest from this movie i do not understand,1
surely noone with a sense of the humor of the 20'ssixties can come close to making such material as this even slightly funnybr br the plot in most of these comedy specials is fairly simple,1
the main story however is more like a stage play,1
we do n't read that much anymore instead people want to see movies,0
in the case it was more a sequel to an already established film than a rehashbr br so in terms a true classic,1
we next find out that his trusted employees are anything but that,0

what the script failed to mention is that the main actors are both really well made and all look and act so perfectly that it makes every scene and line look greatbr br it seemed like the filmmakers could nancy the main actors into something special but they chose not but instead just gave the actors what could only happen to them in their real livesbrice cochnale was not as good as her first movie roles and her scenes were only slightly better,1

this movie should be used by everyone and is a fantastic movie,1
in some ways you've done better watching an actual movie,1
even though i was an idiot for writing a 1 movie i still thought it was worth getting to see,1

which is saying a lot for a movie again made on a fraction of the budget of these international hitsbr br one thing i really love about this movie is that it so stretches the envelope of adventure movie to come out of hong kong,0
but this is not something you simply take from one movie but from the rest,1

this movie is worth looking at first time if not for the acting though i couldn't find one,1
i thought the husband definitely had something to do with it for surebr br just got the lifetime movie network for christmas and am loving these movies,0
the movie was full of stereotypes and all the stereotypical characters,1
yet none of this could have happened if it were n't for our characters,0
the acting is a little cheesy and the quality of film is not great either but for a really low budget film its good,0
there is compassion within him but he holds it below everything else and is very self involved,0

the album is also good if you can find it and still have a record player to play it on,0
i saw this movie on comedy central a few times,0
ugh,1
nicely done,1
most notably there 'll be no need for a female lead or even to go as far back as his childhood years in the 60ss to fill the lead roles that would have been available for him in the original filmsbras you 'll see the film is pretty much devoid in most respects in the style it had a lot going for this movie it 'll stick with you for a while and it will become as familiar as the opening credits,1
the film has just one thing on mind to go out on a bang,0
well i just have a feeling that it is,1
her only crime is her husband,1
that is because it is not based upon any real historybranagh is the first film he made that was as funny as his own,1
family and friends feel the same way about it,0
okay there was not one line of dialogue here that i have been forced to watch,1
if anyone has seen it or liked the movie or anyone who loved it i do not know anyone who would like it i would like to go see it,1
you have these three people who are trying for a job and then have to face the odds,1

after a successful run on the golden globes and a few more movies with better performances it 'll make good on its promise to bring out the best in bollywood,1
although one ca n't say their characters are well developed that does n't make them any less funnybr br the version i saw was on hdnet and had subtitles for the spanish dialog so that was certainly not a problem,0
the actors are so bad in most episodes where they play dumb characters like the bad guys but as the plot develops they become more and less likable,1
most of the action takes a lot of time with no action scenes that are interesting to the audience,1
he traveled around performing his compositions which are a kind of beautiful standardization of spanish rhythms and melodies not as homogenized as ravel 's bolero but moving in that direction,0
this makes no sense given the singular specialness of this film perhaps the best neil simon ever wrotebr br walter matthau plays willy clark once half of a legendary vaudeville comedy known as lewis and clark now a bitter 73yearold solo act who ca n't get a job in a potato chip commercial,0
how can i say this was a good movie,1
the story was interesting but the story of the film was so lame,1
but she tries,0

so he goes with some other people and they both like him,1
you know what they say about you in the backwoods,1
also the sound is poor,1
to say he was good would be an insult to his skills,1
although there is no way to know how much time that takes to shoot you 'll never guess it since i do nnot think anyone has spent a lot of money on a computergenerated shot like this but i must tell you to never spend 100 to see it,1
this film 'creates a sense and feeling that is very much out of place and out of place on this film itself,1
i think the only reason it was so awesome was because of the ramones,0

eustache himself committed suicide in 1981 and the reallife person that the character marie was based on did too,0
however i can never think of a worse film of his,1
as a child growingup i was very scared to watch horror when i was about ten years old when a tv series first aired in the fall of 1981 at the request of my uncle who knew the story well,1
part of the enjoyment that i took from this film stemmed from the fact that i knew nothing more about it than that it starred john turturro and emily watson was a period piece and involved chess,0
it is all about the action and adventure,0
having written over five hundred reviews i have never found myself at such a loss of words as i did with director jacques audiard 's subtle yet inspirational love story,0

this film was a big surprise when i first viewed it and i look forward to seeing it again,0
indeed scifi fans have created their own versions of episodes vii viii and ix in their heads over and over again,0
the film works is n't trying to work as history but rather is a deconstruction of 1940s war movies,0
but a river runs through it is the story about all generations,0
just how long does the movie stretch before i feel compelled to throw up,1
the situations of family interactions portrayed are real and you smile when you find yourself in place of one of the characters,0
the technicolor photography somewhat subdued and not garish at all is excellent and the way it shifts into bw for the heavenly sequences is done with great imagination and effectivenessbr br the opening scene is the sort that really draws a viewer into the fantasy aspects of the storyand niven 's tense talk with radio operator hunter while his plane is crashing toward earth unexpectedly leads to a memorable romantic encounter,0
but i think that all the good reviews of the movie did not really have anything positive,1
you just feel it,1
oprah winfrey also made her film debut here and gives a great performance as sofia one of those friends' of celie,0
this is one of the most beautifully filmed movies ever and there is a wild imagination in its style,0
warning this film contains spoiler,1
maybe it 's the idea that there is good in everyone and that therefore no one is beyond redemption that appeals to me but for whatever reason i never miss an opportunity to watch one of the many screen adaptations of this timeless classic when they 're on tv as they inevitably are this time of yearbr br what makes this version really stand out is the somber gravitas that the cast bring to their respective roles,0
whatever the reason a film which has a lot of bad points is almost never good at allbradley is the usual awful character and i am sure most would rather have seen him as the mean bully that he was,1
what 'll happen next,1
general khan 'alokshah had to be in a much better role since i expected a lot,1
he is a movie critic so for him to say this tells me something,0
thank you santa,1
and the fact you can have a movie that're not good and still try your damn best to get more than 1 minute in your mind is absolutely disgustingbr,1
the first five minutes were pretty good considering all the effort,1
during the course this film is treated to several very memorable performances by the young characters in the filmbr br this is one of those rare films where one of the stars was very attractive and quite capable,1
it seemed like they kept the plot out till midway,1
br br i believe that great movies pull you inside a world make you a part of it and then drop you off to talk about with your friends over coffee or a drink,0
br br the film also had a very positive outcome,1
by the end little al learns some hard lessons about the reality of war and the requisite suffering and sacrificebr br i loved this oav series with its cool mecha designs involving story and likeable characters,0
this sammo film has it all romance drama excitement and a great hero as well,0
the nominated director producer actor is a visionary who deserves to be praised for his advancement not only in the cinema in the us but around the world,0
but the only thing that kept it from getting anything was that it made me think that in a way it was an interesting premise brat or what,1
however it is a movie that've always held my interest i guess and to the degree i'm an avid viewer of movies i tend not necessarily buy everything at my video rental outlet,1
of course for someone like darry shearer it is obvious it was his film,1
by my criteria this is a pretty decent movie but only for a very small number of people,1
it is not good and i feel like watching a film with no intention,1
undying used the unreal engine but had very little resemblance to that game when it came to actual gameplay,0
although not all of the characters seem to have a real connection they still fit the type that are meant for the storybr br i've been an indie film fan ever since i was 14 and i love my films as long i'm around indie film producers in my home state of sahina and ca n b b that being the fact that my family has worked to make a lot more films for me now than the past decade,1
br br the movie also has an excellent soundtrack that includes jacobi 'll be back on his rock rock show,1
surely one of the best british films ever made if not one of the best films ever made anywhere,0
910 the first and last time i saw this movie and that 'll have to wait,1

first of all the film shows some very old stuff but it 'll be obvious it've all been done before,1

since we have a good oldfashioned videostore in tucson i had the chance to watch this 3 12hour marathon masterwork that is not boring for ten secondsbr br since we speak here about one of the most discussed movies of all times let me tell you my impression that the endless dialogs originally typical for the early nouvelle vague of a jacques rivette or alain resnais appear almost ridiculous in this movie,0
some may have thought it was just boring for such a long time but this flick was just fantastic,1

oscarcaliber work by everyone involved both in front of and behind the camera,0
he knows that if the kids do nn't go away he will take them back,1
the problem of all this i think is there is a lot more story to follow here and then the writers wouldn't even give the main story such an important plot,1
and while these mysteries are explained in the course of the story their unfolding seems somewhat contrived,0
it 'll only be one more reason for a person not going see it,1
let 's hope for a good future,0
firstly i'm not a big dvd release critic though in fact i 'think that is what i enjoy about this film it 'll not surprise you,1

she is been excellent in main ho on na and ishk vishk but may be she could 've put little more in the role,0
serious kudos to her ca n't wait to see more,0
my favourite line would be 'i feel like a bangkok hooker on a sunday after the navy left town',0
but within that basic outline the story is lively and imaginative,0
the ending is so predictable yet so effective that you actually wonder why someone would actually give this a chance,1
makes me wish this movie was more than once and perhaps even then,1
but during the movie she really convinces you that she 's psychotic or at least that there 's something seriously wrong with her,0
ultimately i gave the movie a 4 out 10,1
only if you like korean cinema,1
antonio martinelli was the man behind the mask for the original and here he've brought that classic style into a whole another levelbr br the action really works in this movie as the bad guys are able only to run offscreen with weapons that will explode at any moment,1
if you have never seen the movie see the film and see its power in its simplicity alone and also its simplicity as a film,1
both were very realistic and realistic as well,1
this afternoon we took the kids to the movies and saw neil gaimans stardust and all i can say is wowbr br it is rare that i am completely taken aback by anything but this is quite possibly the greatest fantasy movie i have ever seen maybe even the best movie of any kind and it is all neil gaiman 's faultbr br sure i could have been sucked in by the wonderful dialog which was smart flowed smoothlyand made the characters completely believablebr br i could go on for days about the spectacular acting charlie cox is perfect as tristan claire daines is brilliant as yvaine and robert di nero almost steals the movie as the deeply in the closet pirate captian shakespearebr br the pure joy brought about by the humor which managed to be laugh our loud funny intelligent enough to make the first shrek look like an 80 's sitcom and blend in perfectly with the rest of the movie alone would have made this a great moviebr br special effects were near perfect true this was no lotr or star wars sf extravaganza but where they were use they were exactly what was called for not too much to distract you from the movie itself and blended into the story perfectlybr br then there is the story,0
if you want to see what it'ss the other half of the movie look no further,1
a complete talebr br think of blue as all the things in between the 14 scenes in yellow that you did n't see that is a complete tale on it 's ownbr br essentially they are parallel films the same story told in two different waysbr br it was n't until i saw the first 30 minutes of blue that i fully understood yellowbr br i hope this was helpful for people who are being discouraged by various influences because this film changed the way i looked at filmbr br thanks for your time,0
i see the same idea used in dancer in the dark where bjork 's character does n't speak up for herself and ends up being her own destruction,0
first we are back on the desert planet tatooine and then we are watching them face another death star,0
the plot is simple and simple but is really well done by michael pare,1
the police seem to be involved in a losing battle,0
the romance aspect is there although the movie seems much darker than its predecessor,0
the other problem is some of this has already been done in hong kil ha,1
little else on show is so well written the dialogue is just so good and the cinematography is absolutely great too it'scary stuff,1

there is only a couple scenes that really do deserve this grade because as others pointed it can get boring with more than one point,1

ledgers performance in the title role is quite solid taking the mantle of cinema 's best ned bob chitty a great footballer but a poor actor,0
other than that this is an absolutely perfect blend of action drama suspense comedy horror and horrorbr br well worth the lookbr the acting varies depending in style from the actors to the actors at one point or their spouses to the actresses all of them are believable,1
good thing he is not,1
this was not a film about love and friendship either,1
the only thing that keeps me watching is the music and the fact that the entire thing is very creepy in its dark atmosphere,1
i love that they used cgi,0
this movie is about the search for and the search of a good old fashioned christmas car chase,1
the screenplay borrows elements from hitchcock most notably rear window where carla 's lipreading talent comes into full play using a pair of binoculars,0

in fact the script was written before this film was even made,1
the opening flourishes left me purring with delight at their inventiveness the altered version of the archers' logo the introductory disclaimer the way the camera pans over the cosmos,0
this isn't much of a challenge in this role,1
brilliance starts with the main character rick walsh playing a man obsessed with the occult and living with his mother mary in a rural area,1

after seeing so many gundam series movies and ovas i was completely ready for a civilianesquire movie,0
alok nath is such a terrific actor so open with the emotions of the characters he portrays he almost steals the show from the young stars,0
he is good,1
some people may like it but the truth behind this crap should be shown to everybody who likes itbr br i gave this film 2 thumbs up,1
by the end of the film i felt the same as i did when i first saw the bbc production of pride and prejudice i was yearning for the characters to find what they were looking for whether it was isolation peace liberty or love,0
byron and james were quite good and had the best lines but it wouldn't have even been considered a tv show to me if i was n 'the guy from the doctor''brad pitt'scout of life is not a film for kids,1
by far her most famous performance is at least 10 years after this film,1
unlike hollywood productions this is a psychological suspense yarn where the people look like the everyday man and woman on the street where a punch in the face or groin sounds like a sickening thud and where the office is a place to be feared,0
the special effects were not spectacular there was no realistic gore nothing memorable about the movie whatsoever,1
watching this show was like taking a breath of fresh air amid tv schedule filled with reality shows and boring reruns,0
first al had little habits such as accidentally spitting slightly when pronouncing words beginning with the letter t and slightly jabbing willie with his index finger on stage,0
i thought all the good fairy tales had already been told,0
the days is a typical family drama with a little catch you must relate to the character 's emotions in every way possible in order for you to truly appreciate the showbr br br br the story obviously for all the people who has watched the show is the world of cooper day the middle child of the family,0
the plot is really weak and the jokes do become silly as wellbrained at times and i don't particularly agree,1
spielberg 's first dramatic film is no letdown,0
from the opening credits the movie was very very tense and very well done,1
this is one hell and a million dollars short of something truly incrediblebr br what a movie,1
for riget fans this should n't be so big difference if the animation will be done in good way average 'watcher' will consider it normal just after first few shots of the movie,0
they convince her to make the film and at the preview she is a great success,0
her exstudent is cute enough still carrying a crush on his teacher for so long,0
this motion picture has a steady haunting pace backed up with great acting and a story that is revealed to us over timebr br beyond that the music fully establishes the mood and assists in maintaining an uneasy cautious and somber tonebr br weir 's story is enhanced by using aboriginals their stories and their tensions with the dominant white population to deliver a fantasy tale that is ominousbr br although they are unrelated in story as well as genre this maintained the same feeling within me as ursula le guin 's lathe of heaven,0
if they ever recut and trim the film this side story should be condensedbr br a story about two extremely disparate girls bonding and helping each other is hardly a novel idea and ryan could have easily steered this film into clich and predictability,0
love her too because of your love,1
the plot is about a girl named alena who runs away from the mob as a child and is pursued by the law with her mother who keeps her in her room and her sisters who also escape,1
it was as though someone made his own mindup about this fact,1
br br my print was perfect,0
jag r nyfiken yellow is a lot of fun,0
worst episode i 'll ever watchbrilliance by peter and the rest of the cast is absolutely terrible,1
when they were going through the motions they were able only to get their heads hurt from the bad guy,1
this was one stupid movie that made me laughbr br the acting was very good the movie reminded you of halloween but you have only got to watch this movie once,1
i felt there was much more than meets the eye,0
danny glover should have also gotten at least nominated for his role in this film,0
what he does naughten is make a fool of himself into an adult man by doing itbrillie 'is out of luck with the real man so she goes for a sleaze with someone else,1
and in a very funny way she 'just didn't want me,1
these characters are more or less real to the character,1
michelle pfiefer is making quite a splash with her recent returns to the screen,0
maybe i wrong and in that case i 'll be happy to know my mistakes so take the and notify me,0
iphone video is the best,1
this film is worth seeing for the action scenes and the characterizationsbr br i can safely say this has the worst writing acting and directing i've seen,1
they are nameless individuals who never existed in their lives and we never hear their names until the end which is quite surprising since i knew nothing about this film other than a couple years into it and i was just too frightened to tell anyone except the two lead actors,1
the special is not special,1
it was also very difficult for me for me a lot to identify with as a teenager,1
yes it're cheesy yes there're some moments in the first half that make sense yes the cast gets to play their parts well and yes a good few of these scenes weren't made worse by being shot on video,1
something tells us you might be better a better artist than you are,1
however it still managed to shock people,1
this film is just a very very very very disappointing movie,1
feelgood fantasy,0
the space battles towards the end are very impressivebr br ultimately this film coasts to success based on the accomplishments of its forebears,0
the acting in general i found a little lacking,1
at this point i do not know why i think the critics are so critical of meryl streth,1
the story is a mixture of clich clich,1
but i think that in real world the director and producer should be commended for their ability to not give the movie a bad bad name and keep it going,1
being a male i'm probably not qualified to totally understand it but they do a nice job of establishing the restrictive victorian environment from the start,0
thanks for viewing it,1
maybe its the fact that this is a remake of the book and has little or no resemblance to realitybrudolph glover plays a wealthy german nobleman named georgia karloff and also a wealthy noble man german businessman steve martini plays a wealthy german nobleman george bauerbr br there're some nice twists to this film too,1
i gave it an 8 only because it had received such low votes this is definitely really about a 55 ummm it was kind of bloody had likeable shallow characters and it had some really hot babes in it,0
oh and no i 'll start right off with that one girl who looks great in this,1
godard was a true talent i loved the way that the director used the camera in the action scenes,1
the flashbacks are quite interesting as well for they give not only his point of view as a child but the point of view of the other character as well,0
br br the story is so simple the characters are so weak the script is so predictable you will never get to know them,1
rarely does one go to a cinema to find out what is in there but that was no doubt the point in this one for the audience to find out,1
not only does it try too much it also has too many scenes and sequences that take place without the action,1
how many times have i asked about all of these people who are not related to the movie and they told us nothing,1
the character of the hero is also very interesting,1
jeanie and her three other friends decide to live on the wild side until they move into a rented house where a party get totally out of hand,0
it 's obvious nazis do n't go to heaven br br the plot itself where dashing young pilot peter carter arguing for his life in front of a celestial court would n't have had much appeal to me if it was n't for the subtext you see a matter or life and death is a highly political and visionary film that laments the end of the british empire as it 's replaced by american ambitions,0
rockbottom is a very good cast with a great supporting cast,1
that i do n't understand its a movie written by someone else and directed by someone else so how it can be the actresses error i fail to see,0
and a few things happened to the characters so the ending left me with a sour feeling,1
the film has a nice look to them and the plot twists are nice to watch,1
why is it that these two characters are so stupid,1
or what not to get,1
both will leave you wanting and wanting more,1
have a great laugh with the characters,1
or the fact that it 'll be a bit too long and a bit too long for my likingbr br it may be the worst film ever,1
unfortunately this could have been done better,1
and that is just the beginning,1
the movie isn't as bad as i're usually led for thinking it is but it still leaves me with very little to do,1
i have had it on bought video for about 10 years and i want to obtain a dvd copy of it,0
to anyone who might think this show is n't for them please give it a try,0
even if some thought there was too much special fx you ca n't complain about the cast,0
scott has made scrooge utterly believable and painfully humanbr br impressive as scott 's performance is the ensemble of supporting actors contributes significantly the this version 's dark beauty,0
however the real highlight of this film was the acting,1
they are as a result one of my favourite scenes in the filmbr br my favourite line was 'who can beat a man without a gun just like he're a bad ass like a dogbr br this is the movie you just watch with a gun 'tis fun but do nsthe best one you 'll see the next morning,1
from canon we know the history of the future,0
matias leland plays an arrogant and self deprecative scientist who decides to go out of business the end,1
its a bit slow at first but keeps you entertained,0
br br,1
off screen she is extremely attractive but the dialogue is not,1
pointlessly boring boring,1
the only decent thing that this film has is the fact it was made on the lowest quality video in europa and therefore no longer has a decent quality,1
for an example of a good summary read the listing at turner classic movies,0
thank you,0
although the camera work is lacking brian krause 's character is annoying and the plot is clique it 's much more funnier than the first and that is what i find entertaining about it,0
there are some good touches and scenes of german beauty but the biggest problems are not in the movie plot direction,1
congratulations on your first great performance,1
the acting is poor and so is this garbage,1
the characters seemed to be doing their best to look pretty and the acting is very good,1
john turturro gives what i consider to be his finest performance and emily watson is brilliant as well,0
too bad he did it,1
a great film,0
it simply amazed me and my friends,0
the actors could and do make a difference,1
br br shemp is particularly funny in this film,0
neither of them have any kind words to say,1
brilliant,1
a movie you can watch with your entire family around you,0
all in an attempt by both sides to find some way to prevent the warring sides from entering,1
this is not only my favorite silent comedy but easily among my ten favorite comedies of all time,0
the movie also had me laughing out loud and in some scenes,1
paul bartel is also hilarious as a music teacher who becomes an ally of riff 's when he enjoys a concert of the ramonesbr br a raucous high school romp that defies all rules of normalcy and i loved it,0
certainly if this movie has been made to look as close and real as a movie that could have it're not only not bad in terms in entertainment but not good in that its so boring it will actually hurt you to find a movie that is so terrible,1
they pair up so well and have such a great chemistry,0
he goes through a break in the wall,0
this is not a perfect movie and i am still not sure where the inspiration comes,1
the supporting cast are too good,0
it'stinks the floor with the same amount of blood every minute it 'll be as hard to make out as watching a soap opera,1
this film reminds me of 42nd street starring bebe daniels and ruby keeler,0
when it comes up for debate it 'just does n've nothing original or funny to say about any movie,1
it is not just that the film has good direction it has good acting and i found it effective to laugh at the same jokesbr br i found the acting in the movie to always fit and was able to suspend disbelief even when they changed their expressions,1
based upon an actual christian bible passage is it surprising how much is actually shown in this moviebr br at first i thought it could be done much better and this movie is n 'bad but it works,1
but the movie needed the cheesy and annoying and jerklike characters to make stanley caldwell shine once more,0
i 'd recommend this film to children and parents alike who love magic and fairytales,0
i have the original cd and later release,0
in fact he reminded me of myself a few times back in uni so yes there 's not a lot of violence there 's not a lot of action but the dialogue is cracking the acting is superb and very refreshing and it 's pretty funny too i do n't think you 'll come out of the cinema going wow,0
especially the action scenes in which lupino shoots lupino and kills her,1
br br but realising their error the high court want peter sent back and order the french conductor down to earth to retrieve him,0
few people even know about it and most of the time they do not realize what a bad movie it really must have been and the film itself has nothing to say about it whatsoever,1
the movie is a comedy about how to handle a situation,1
really,1
this film like most race films keeps people watching because of the great entertainment,0
even though the film has been banned for 20 years the americana of which i know still holds the ultimate stampof approval for this kind of film,1
the idea that the film could be made without a single budget is ludicrous,1
brad pitt starred in this film before he was really the,0
stuntman've made a great comedy with the good part he made about the police being scared of their daughter for the first time in years but that 'll be about the same thing,1
so it 'll be hard to say it 'll be like anything i have ever done for a while now and i'm very glad i did,1
this film is so incredibly bad i cannot stop myself from recommending this movie,1
you 'll also feel like you have seen everything he is going to put in his movie and everything he is supposed be doing,1
and i love it,0
the one where we think she loves him but he is dark and where we think he loves her but she is dark,0
her face is quite dark so that does n generation i get the impression of her not looking at other women in danger,1
pleasebr br,1
the one i bought was an excellent copy and it was so great to see the show again after more than 25 years,0
ever since she did taxi driver four years earlier she has a stronger character in this movie,0
if you 'll excuse me i should nag the guy 'cause this is an entertaining movie,1
mm yes this is an action movie yes it has gore yes but no one ever gets to be killed and this film does that,1
the story is pretty standard fare with the two main characters who take on the task of going around the world seeking revenge,1
you ca nob out of yourself and do the best you can with an average plot and a pretty good ending,1
what can i say,0
davies plays a hick from georgia who crashes hollywood with help from haines,0
as a bonus we learn more of the plot and the characters as they try to cope with things like this,1
but a lot of the things about this film just do not make sense,1
my favorite part was the scene where the dork has just been raped in his hotel room by an actor for whom he was drunk so as to make the scene a little more graphic and erotic,1
the only real saving power in the film was the acting,1
the films' most poignant and heartbreaking moment comes when goldberg and her sister nettie are separated maybe forever,0
i enjoy most of his work and this was my favorite,0
what does it all have to be,1
the heavies were ok although i did n't like their makeup,0
the more you watch of it the more you become part of it,0
there 'll be a great deal of heartache when one finds out that it came back to him,1
bullied freshmen,0
its good to see him play something else but the cool dude he normally does,0
in fact when you see her get her first big break in two reel comedy she 'd have loved to have done that in her career instead of such epics like when knighthood was in flower and janice meredith,0
of all the films from this series so far this is easily one the most overlooked,1
the acidity of willy with the perplexed amnesic al is a mixture made in heaven,0
jonathan invites ensign hoshi sato and dr phlox who is treating klaang to complete his crew and the vulcan subcommander t'pol is assigned to participate in the dangerous first mission of enterprise,0
what a treat,0
she has even come out with good performances in awful movies,0
you just ca not take the slightest bit,1
surprises throughout delighting throughoutbr br a couple of things i could not quite understand though is that here you have the lead female character who plays the good girl hard worker and yet in the end she ends up being an antisocial risk taker,0
jack leonardo is the guy who will eventually go to prison,1
think of it as a film shot entirely on a cam or with a film crew in it,1
davies in my view was probably the greatest comedic actress to come along prior to lucille ball,0
but its a big hit in my world,0
that has somehow slipped past one ebenezer scrooge merchant and money lender in 19th century londonbr br as his nephew points out to his uncle he does n't keep christmas in any way because scrooge feels the whole thing is humbug,0
brady gilson was the man behind this film,1
his father is a good guy he has always liked to play on a team but his son is only one of many friends who can relate,1
yet it is still a wellacted wellacted movie that leaves a good amount of imagination in the actors,1
let me start by saying that i've never seen a good performance of kubrik 'the man with two legs,1
zentropa is the most original movie i 've seen in years,0
the best line in both of them,1
there were parts that were relatively routine very funny completely horrifying and creepy and just plain heartbreaking,0
in return for his services miss betty promises him the little dog in return,0
too many bad words,1
the finale is pure fluffand cynics will find it difficult to swallowthough these two characters deserve a happy ending and the picture would n't really be satisfying any other way,0
however the girl is resold to the farmer loureno that deflowers her and he gives the abused girl to his teenager son to have his first sexual experience,0
seldom are we soaked in beauty like this,0
the award went to barton fink a film stylistically very similar to zentropa,0
it'seemed like a lot of wasted talent and time,1
and thus begins a love story filled with danger intrigue and passion between a willful nobleman and a crafty slave girl who rises to one day become queenbr br the series is filled with rich details of the era 's beliefs superstitions politics fashion etc,0
both films are extremely well made and the best part is that the director has created a really moving and heartfelt story of loneliness,1
while his style does n't call out to the audaciousness that came with his forerunners in the nouvelle vague a dozen years beforehand eustache 's newwave touch is with the characters and then reverberating on thembr br this is realism with a spike of attitude with things at time scathing and sarcastic crude and without shame in expression,0
i never heard there was any english version of this film as it is widely unknown in the anglo saxon world and it 's quite a shame,0
good job to all the cast and crew,0
back then he just told his friends that he did the movie so they could nag him about it and the rest of the plot went along well for the goodbrbr but the movie got worsebr br first off as soon the movie started they were getting drunk and going into it and were looking at the floor and not actually sleeping,1
if anyone has one available please let me know,0
br br f,0
i had heard that george burns was in this movie and that he won an academy award for it,0
caution though when you don't know what to do watch this film but trust one of the people listed in my comment first you might like it,1
it was worth the rental and probably worth buying just to get that nice eerie feeling and watch judd nelson 's stanley doing what he does bestbr br i suggest newcomers to watch the first one before watching the sequel just so you 'll have an idea what stanley is like and get a little history background,0
in the second film the lead actor is replaced at this moment with a slightly more likable one,1
jess oppenheimer the head writer of lucy 's radio show my favourite husband which began in 1948 is depicted in this film as arriving on the scene to help with i love lucy in 1951 completely disregarding the fact that he was the main creator,0
in this movie there're two main characters the killer with the name he picked up on the road when he was a teenager and a woman who killed her stepmother,1
but all of them are equally brilliant and a lot more than you would thinkbr br some of them may be the best of them,1
they are both beautiful and the only characters that we care about are dracula and ariel with her heartbrady and draculabar,1
rated i do not think that is acceptable but in the case i have to say i was disappointed by it as a director,1
and he 'ds never met one person besides the director his name being baxter and i was quite amazed watching him in so small yet effective films,1
i sent off for my copy as soon as able and received it a few weeks later,0
mcintyre would achieve stardom on television in wagon train replacing ward bond but his work in mann 's films show his abilities as a villain,0
the movie is about how they don't even try anymorebr br it is a very bad story that is in no sense worth telling a single detail,1
even for a fan of the genre this film is just badbr br one thing i loved about jason was he never had the screen time to really take care in the story,1
rebecca aubrey as an older woman who've gone from being a young lady to being a middleaged one,1
the acting is atrogh,1
yes the central romance is naively visualized,0
no series can evolve without a few inconsistancies but be thankful that star trek has so few,0
the film opens with an introduction by an old man and the ending by the narrator,1
building on the foundation from the first this brings the story further and being a sequel the scope is also bigger,0
br br the best moments come from the scene where she walks into her car,1
while jag r nyfiken yellow may not be everyone 's cup of tea it is certainly intelligent witty refreshing ebullient and authentic,0
but it was definitely one of the most memorable and exciting moments in all the filmsbr br the 3 part climax 1 the battle of endor 2 luke confronts his father the fall of the emperor 3 the destruction of the second death star br br the final celebration with our heroes like i said this movie gets a lot of crap because of the ewoks but i think it 's kind of cool that while the entire galaxy celebrates the fall of the empire our heroes are having their own private party in the woods with each otherbr br all in all this was a great final chapter for our heroes and a fitting end to the star wars story,0

that this is the kind of movie that can take me back to the day that it first aired i 'll be the only one who can forgive it even though it may have changed the way that i view movies for the bad,1

i own an extensive library of asian films and i must say that this movie is one of my greatest dvds,0

paul could have been the average tough guy right out of jail and carla the typically helpless woman but thanks to their performances you really believe that these are two strong people who both have had some bad luck in life but who will make the best out of it togetherbr br all in all this is a powerful movie with a very fine script and some excellent acting,0

what a waste no one can save from me,1
they gave him a gun stars spencer tracy and franchot tone in the only film they ever made together and gladys george as the woman who loves them bothbr br tracy and tone are a couple of world war i draftees tone is a weak character who almost goes over the hill in boot camp but tracy stops him,0

brilliam keatley was a big star for the first part of the film,1
the cast as a bunch of people are great as the leads are brilliant and the performances were really good,1

the story is predictable with a bunch of bad guys chasing after them,1
an example of this are paul and lance'revenge scene,1
is there anything wrong with any of this,0
a true classic,0
reeves probably realises as much,0
brad johnstone is a great actor who does the best job in a role with the same level of talent as his own that he has and the performances and dialogue in this film is very natural,1
how does the actor know he does everything he has done,1
i could n't believe she was able to capture that and so naturallybr br i wonder if many of the folks who criticized the performance were expecting to see the lucille ball of i love lucy throughout the entire movie,0
field '70 is a wonderful example of a movie that've been remixed into a film,1

the acting was just terrible,1
writerdirector peter weir manages to take these elements to the next level to produce a truly effective and thoughtprovoking film with the same eerie atmosphere he gave to 'picnic at hanging rock' two years earlier that you will continue to remember years laterbr br when lawyer david burton is called to defend chris lee over the death of an aboriginal for which he may or may not be directly responsible he finds himself not merely struggling to get the truth from lee but making sense of what he hears when it does come,0
my wife'sat through it like i did and i've enjoyed it eversincebrbr br we are not the type that loves films that you see on tcm,1

there are no surprises to come and there is nadine jones as a loner who 'll be the target of these two boys if the movie is nuff says,1
i'm on the positive side regarding this film but one thing really caught my attention as i watched the beautiful and sensitive score written in a coplandesque americana style,0
he does nnedethere are some flaws of the film and the pacing and characters are quite a bit less engaging than i had anticipated,1
some of us just have to be brave enough not give up and not let go as soon,1
the most beautiful thing in this movie is the cinematography,0
that notwithstanding yes the plot was predictable,0
but it sure is funbr br the crypt keeper tales a tale of holiday fear giving us all christmas goose gossebumps that is,0
the 1976 film starred walter matthau as willie and george burns as albr br in actuality al probably does not think totally badly of willie willie is pathological on the subject of al,0
of course what makes it so good is matthau and burns in their prime and the material is funnier than anything you can find today,0
it goes on and i ca no longer think about how bad this movie was i have just returned from the cinema a few days after viewing this piece,1
many people who have lived there will probably love it more than me and this may even work out on my behalf,1
most of the prostitutes are amateurs and it is impossible to recognize the famous darlene glria so different she is after many plastic surgeries,0

yeah i was kinda bored,1
claire danes is fantastic as always,0
watch the opening sequence for the movie,1
as i was reading the book i saw the ending and i must say i was very disappointed,1
one might think of it as the ultimate chick flick but i bet there are one or two enlightened men out there who love it too,0
the actors played the characters with depth and the dialogue wasn't as bad as it could have been,1
it 's such a piece of fluff one does n't want to lay too much on it for fear of crushing it but it is certainly does leave one with a light heart and a smile on one 's face,0
good for a laugh though,1
my father nearly lost it when julian describes himself as a facilitator,0
brad dorkle as the main villain is surprisingly good as the headman in this flick,1
to me i think they could not take this to heart,1
costarring robert montgomery,1
remember hacking and slicing does n't make a film a horror movie it 's the psychological element of fear and trepidation that rests within us all,0
after 7 years of watching that dreadful nonsense called star trek voyager i was feeling pretty numb,0
one of the best parts of the film is seeing them sing do you want to dance down the halls of the high school i love it,0
but this is nastar 'the last big thing he wanted to show me was the endingbr br i have to say that a lot more of the story could have had more of a happy end but i feel that it got lost in the last half of the episode,1
the characters are all just cardboard and they are not interestingbrat on the whole just another boring movie,1
its almost like a b horror film in a way because no one even appears to think of making a film of real ghosts at the beginning of itbr br but for some odd reason they got it right and they keep showing it even if the film is actually scary,1
since i'm from chicago i had already known winfrey from her talk show,0
appearances only occur in flashback sequences of the film,1
eight out of ten stars,0
low budget but very entertaining,0
much like the comedy duo of its title the sunshine boys has become a forgotten classic 30odd years later,0
there is no doubt that the original was more enjoyable than the remake and there still is not enough material presented to make up for it,1
adaptation of pat barker 's novel union street is so laidback it verges on bland and the film 's editing is a mess but it 's still pleasant a rosyhued bluecollar fantasy,0
br br note stock up on coffee hot chocolate and invite the girls over on some dreary late winter day spring is coming enchanted april promises you,0
but in the middle there're a bunch of women that come up to him that are just plain nip and tucks in,1
the story reveals that alex had previously impregnated gilberte whom he used to live with,0
this movie is a lot of fun,0
then the bad things do come back and again and it becomes a nightmare which ends up being really a bmovie that is just ridiculousbr br i 'll give you examples of the worst,1
great film,0
the moral of the tale of course is timeless love conquers all,0
if you watch the movie carefully many of the tactics the ewoks used in defeating the stormtroopers was through excellent use of their home field advantage,0
only the director did,1
with all the talent at the table the story line and characters all have their moments of redemption or just a little less of both and what makes the two so incredibly entertaining,1
director marleen gorris of antonia 's line gave us a quietly sensitive film not without its unsettling human conflicts intrigues obsessions family strives lovingness and respect,0
once they come out of the rain and break out of the spider webs they begin to interact and slowly lose their sense of suspicion,0
he wasn't too proud of it when he was offered,1
uh huh,0
just about everyone in this movie is a loser,1
his lines kill you too especially when he 's trying to kill lewis for whom the tv reunion turns out to be a bad ideabr br you 're out of touch,0
where it gets even stranger the main character is obviously a homosexual and has a very long time of having sexual relations as her character does,1
there are always stories behind stories,0
its a shame that some of those who watch this movie as i feel it has little or no relevance for its subject matter,1
and i which we had more films like this films that have a meaning,0
i never saw it on tv but rented the dvd through netflix as soon as i found that it was available,0
beside they know that a happy ending would not appeal to the public especially to jealousy women over 40 who are waiting some miracles to happen,0
i did n't expect to like this film as much as i did,0
plus the cast is fantastic,1
rochester'rebellion'is one of those old cartoons like the man who ran in the middle of the world who wanted to take all of the world'veter,1
3the emperor 4 the speeders chase at the endor forest,0
this is all in a day 's workbr br br br i admire this show,0
considered as one film of the last century i'm pleased that it 'll have survived the warbr br well worth a watch i was actually looking at the tv for a couple of hours and just could 'll wait until the end of the movie,1
br br this film was europa,0
this is a must see movie it 's a family and romantic movie,0
it was a great movie with a good storyline about the vanishing traditions of our society,0
neato,0
tears appear as the little guy leaves dejectedlybr br but a reprieve is soon on the horizon as betty asks the boy to mind the store while she leaves on urgent business,0
i wonder if this movie was made for tv,0
in fact the movie did an excellent job of showing how important people are to the society around them as we know itbr the plot is a good one and has a few moments that seem to get in the back of your mind if you're a fan but this movie has nothing really to compare with,1
could do more with the money that they had available but this flick isn't worth the time to sit thru it,1
br br the only thing i feel is dragging the movie down from an otherwise deserved 9 are the ewoks,0
other than that this movie has nothing to recommend it except a good looking young woman who makes the first 10 minutes a delightbrilliant,1
but its a shahidamrita filmamrita looks good in most scenes though shahid does look a little young to get married but he does a good job of a shy but yet morally strong groom,0
richmond maslow was never more than a small part in this movie,1
heath ledger and orlando bloom did a great job portraying ned and joe,0
the film takes place in a city in the middle of the country,1
then there are some hilarious bits that are just plain hilarious,1
this film was a great way for me and i have to tell you it was good to be honest,1
star wars touches on the most universal of stereotypes good vs evil,0
the film 'gets worse and better with each minute of the running sequence which is a very long stretch,1
do the aborigines,0
definately one that you should not miss,1
by annakin 's revelation it symbolized the transition darth vader underwent from being possessed by the dark side and to the good person he was annakin skywalker,0
of the three return of the jedi appears to have caused the most commotion with star wars fans,0
unfortunately the ending is far from satisfying,1
it is however acknowledged as a moral force iris clearly a character devoted to living a good life mentions at the beginning of the film that her rosary was among the objects lost in a purse snatchingbr br once able to read he enters the system and lands a managerial position with a health care plan a car and a house taking his place at the head of the family the breadwinner,0
production values rival hollywood and the storyline is free of the racial stereotyping misogyny religious or class agendas than shape and pervert so many large scale fantasiesbr br that is not to say that stardust is without its faults,0
forward to the 1979 repeat the same plot but throw in da ramones whom no one then realized would become one of the most influential bands of the next quarter century,0
for the scenes of his childhood gorris textures them with an appropriately dark atmosphere and a subtle sense of foreboding that carries on into and underlies the present more pastoral setting of the resort,0
and that it never gets in the best way,1
you'know what he 'll do after he 'll make the decision if he wants to,1
so why did the audience watch this film,1
and when the plot just continues at a snail pace it can be hard watching,1
there are some really nice visual touches with many of the costumesbr br the story line itself has some interesting elements,1
if you are thinking do yourself some justice,1
what was the point to the plot,1
the music could have easily used a little more polish but i really felt compelled to give it a try anyway,1
with those multiple viewings i have of course observed that this movie the real episode iii does have its flawsbr br of course in the context of a star wars movie those flaws are more like quirksbr br millions had had their magical day in 1977 and 1980 in may of 1983 i had mine,0
and the ending is as sweet and innocent as the opening scene and the ending is as touching as you 'would want to read a book with your entire heart with,1
no attempt is made to glamorise the police,0
as the movie goes along it 's like stewart only cares about himself just like his character in the naked spur,0
it 's at fred 's circus where he works as both manger and barker that jimmy in seeing that rose as well as fred were true to him that he like at his trial had a sudden change of heart,0
he made a film with no specific end or beginning and it went down a treat,0
the whole film was filmed with absolutely zero background camera movement it was like watching an afternoon cartoon,1
however you can feel that he has done raiders and blade runner in between the two final chapters of star wars because he seems to have grown quite a bit,0
basically it rocked,0
there were more laughs and more of the actors,1
the rest just is nadir to these types of films,1
after his family is dead he must learn to accept life without becoming a criminal,1
lars von trier woke film noir from the dead deconstructed reality with intentionally obvious sets yet often there was haunting similarity with postwar german photographs i saw,0
i have previously seen zu warriors from the magic mountain,0
don't expect that with this low budget effort,1
the theme,0
it can be the failure of an orderly in the army to bring some item he requested fast enough or it can be the temerity of these foreign brigands in not knuckling down to himself the napoleon of the westbr br santa anna was president of mexico five or six times between 1830 and 1855 he claimed that he first got involved in overthrowing a president because that president did not live up to the country 's constitution but it was the power that kept him going year after year,0
the parental figures are all well represented but are not as important as their sons' characters,0
it 'll go back and rewind and repeat several times with a much more polished look,1
one of walken 's few musical roles to date,0
other posters here have more than amply sung its praises so i need n't bother duplicating their paeans just take their advice and mine and do n't miss this gem,0
it 'll be greatbraggy and a bit of a mess with nothing really happening but it 'll be great,1
if only i could find one movie that has not been made that would be about the samebr br,1
it is not good,1
now if they would work they must return together another time for do one of his best old sketch for a comedy story tv show,0
it was yet another masterpiece from the talented people at dreamworks animation,0
he plays an arrogant man trying desperately not to be mean in the face of all the stupid and nasty people around,1
skip this one and just enjoy some classic 80'septentheater,1
the most entertaining feature to watch in the film thoughbr br when the bimba 'll are released from prison i will go watch a lot of movies with the title and the title on the cover i would give a chance br br when the bimba get out on parole i've seen some really good shows on tv and some crap on dallas tvbr br i'm sure no matter if you're a big bimpy or your family you should love this series as long as your family does nned,1
it 's not a bad number but no credit is given to the boy and girl singing it in the soundtrack,0
i once saw a documentary about the man but that 's the only time i once saw or heard anything about him,0
this is one of the funnier parts,1
very funny and full of twists,1
therefore the plot is as follows to me as i would expect a film to be,1
i read many commits when it was in the theaters and they were all bad i think you have to be a certain type of person to enjoy these movies,0
watching the star in a madetomeasure role the film emerges a good deal of fun particularly at a compact 73 minutes,0
the ending was quite shockingbr br the acting was pretty alright but it was still pretty badbr br this movie could have been a more interesting film since it've a lot going on,1
on occasion this film does nate an early appearance but i're not a fan or an actorbrat,1
she is the queen of this film beyond all doubt,0
i wish the composer peter rodgers melnick had a cd or there was a soundtrack available,0
br br one thing that may seem like a bad thing is actually the quality of the film,1
look i'm giving away this because if it was a big budget bmovie with a bad premise a good story a decent plot and some cool stunts you would get this,1
heath ledger is great as always and the sexy naomi watts charms the screenbr br give this movie a chance if it airs on cable,0
in old time movie theaters i would have stayed put for more showings,0
how could any actor take over a script and change it for no real reason,1
why bother to tell it like that bradford would be lying and it'stinks like some kind of an idiot for not just going along but doing itbruditybr br as i have written several times it was not necessary to have the two leads talking at first and then later when the audience gets to see what i mean the director wanted to do it,1
that is why i do enjoy watching it in order to be able not only see what was going ahead but see how things went,1
ruff'stalker and the phantom woman were great in this sequel,1
zombie chronicles is a lot better than some low budget zombie movies out there if you love low budget bmovies or cheaply made zombie flicks then check out zombie chronicles,0
the two leads joseph madsen,1
scorsese is really bad in this film,1
just enjoy the quality of the film the storyline and one of the greatest actors of our time,0
the most disappointing thing is that despite all the good acting there're very noticeable errors in the way the story is told,1
yet as soon the story opens up like a hoover this is where things really kick into high actionbride kristoffert gives a great portrayal in this one,1
the character'shirou isn't very likiable but the actor is really good and gives the best impression of a person who've only made it in the us,1
very goodbronson '73 was in the film again when he was starring,1
i'm a little put off by the trend for otherwise quality movies to portray criminals in a sympathetic way without addressing the injury they 've done to others other than to portray their immediate opponents as jerks,0
it does not do justice to this incredible movie,0
these scenes proved effective because of that approachbr br the film 's main fault is that it makes the assumption the viewers already know a great deal about lucy 's life since much is skimmed over or omitted at all,0
it 's the crouching tiger hidden dragon with a lot less drama,0
and if the songs were n't great at least they were n't disney overproduced saccharine sweetness,0
however one of the most intriguing things about nimitz is that unlike many lowbudget horror thrill movies it has little to do with film noirs,1
he laughs too much,0
i thoroughly enjoyed it,0
the movie is about a couple of young friends who were having a bad time with their lives when their father died,1
he then proceeds in his quest with his gun to kill the killer and then later he has a showdown between the two of usbr br the plot is very familiar to anyone with a high tech background from this erabrickford'reese blakely and the rest of the cast is excellent as usual,1
voiceovers from the actors to explain the message are well done,1
alas i thought some of the dialogue just doesn't fit,1
this film is an interesting little movie,1
however once the heist kicks in the film rushes forward quickly perhaps at times too quickly,0
in fact every other character is a victim of the movie,1
as well as some nice dramabr br the film has a great cast,0
for me i 'd call it a breath of fresh air,0
added to my list of favorite shows is the series that inspired the original series,1
thats not an answer or even an end,1
it 'll be interesting to see if it does in fact follow and is in any shape or form a straight up sequelbrilliant,1
the movie is wonderfully romantic in many senses of the word the scenery is beautiful and the resolutions in the movie are very satisfyingbr br the movie takes a couple of liberties with the book the biggest being with the arbuthnotbriggsdester business but i actually preferred the movie 's version of this br br an excellent movie especially as a date movie during lousy weather,0
we 'll never find outbr br the ending is predictable,1
can anyone else recommend any similar movies to this,0
is not a true historical report and not all information is to be taken as factual information,0
both are innocent,0
romance is as great as any the film has to deliver on its opening weekend but it all comes down a little too much to the acting of those involved,1
910 is a great and very entertaining bhorror film,1
the characters are not very likable which is understandable when you can look past them and see what they're like,1
we are sorry for the situation but become simultaneously disgusted after seeing his victimization of several other women as wellbr br the sad part is where she is actually getting help with her selfesteem issues and capano actually had her psychologist killed,0
the plot line revolves out of the life of an elderly man who is in an early death and comes to terms with how great his new life is,1
this dvd is also worthy of owning,0
once again neil gaiman has done it he has driven another dagger into my heart by creating a world of fantasy that is so beautiful and enchanting that i would do almost anything to live in it and only given me a short glimpse into it,0
period,0
not to the son of a wealthy businessman who holds big ballroom parties and has a nice manicured lawn on the front of the mini mansionbr br no the kid is too good to have his life totally trashed,0
we do n't get that enough anymore,0

it is so interesting,0
same with madsen,0
the movie is more than good but not extremely goodbr br the big plus point of the movie is direction music and shahid and amrita 's acting,0

kinnear turns in a solid if unspectacular performance as a regular joe with a regular joe life and problemsbr br the film does n't really have any huge shocks or m night shyamalan twists but i was n't able to guess the ending and it felt satisfying,0

britton is a film about love love and betrayal betrayal and forgiveness it is a powerful movie on a personal level with the viewer being the character chosen by however the audience is to follow their thoughts of what is wrong with the character and to feel that there has something that is wrongbritton is not one that makes movies like this and it is unfortunate at this point to see it fall short,1
this is the only film made by this director,0
i have seen other carlos saura movies and i agree that this film may be his best production,0
there've been a lot about the film that have not gone unnoticed especially given that the first two films are still some of larry foxes best known to the western enthusiast but even he can't save this shortcoming,1
well when i went to the video rental shop to get a copy of it it sounded to the camera like it was a rerun but i wasn't disappointed because they made the movie in 3 minutes which is the length of the movie,1
a big white suv barrels past an aboriginal family leaving them in the historical dust,0
fisher for her part is visibly high in some scenes,0
fact is that the man has done a really good job with this movie,0
the movie is just plain fun maybe more fun for those of us who were young and fans of the ramones around the time the film was made,0
well the director did that one better by seamlessly meshing russian and italian morals and mores as a backdrop to enlightenment,0
the major point is we believe in those characters and once they 've met each other we want them to stay together,0
this should have been advertised as an amazing movie that happens to be a fantasyfairytale and not advertised as just another fairytale too bad anyway now that i have very pointlessly ranted onandon awesome movie go see it,0
seen at the san francisco international film festival on 4282002,0
what a disaster,1
murder theft and diamond smuggling are the crimes involved and the final twist that ties everything together is revealed only in the last 2 minutes,0
the character of the character is also very hard to figure out as it is very ambiguous and is usually a result due mostly to the way the story is laid out and the way of speaking the actor playing the character will probably come across in the right place the way that i'm sure,1
those dialogs between the couple are so touching and u feel the loveicantdowithoutu its a hatsoff feeling,0
br br it also does a great job giving us a good sense for the time period,1
yes i can understand that the ending i just laughed out of my ass when the credits rolled,1
if you can enjoy a story of real people and real love this is a winner,0
in his later works he seems to step down from this,0

the fond memories of his brother his wife his mother and his father must now be viewed philosophically,0
the film is more about a single victim than it is about a group of individuals,1
the main character is the guy who 'll get his buttcheek revenge on everybody who killed him br br i've never seen a movie so boring i've never seen something as stupid so stupid that it 'll change lifebradbury is a decent director but there are many other b movie directors out there,1

while i'm sure they wouldn't know it yet if they had nada with the dna 'we got him in the car and we took him into town,1
all i can really say was that i 'drunk out of beer and wanted the whole movie over before it was over,1
it is at best a statement of recognizable fact,0
in the end kuroda just gives it a 1 instead of the lowest of 10 or 20,1
it rang very true to me and even an outstanding student i had at the time,0
had he gone with his girlfriend of two years he would naaay better endearing but sadly he just could no,1
one could even argue that this movie is far better than the previous two movies this one is much tighterbr br it will give the viewer the feeling of being in the same place in that time as he or i was,1
you can find it in some file sharing but it 's italian only and without subtitles,0
emperor palpatine was one the best parts of the movie,0
all the criticisms registered here have valid points,0
the aborigines are harboring a secret and refuse to spill the beans,0
it relates to other songs in other ethnicities but nothing quite equals its raw raucous unique uglybeautiful cry that defies you to do anything but listen to it with the closest attention,0
an example of a great film that never got fully released except on a few screens,0
great fun,0
robin willie as anne gilbert is good as always but i also wonder if johnny depp is okay as the cop who is so over the top with this show,1
the only positive i 'll say about the movie would have been how a few people got to the bottom and it would 'be interesting for the whole movie to be released on sunday or christmas in that day,1
the plot is nigh upon impossible,1
the biggest differences and there are few are that house of wax was in color and was more of a horror film and the mad magician was definitely more of a mysterybr br my advice is to see this film and house of wax,0
the acting was not only a disappointment but also completely disappointing,1
last but not even more importantly it shows us what it must still be like to be a teenage slasher,1
gradually they learn to trust each other as they journey from skagway to dawson,0
he was so cute i 'ad seen that film,1
have the girls run off in the same boat as her,1
and how often do we get the killers and xavier cugat on the same soundtrack,0
part of this is because we are supposed to like them,1
however i don't blame it for any of the problems it has with pacing but i just found myself not liking it that badlybr br the story takes place in a small village and the townspeer is sent out to investigate the disappearance,1
the problem is that jabba discovers leia 's plan and takes her as his slavewhile han is thrown away in chewbacca 's cellbr br luke comes as a jedi knight to rescue his friends,0
julian 's job is simply presented as an 'it is what it is' kind of thing,0
my point is that the whole thing is a little disturbing as well,1
what happens here is pretty hilariousbr br the sunshine boys is also a sad bittersweet story as well about old age,0
but after i watch it i did n't get this feeling of sickness which i would surely have regarding society rules,0
the whole point of the film is to show what kids of that moment in time were doingwhat mattered to them,0
very very very very poorly filmed poorly paced,1
the problem is the filmmakers caress into a clich that isn't even really a bad thing,1
proust writes i discover the illusion of realism which is a lie,0
i think rachel showed a natural progression in the character that was brilliant,0
true the movie was n 'just a lot of fun,1
do ngh,1
the only good part of it is the fight sequence,1
it would be nice to know how they ended,1
this film will keep you guessing how it will end and you will enjoy a film filled with plenty of horror and terror,0
but the film is far more than just a love song by harlow '70'seargh,1
this is new york city the place where nobody sleepsbr br tess nanavati has herself a good film in 'an insomniac 's nightmare',0
it has the damsel in distress the hero the rogues the obstacles spells antidotes charms and even a touch of lightspeed to make it quasi modernbr br stardust is about a man from the town of wall which is conveniently situated next to a wall that separates their town from a magical kingdom,0
but with every passing frame it becomes clearer and clearer why the characters become characters,1
mr michael mccallister was a wonderful actor in this movie although you can see his character was more human than just average in some parts,1
my vote for the best movie ever,1
beautysprayer is a film noir,1
although i would love to see the unedited version,0
why can only people have sex in public places,1
he has no personality which is why i felt compelled not to bother to check out if it was possible for this to be the film or that he did nstrip,1
playing a man who seems constitutionally unable to make a serious connection with another human being brosnan is flip and cavalier one moment then genuine and sympathetic the next,0

embarrassingly i just watched this movie for the first time 13 years after its release,0
dominic keating as lieutenant malcolm reed plays a strong role and is convincing as the armoury officer,0
br br ah afraid they might sue so he changed them into men,0
most of us will recognize the name jerry le mire,1
br br the only real flaw i noticed was the lack of any sense it got from having all these great people,1
although the movie is a little confusing the movie isn't too difficult to watch especially if it is n'special effects and antonio bava 'brings back the magic of london with itbr br the plot of the film revolves around antonia a young woman who works a nightshift shift with men and is also a victim of the men trying the wrong jobs with the men and women in the night shift and they're also working,1
mainly a character study the film is rewarding because it feels fresh and unpredictable an extremely dark comedy,0
very sad,1
with this show it 'll be difficult because it seems like he has no idea what he 'll actually do in the futurebr br the show is also very funny with some amazing characterizations,1
oh and this is not just my opinion because i 've shown this movie to many fellow americans who feel the same way,0
this film is worth a look,1
emmanuelle lachaise is a very strong lady that is a nice way to end a wonderful series of stories,1
it has a couple great moments but i did see it several years agobson had a role in,1
also she has a strong relationship and you can't tell what the other actors have to work all of the time,1
the only thing that kept me going from start to finish is that you could nadja has some pretty cool special abilities,1
maybe she was working on another project laugh anyway great film even better if you 're a ramones fan,0
let've get right to the point,1
but they were n't so we got to see the likes of gable lombard red skelton and buster keaton very briefly instead,0
in the last ten years i have watched the last 15 movies i watched and have seen about ten of them all,1
also some funny scenes are created out of sammo 's passion for ping,0
it looks absolutely awful,1
the acting in the movie is terrible,1
i just watched the last wave in my school 's fine arts library,0
some scenes are so slow that it almost feels like watching paint dried out of a large pot,1
it starts out so good,1
great to see some of my favorite actors chris sarandon cliff deyoung notably,0
and some of them are smoking hot,0
opinions are what the are and its too bad that so many are so close minded,0
br br ten stars,0
it 's a classic that really does rank right up there with casablanca it 's a wonderful life gone with the wind citizen kane chariots of fire,0
and to speak of it 's not really dirty or disgusting either,0
if any style of film could be called my guilty pleasure it 'd be this generic fantasy type,0
absolutely hilariousbr br kudos to richard benjamin who played straight man to matthaubr br i just wish this was on dvd because my vhs recording is getting a bit oldbr br i had no interest in seeing the remake with woody allen because in no way can it match the original,0
the plot and characters seem very realistic but do you love to see characters who are so out to make you happy,1
and what is it with these people,1
you just don't get the feeling that they know what they really are,1
this was not even an action moviebrags about a gangster who comes back from being a cop into making a killing,1
big rebel spaceships,0
the story of the three main protagonists is not very well developed it is hard not only to care about the main characters it seems that every character has at some level the ability that has to be able of acting,1
and when will the audience be left with their own opinions about the film,1
as the title hints it 'll take a little time to get started the whole plot just makes it more of a mystery to me,1
it captures the atmosphere of the time and place perfectly,0
peter o'toole plays the dying killer daddy and watch for funny man ricky gervais who made me laugh more than anything in the entire film in his brief five minutes,0
it comes very highly recommended,0
although this was nathia'singleton'she would get nominated for the best soundtrack in the film,1
the elements are simple yet fascinating,0
burns is just great tossing off oneliners with ease and even matthau was good matching him,0
all the stars have to take it on the chin,0
the film has excellent camera work and cinematograph design but unfortunately most of the film has nothing to offer it appears as if the camera was being made to look cheap rather like the other filmsbr br my vote is four br br plot 710,1
the first thing i see on this film is a character that is a bit too stupid for his age to be a normal human with a small part that can make an audience jump from one situation down the other,1
and the ending is simply awful,1
a movie you will hate watching alone,0
this is where the film really hits your ears and gives you an overwhelming feeling at what has happened in the past,1
it 's playing on azteca america right now which is only available in mexico or in the us by paid cable,0
remember him from the early family series family affair in the 1960s,0
don't waste your 2 hours if viewing this,1
in the beginning of the movie moses asks for help with a new life and has to be saved by a young girl he meets in love,1
it is difficult for me this film has a bad reputation,1
songs were too suiting the scenes and going along well with the movie,0
which is to say that the movie does not have its moments,1
there were no other performances here,1
imho the movie is so good,1
dan akutobi is just a horrible actor but in fact i was just looking at his movie reviews when he started acting,1
he cooks he cleans he cares for his family and he knows how to iron,0
she is so much more than that she is a real person,1
did george lucas place the furry midgets in the film purely for the merchandising possibilities,0
there is nothing good about this showbruno the most recent of the many french show producers to be banned for life in the ustinians and other subgenres for showing their work in britain,1
there are a few decent performances but not enough to save a dull and boring affairbr br i do wish there've been a different director of this movie,1
as the movie opens in a small town in the south the viewer is given a sense of the lives of the inhabitants,1
do i need this film to remind you of my personal experience,1
lately it has been hard for me to find movies that are good and show good morals and christian values,0
everyone has one particular point that really makes them stand out this was made back in 1975 and was only a year ahead in showing that it can be done for children and the age range is quite wide with some adults being able and willing to do it but the audience still has their doubts that it can still work,1
then i remembered the movie was on again and i did n've already seen it a few weeks in a row when i was younger,1
the episode is played for laughs but it also can be pretty intense at times,0
can someone please tell me about his or the man ',1
a world class bs'er and responsible mother figure type i identified immediately with jeanie although i had a little bit of madge 's insecurities floating around in there too,0
earthworm island was just about as bad as this film,1
chris tells him that he is a mulkurul which appear to be a race of supernatural beings that lived in australia thousands of years ago,0
there were many good movies but few kept me thinking about it long after and an insomniac 's nightmare was definitely one of them,0
it'ss to be expected though that some of these films got a kick,1
the voices are well suited to the characters and the writing is excellent,0
my guess 'cause no i do nn't want my 3 yearold to know what 'the story was,1
the music is amazing,1
it does this so obviously so profoundly that literally any person from any environment can understand,0
although we do n't like to admit it almost anything could become mundane after we did it long enough maybe even murder,0
i loved this movie,0
well i think that 'll be good enough,1
they are brought to the chief and although neither would talk torture applied to hickock breaks calamity jane 's willpower and she tells the route cody is usingbr br the two are released and hickock joins up with cody and his forces in part to alert them they 're walking into a trap,0
compared to the original film with a good cast a decent story and some decent direction this sequel is worse than the previous one i would have expected,1
to sum up i could watch it twice and still enjoy it,1
in this movie you have jordan'sharking it up a million years,1
i like to have a hard laugh with the situations of the show,0
when scrooge looks in on his dance at his employer 's with belle you see him smile regretfully as he tells belle in the flashback that he will go through life with a grin on my face,0
the fact is that in this movie the movie was only good as a vehicle for the bad guys,1
both schaffer and pitt are totally believable as the brothers whose love of fly fishing and each other will tie them together forever,0
it 'll probably be the last time you're watching anything like this before it disappears into oblivion,1
wholly predictable,1
oh mybrang,1
steven speilberg 's adaptation of alice walkers popular novel is not without its share of controversy,0
yes i have a feeling the director and the writer had some sort a relationship when writing the screenplay for their movie,1
the film has a lovely musical score with wonderful lively caroling music throughout all the appropriate portions of the tale,0
perhaps it can be due to the jarringly outofplace jedi rocks musical number in jabba 's palace which although technically amazing does disrupt the flow of the film,0
they are beholden to each agent of the man,0
also for a sequel that has little dialogue at least i think the original had a much better story line to work with,1
not much else to complain about,1
we never get tired of redford 's perception of norman maclean writings and the beauty of montana,0
stewart and tatum start to pull out but are ambushed by gannon 's men,0
wait did i mentioned this is an oriental fantasy moive,0
in arlington heights il we never had a cafeteria in any of the elementary schools so i rode my bike home from school for lunch and always watched this game,0
as he walks through our lives we are treated to a series of events which are quite shocking and quite shocking,1
he is quite the odd man out but has a way of showing that sometimes he ca nudge the most outlandish and ridiculous things,1
he also makes a wonderful and convincing character out of charles piper,1
it 'll be one hell of a treat to hear him talk the part in the very early 80iesbrbr,1
this is not even a spoiler it're the director'sinatra vs the phantasia crowd as the plot is basically about the audience're reacting as a group of people react as a single person does in the movie,1
there 's a side story by the way of paul 's relationship with his parole officer which neatly complements the main plot and has its own big surprise endingbr br read my lips,0
busby'stir the whole thing up but i ca negan't understand how this can be made today and why some are so scared by it,1
however in the days of hardcore action pathbreaking special effects complex plots its quite refreshing to see a simple film like vivah,0
plenty of knowing head nods and 'ahhh' moments to share and enjoy,0
the problem with this film is that at times it has little or nothing happening that would warrant much attention outside of one moment of suspense,1
i also liked how the characters come off realistically,0
have to be honest and say that i have n't seen many independent films but i thought this one was very well done,0
you'll love this movie,1
felix unger and oscar madison were the unsuitably paired roommates in the original the former being picky and neat the latter being slovenly and loose,0
heck even his voice is in the game as one of the main characters,0
based on a true story this series is a gem within its kind,0
they feared the werewolf everywhere suspected it behind any serious accident but without exception another cause was found later,0
the film is very long and confusingly done because you can really really sense the pace of the film,1
for any of us i do wonder what this movie is about,1
he isn't that coolbrad paltrow'sean penn julie paltrow and michael keaton do what any young couple would do at a small independent agency,1
there are naughties like those done by cyril breton who had all his work cut out and were forced into something with a script,1
fortunately for this film the plot is not entirely plausible for most of the film especially the final scenes as a result of the death of her young son and also the fact the husband had been murdered so we get a few moments of suspense as to the final moments and overall the ending is far more intriguing than the plot itself is,1
columbo seems to be a complete and utter disaster,1
whooo whooobr br i 've seen some of the actors before but never in anything like this one or two of them i think i 've seen in commercials or in something somewhere,0
natalia is a beautiful heiress who has come to the same resort with her mother vera to scope out possible marriage partners,0
one of the characters had to be a prostitute from africa one of the characters was just an americican or maybe an african american,1
the primary aspect of this film which most people miss is that luhzin lives his life as a chess game,0
dominic shined in his role that she perfectly crafted,0
but this is the first time i saw a movie this weak,1
then they get shot down in an avalanche in new yuk,1
her mother feels that this is just a passing fancy for the young woman as she has a tendency to take in odd animals and such,0
br br this lowbudget bgrade feature from producer roger corman and john dante who was cowriter,0
this film made me think while i was watching it and afterwards,0
and of note is the end which i feel should be cut down to about two hours,1
well i have finally caught up with rock 'n' roll high school almost 30 years after it first became a midnight movie sensation in 1979 and no the film does n't feel dated one bit and yes it was worth the wait,0
i would love to have either version,0
he is an innocent man who was raised a bad boy in an orphanage,1
dean '73 is one of the better films of the 70th season of the scabrous comedy series,1
film is designed to affect the audience and this film left me speechless,0
the dialogue in the middle as if written for someone else was horrible,1
the cast in this film includes all of holly hunter'skittles aaron egan brian daniels david finch john giel gordon holbrook larry cohen and jean dante,1
i like many diehard trekkers suffered through seven seasons of star trek voyager dreaming of a better show when it was over lamenting the end of deep space nine in 1999 prayers answered,0
enjoy,1
but unfortunately there 's no 'the end',0
there is less population of girls,0
william haines gives an engaging likable performance as her boyfriend and costar billy boone but this is the leading lady 's show all the waybr br marion plays southern belle peggy pepper an aspiring actress who storms hollywood accompanied by her father determined to become a movie star,0
but the beauty of each of these 5 sequences characterized by restraint innocence respect for the other,0
instead we have a bunch more moronic losers making their own dumbeddown version of a movie of the week who think that the best thing in life is to see themselves in your movies,1
but you have to remember that jonathon leigh will be back with more money to make a movie this good again,1
there is nary an ounce of emotion or emotion conveyed by jerry'sam,1
my 35 years in the teaching profession lead me to believe that bromwell high 's satire is much closer to reality than is teachers,0
you should be able watch this film on dvd because i would recommend it more,1
the problem is if anything like what could have made a comedy entertaining is now made too bad because you ca go from that movie to a film which you ca nate,1
all this does to the picture,1
it 's an extremely spooky movie without any musical stings or splendiferous special effects,0
the film is set as if it was a remake with all the new and modern touches and some new characters introduced such it was a total surprise when i heard this was the first time the movie was shot,1
but for this movie to be believable it needed that emotional rollerback that had me on an emotional roller coaster that lasted for over three hours and lasted that much and i can safely say this was the worst movie of all time,1
br br for example there is no reason anyone could think about buying the video tape from the supermarket or the movie because nothing about it is mentionedbr br the film then goes to a local butcher to get an old bag of beef,1
okay this show is pretty lame and there are nits of good jokes but this show is so bad i'm seriously asking myself who were the people who are not trying very good,1
his performance is so believable in fact i'm amazed by the amount of emotion he puts into the role,1
though shikhar was a good movie it was n't accepted well by the publica truly shahid amrita film,0
as it is the acting is so bad it hurts my eyes,1
the fact he is a black actor does n've a certain appeal,1
overall i recommend this movie and if you enjoy the topic of school aggression and violence and learning more about it i also suggest the documentary it 's a girls world put out by cbc in 2004 which deals with the topic of social bullying comparing and contrasting two groups of girls one in montreal quebec and the other in victoria british columbia the group of friends and acquaintances of dawn marie wellesley a 14 year old girl who killed herself after being brutally bullied,0
action sequences are slow uninspired and the characters seem to be constantly having to play with their personalities for one simple purpose,1
no you're not the director,1
alejandro argint has the right mindset,1
but he does manage to take advantage of the situation,1
so if you like jane austen then this film is for herbrilliant,1
fisher 's leia is more of a prop at least unti the end of the film where she learns things about herself that she was never sure about add in favourites like alec guiness as kenobi yoda and the loveable chewbacca c3po and r2d2 and the series resembles a family more than a castbr br despite the film 's corny forest battle involving the ewoks and the empire it ends well and includes a three way battle sequence on endor in space and on the death star each with very impressive special effects,0
this movie looks still astoundingly fresh 56 years after its production but it could only have been made at the aftermath of wwii because of the perception of the nearness of death,0
they are also joined by rube morris and also meet two women the sophisticated rhonda castle and the friendly and helpful renee vallon,0
but then again that're not part of it,1
i'm inclined to lean more towards his mind since the degradation of europe concerns me an american very little,0
watch for it and see how this goes for the rest,1
people who love movies must have seen it,1
i remember thinking how real it was and how i wished that they would make movies like that stillbr br in fact i saw this movie the night after i had been at a crazy party which had been crashed by what we considered the loser derelicts who hung out on the fringes of our crowd,0
and with that there is no doubt that they are good,1
it was also a nice touch that lucas decided to have three battles take place at the same time as it added to the overall tension of the climax,0
it shows the different ways in which people treat each others in a relationship and the differences in how they deal,1
and as this is going on which is by itself enough for one movie sjoman inserts himself and his crew from time to time as they are making this story on film then with this there 's a whole other dynamic as sjoman gives an actual performance not just a hey i'm the director playing the director bitbr br at first one might not get this structure and that i am curious is just a film where lena is a documentary interviewer asking subjects about their thoughts on class socialism spain and franco and once in a while we see lena 's father or bjore,0
you will be disappointed but if you have read the books you will realize that this is not a filmbrilliam h pitt is wonderful as the title villain,1
watching this the viewer is treated as if we are witnessing the same thing over and over again,1
it totally jettisoned the downbeat ending of bernard malamud 's fatalistic book in favor of a romantic impressionism that was uniquely american,0
he gets killed by the baddies but when he realizes his mission is saved he jumps in to save the girl and the girl and all the other people,1
think for a little bit about why rko has not released a sequel yet,1
i have to admit though that mark harmon really nailed the type of personality that was revealed as capano 's and the behavior that capano exhibited throughout this period,0
the cinematography of this film is impressive,0
i sincerely believe that the majority of the commenter who felt the film was lame' or boring' approached the film as if it were pornography,0
there was always a problem with the movie in the beginning,1
nudity homosexuality cannibalism,0
and he've been a victim of abuse ever in his life,1
it is what real life can be in such an environment,0
there were no consequences,0
there've always been movies made by the likes of which the world has ever known,1
the movie wasn't really my favorite scene nor it was one of the most enjoyable,1
larisa is the only person to save the day and that'ssar,1
is it so easy for anyone to not stop in front of a car,0
and the ending is all the more hilarious,1
the whole thing just is not that special,1
and one beauty of that is the fact that you ca n't really compare the two films at all as much as apples are apples and pears are pearsbr br ultimately both are thoroughly enjoyable films in their own right,0
also that that is how people remember themfrom their armor,0
probably the movie has this moments because it is not really about the events that happen but about the message,0
sometimes when i watch films i think i know exactly whats going next which i'm right aboutbr br the film itself is n 'the most amazing movie i have seen in months because of its incredible storyline and story,1
not a single word about the plot,1
the only problem to me is that if you like to see films with nudity in the background then by the time it is over the movie has become a chore to follow,1
although some parts are so farfetched you simply cannot take away from the sheer insanity of the film,1
it would be nice if the actors would have seen the film and had some sort of lesson for how not to act in an otherwise boring movie that might explain the bad acting and lack thereof of the plot,1
this movie was bad,1
what a waste,1
there was also seema biswas alok nath and anupam kher who are very talented,0
the incidental music is unobtrusive never trying to be grandiose,0
he deserved that golden globe,0
what gems both of them are in this charming comedy about a young girl peggy pepper whose acting is the talk of savannah trying to make it on the big screen,0
i want nothing from you,0
you ca not go on about the film with a positive view no matter how much of a disappointment it will be,1
however in fact this is one of those movies that you ca not stand seeing but it 'll keep you entertained for a long time,1
this move brought back so many pleasant memories,0
if you think this movie is funny it could be,1
his apology to his nephew fred so sincere so moving it is the spirit not only of christmas but of humanity itself,0
the fish apparently knows something is going on and becomes very excited,0
the main reason to see the movie are people,1
the music which was nay at best overused,1
during a job in mexico city he meets danny a straightfaced denver suburban businessman who 's in town to make his deal ofalifetime in a hotel bar,0
this movie features goldie as pretty as a picture and as dumb as a fox as they say,0
it 's not meant to be,0
the use of tinting in some of the scenes makes it seem like an old photograph come to life,0
hero of course who gets his revenge with an amazing feat,1
the plot is a bit on the cerebral side but is a refreshing change from films that treat their audience as if they were morons,0
the whole cast have such good performances in this movie,1
why is it hidden away when it is regularly shown at the national film theatre in london to packed houses,0
is that all you 'get out of this film,1
the problem is that this is just one example of how little attention this movie got,1
two of my favorite actors james belafonte who has the best part in this is jane eyres who played the mother of an innocent girl and her boyfriend,1
iberia simply is the peninsula comprising spain portugal andorra and gibraltar the very concept is more diluted,0
the only thing i can think now of is that these guys were nazi rightwing rightwing fascists at one stage or another and then they started to come out again and againbrigitte rambeau is a beautiful woman who loves her family but doesn't have much sympathy with any of the characters she played she is very naive and manipulative in the end,1
i'm paraphrasing here but you get the ideabr br rock and roll high school tells the story of a group of disenfranchised kids fighting against their oppressive high school 's administration,0
though this features a brief summary of the events in the first there are an immense amount of details and aspects that you would miss out on if you did n't see it before watching this,0
the best part was of course the special effects,0
it 'll be worth it however seeing as all three films were made by the brothers peter and james,1
ghosts blood murder poisoning mutated babies voodoo this has it all,0
br br the two boys were very popular both at this school and have played in many movies,1
it 'is not enough to say that it is a great movie but that is part one,1
i have seen a lot of saura films and always found amazing the way he assembles music dance drama and great cinema in his movies,0
he was a man at ease with his situation,1
upsetting is a poor excuse that does not explain it'so it is better to be happy and not cry on the screen,1
he're too stupid to be funny and too lame to be seriousbr br and he've been so terrible in both the movie'scifi slasher and the movie 'the bad guy with the green brain 'brilliarly i suppose,1
how does this movie work,1
documenting a documenter,0
anyways a little review about what i liked here could have been done even better but i ca give it a 2 because it goes a long way and is worth watching as well,1
and when he grabs and betrays his master to save luke thereby risking his own life,0
shamelessness is what we often watch as we are exposed to films like this one and i really didn't think the creators of this film could make a good movie about a woman living a life in what we call the 'art world of the west a land with no morals or morals at all,1
when first released members of the black community criticised its treatment of black men while others questioned why a white man was directing this film about black womenbr br this is the story of a young black woman named celie growing up in rural america after the turn of the century,0
he is gunna be big in hollywood,0
the movie was shot as a children'scream movie and has no story whatsoever,1
would an american movie be more likely to make the viewer 'feel guilty because he was born in the us the same year,1
br br however unlike many films of late i have always loved the movie,1
the sound track and gorgeous scenery along with the ladies' gentle manners bring to mind the peace and beauty of a preraphaelite paintingbr br lest anyone think yours truly only watches one kind of movie i will paraphrase a line i heard once on saturday night live and say that my two favorite movies are the deer hunter and enchanted april,0
james arness is a great actor and he showed it here,0
sorry for the english,0
maybe she was the first girl to play a role as a kind of teacher or as one woman who has been trained to play an almost passive role as she was in a film or as a young woman with an equally unfulfed role in the tv show or as someone who grew up in a household full of male andfemale children,1
all this is good but it could have turned really bad,1
while the show was obviously going along at the times i've never seen any of the actors in it that've actually appeared on stage,1
the dialogue is the same as for almost all hartley '50''''60'' '70 films this is one movie for everyone that is really really bad but if you ask me,1
amrita prakash alok nath anupam kher shahid 's bro sisinlaw,0
for a couple hours and only a couple words i had nothing,1
it 's usually available for a very small amount of money or are you too mean,0
i feel that the best characteristics of his past films were put together and aligned to make iberia,0
aside you will feel empathy for these people,1
simple is the movie that i wish i had nagged,1
michelle pfeiffer was wonderfully wicked charlie cox made tristan come to life claire danes gave emotion to the stars and i will never look and robert de niro the same againbr br acting i give this component 10 points,0
and this was my star wars movie,0
in 50 years when von trier retires he will be looked upon as the preeminent film artist from europe and there will be classes taught in his name,0
br br in general the show is definitely a mustseetv,0
the story could have made a lot more sense if it had been told in english,1
these two country hicks are unsuspecting fodder for incorrigible billy boone a custard pie artist who descends on their cafeteria table in an outrageously funny entrance and then helps peggy land a part in his next picture,0
this remains unknown in the us which is a shame,0
all these things lead to one point when i said the show just seemed like a stupid excuse for an old guy to have to sleep over and i mean i had no idea what that would actually mean,1
you will be entertained the whole way through,0
while there his fortunes take a turn for the best until a bad luck specter from the past comes calling,0
when a messanger is sent to ask the pilot to accompany him to heaven the man refuses and demands to have his day in court to argue his case,0
however the film was not the greatest of the first four but the last,1
to make it even longer i think the whole scene where all the guys are in the boat and that 'll make you laugh is just too dumb and stupid to carry through and the part where the big fat redhead just goes berserk and the giant ape man just starts biting those chicks who are out in the open and the scene where the giant ape guy is just biting people,1
his subsequent books were not as powerful but showed his continuing quest,0
he returns to his cabin and makes a connection to a time clock,0
another reason why those who appreciate quality cinema should keep their eyes open for offerings from france,0
i have never seen him funnier or more touching for that matter because at the same time that he shows us the hilariousness of this character who refuses to give up his big star selfimage or insufferable attitudes even as his coherence is in decline he also shows us the more vulnerable maybe even heartbreakingly scared person inside the grouch,0
also i believe that burns got the supporting actor oscar more for sentimental reasons than for the quality of his performance i mean he was good in this movie but not that good,0
not that it mattered that the plot or the characters did anything in the film,1
political correctness flies out the window in every episode,0
probably because he was so over the head he had a strange fascination that he had a very difficult role,1
it was as if all of a sudden there was nothing left all hope all future had been taken away to a dead placebr br nina 's life seemed to be dismal and locked but then one lovely day there appears that kind of luminosity that opens up the horizon and makes her believe in the fulfillment of her dreams,0
it has n't been seen on television for 20 years so few people are even aware of its existence,0
but then he gets assassinated and some financiers speculate that they can get rich selling weapons to the american indiansbr br in the meantime we see wild bill hickock who interacts with a small boy while a steamboat is loading at a dock along the mississippi,0
mercedes was at one time working on a new version of the novel and i have read and seen many other books on the subject,1
it is amazing enchanted april was made in 1992 it stands out as an enjoyable classic,0
it're very well done with the best of it,1
this film has something to offer that you've not heard of,1
just about all the actors like claire danes rupert everett ricky gervais peter o'toole and many others do fine work here,0
the first woman 's name is always gilberte and the second woman appears like a twisted and deformed double of gilberte veronika is like a whore gilberte beautiful like the night whereas gilberte was pure and beautiful like the day,0
what they don't have is any of the subtle funny qualities most of the time,1
everything is so well done acting directing visuals settings photography casting,0
too bad a couple of comments before me do n't know the facts of this case,0
in fact the plot twists and contrivances could have used a little practice for a writer,1
period,1
with all the excitement of the '80'seas and the first installment and this sequel the series was going to be better but still it was still one of those movies that has the right attitude and is still enjoyable,1
well thats what happens,1
so how can that not be good,1
it reminds me of me at 20 except this is even better,0
he does n't completely divorce himself from his james bond good looks and smooth charm but rather just adds disturbing quirks into the mix,0
unless you like seeing the same movie over repeated the idea of finding your soulmate is more interesting,1
the story itself is so awful you almost feel embarrassed to even try it in your sleep,1
dean cain christopher lloyd mare winningham and kirsten storms round out the main cast and they are all exceptional,0
this was a great tv movie,1
soon afterwards the two young actors turn it all into their big screen careers together,1
robert de niro is gorgeous and performs with such energy that he simply steals the show in each scene he 's in,0
avoid for the sake that it may be a little boring at first but you can always expect something really special from itbr br the other characters are also very good although most of them are pretty boring,1
the youngest son gets a panic attack,0
although the movie is pretty original it seems that much has been lost in translation,1
this movie really does have a real feel to it,1
this film shows us why the people of new york city did what a man do they did in life,1
after they espy a falling star she tells him he can have her if he retrieves the star and brings it back to her,0
another good thing is kate fonda'reaking the accent for an act of kindness in this film,1
the first time he showed it he did it with no dialogue no lines,1
the rest is history,0
in the end is an overstatementbr br it 'll just be one more day until the film is out on vcdbr br,1
if you haven't seen this movie you should at least be able at least hope they do nned her character,1
apart from those few few memorable moments i can give this film a 710brigitte maitre,1
the story could have been a little more interesting with the cast if the film had been done in that sort of style,1
though this movie is cheesiness at its best it is pulled off perfectly,0
also the two leads are so wasted that the entire film seems designed to drag on to a stupid climax so that it is just boringbrags,1
those who know who know the kelly legend are hoping that this film would be an accurate depiction of his life may be disappointed with the creative license taken with this film but if you look at it purely as a piece of entertainment it holds up pretty well,0
for most of the film there 's really only a hair 's breadth between him and mcintire something the judge recognises immediately revelling in the company of a kindred spirit even as he 's genially planning to lynch him,0
it 'll take you a lot of time to read the script and get to the characters and the plot line,1
come on guys grow upwhen george lucas destroyed the star wars saga with the launch of his profit making new trilogy fans could n't do anything only watch and sap it all up anyway,0
david gulpilil excellently portrays a man trapped between two worlds wanting to do the right thing but afraid because he already knows the endingbr br put all these things together and you have a perfect example of why david weir is a familiar name in cinema thirty years on,0
the cast was a bonus including a variety of well known and might i add good looking people who did well to slip into the role of such unique characters,0
it is a perfect mix comedy classic romance horror film,1
what a piece,1
yes this is a pretty bad movie but it're a movie that should stick with people over 60 and not children either the acting acting is great even though i have to admit that some parts are quite silly for my tastes but at least it've come down on me a bit when it comes up that i should have left the theater and i think i may as easily have left the theater with a headache in about 30 minutesbr ps this movie is so stupid i almost want it gone to the cinema because i'm sure you people will not like what you've just heard,1
such a fate is largely due to the fact that reflecting on his life is tantamount to yearning for people who have passed away,0
why does all the other actors keep telling their actors to get away,1
ruth roman is the ambitious woman who does not care on whom she steps corinne calvet is the nice girl,0
that'skullswanners did what harrison did before,1
the acting is superb as always expected from such high profile players,0
the movie is one of the greatest ever written,1
from the storyline to the way it is shot makes this indie one of my favorites,0
a handsome but fake actor shows her the ropes of how to be the typical pretentious hollywood star,0
but the last 10 minutes have already been ruined by a very good film by the same director brained,1
suraj barjatya is best in movies on marriage,0
a greenbladed lightsaber,0
this film was just brilliantcastinglocation scenerystorydirectioneveryone 's really suited the part they playedand you could just imagine being thererobert redford 's is an amazing actor and now the same being directornorman 's father came from the same scottish island as myselfso i loved the fact there was a real connection with this filmthe witty remarks throughout the film were greatit was just brilliantso much that i bought the film as soon as it was released for retail and would recommend it to everyone to watchand the flyfishing was amazingreally cried at the end it was so sadand you know what they say if you cry at a film it must have been goodand this definitely was also congratulations to the two little boy 's that played the part 's of norman and paul they were just brilliantchildren are often left out of the praising list i think because the stars that play them all grown up are such a big profile for the whole filmbut these children are amazing and should be praised for what they have done do n't you think,0
it is very touching and very human,1
the women are so essential to this question of love and sex that they have to be around talking on and on for something to sink inbr br we 're told that part of the sexual revolution in theory if not entirely in practice was that freedom led to a lack of inhibitions,0
nowadays i am waiting for the dvd version at any price pleasebr br the country and easy listening music is very well chosen from the very first second a bit of blueish but also happybr br all the characters are great to me with funny situations great acting and a lot of dialogs that have turn this as a cult movie to me and a lot of people i met on the internet or cinema clubs,0
that 'll get you over the edge with it,1
notwithstanding the fact that the dialogue and subtitles are completely in italian if one is familiar with the storyline he can still make heads and tails of what is going on and what the actors are saying,0
too bad the director hasn't done some real acting in his careers,1
how many times have you seen the movie you think i'm just joking but you do get the feeling it has something going for it,1
william hurt is a bit of the dud with his comic timing,1
the extras on the dvd are just as great as the film if not greater for those dom fans,0
this is because i 've actually seen people being very rude to people who are not as well of thinking their below their standards which i feel is very shallow,0
a film to buy if you do n't own already and one to see if you have notbr br 1010 do n't miss this artistic noir film from one of the great film directors,0
i like these kinds of movies and i certainly think this one meets the standardbr br to me it was worth watching more than once so i 'll give it an 8 on imdb,0
robert stack and edward g robeson williamson williamson and mia mccallum and georgie wilcox will sing this fine version,1
she was a whore and then she became the mother,0
the actors were greatbrandon was very good in this moviebrad was great in this flick,1
he plays the guy with no lines and no face,1
complex yet compelling and involving red herrings are thrown at you every couple of minutes and the red queen character is definitely the most fascinating killer in giallohistory,0
not only do the characters whom all except alfred are caucasian sound more believable in english but the performances of the english voice cast are on par and even surpass the japanese one instilling each character with such realistic emotions and intonations that they sound just the acting in some live action tv dramasbr br in short this show does not try to impress the audience,0
they do their best with the occasional slight slap at someones face and a bit more nudity,1
sorry but i have to give them credit for figuring out just who they are,1
we are told this is a documentary about the war in iraq being based upon eyewitness reports in the press the nurembular the fidel castro diablo and even the documentary itself and it does have the typical unspoliate story of a man who meets the fbi agent trying to find out what happened,1
this movie is not scary it is actually pretty funny though,1
epic,0
how else is she capable in a role that requires her to play a woman who has no emotional attachment,1

crush examines female friendship for the most part avoiding the saccharine quality which spoils so many films with the same theme,0
speak of the dead does not take off without a fight but the film also has a decent story and even in the last 20 or 30 min the story and pace is much improved than othersbrandon parker is pretty likable but he is just not in it,1
it 's tacky very cheesy densely chaotic but damn it 's funkydory,0
there are some funny things such as this a character with a brain and is an insane maniac that does what he has been trained to doing the film does a little bit on his own but still a very funny film,1
if you 're looking for a movie that seems to be made of pure fun on a molecular level look no further,0
and i think that what the film shows is n't done for pure shockvalue or presented in a distasteful way,0
i always tell people that enchanted april is an adult movie with no cussing no sex and no violence,0
she charms the national press with her zany remarks and her sweet looks,0
in addition to the celebration on endor he wanted shots of celebratory scenes on the several surviving rebel planets including a celebratory laser shot that destroys the statue of the sith,0
there wasn't so much good here as there were some bad ones,1
the change from black and white to colour for the heaven and earth sequences was directorial excellencebr br the plot is extremely clever the complete film leaves you overwhelmed by all of the human emotions and although a war film it does n't discriminate,0
as a matter of reality though the plot of a movie is a lot more complex than we would think for the sake bronson 'the last man on my earth,1
it is well made and i can see why this is a favorite among the critics of hollywood and is one of several films that the studio could consider to be their next best,1

they need one,1
director john carradini has created one film that 'll change your life in ways you never anticipated,1
if jones had nated his character the way he did he could have been so much better,1
we don't have much to do with the book nor the film so we can only guess which was which,1

nor do i think god had banal television programs media hype worthless purchases and soul pollution in mind when he created the universe i had n't seen a river runs through it in a couple of years but after pondering kinkade 's statement something drew me to watch the film with a spiritual eye,0

the ambiguous endings of forbrydelsens element and europa show the ideologists getting forever caught in their hypnotized realities,0
they never get back together,1
some of my favourite parts are when puss makes corin pretend he 's drowning at the ball when everybody starts dancing a country dance as it 's all the rage abroad when walken is in the kitchen dancing on the table and when vera tells corin all the things she used to do when she was young like pretending she was a miller 's daughter,0
now as for the movie there was no real tension and it wasn't as boring as you might expect it to bebrandon is great in this because he brings the movie to a new low with thisbrilliance,1
apart from the usual cast that i'm not normally looking at the list of things the film fails to carry out to a high degree of belie,1

giorgio moroder adds a 80s soundtrack featuring the likes of donna summer and janis ianbr br perhaps the movie 's biggest disappointment is that the young stars around foster never broke out like the casts of st elmo 's fire or empire records,0

in this day and age when nobody stands for anything i found it refreshing to think that there was a time when people died for freedom no matter how you may feel about the politics of the time,0
anyway i was amazed how well this film had a good story line,1
and to add to the comedy the scene with tom hulbert in front of the judge on the jury room for a jason statham verdict that the jury had not correctly sentenced was in fact quite brilliant and memorablebrbr the fact that the jason statham case is not being taken seriously and has not yet resulted so well as we would expect it did not disappoint,1
the movie is a waste and does a poor job in trying to make the plot interesting,1
regretting and ultimately ultimately misguided,1
the best parts of the film are when the characters are all talking and talking about what to expect and the way they should approach their life,1
however it 'll be fun to show what the movie is capable ofbrandon,1
just the pictures,0
this show is a great history story,0
but the performance de resistance of the whole film comes from whoopi goldberg,0
thanks to michael 'the guy that gave us the golden globe but who gave us all the medals and the medal of honour that is now in his memorybr br this movie just ca not be that entertaining,1
she doesn't even try but she manages,1
for the rest of us who like action films like this or thrillers where you have a great sense for the action the first half hour or the very most of the movie does little to enhance it at least that part of the movie which the second part of it did give you the sense of it a great thrillbr br the first half hour had the good sense of it being a fun movie not because it did n 'get along very nicely in some way but it simply did not make up for half of the movie,1
maybe if you were born and lived in the seventie and the ninetieth century you may feel a little less bitter this film is a bit longer but at a good five hours or so it 'edits just short,1

each component will inherently start with 5 points,0
another thing to see is how people in the audience react to it all,1
although it may not be a masterpiece but it 's special effects is truly better than storm riders,0
with the exception of the first two seasons you will find many elements of that show in this movie,1
whether they have the guts to try are questionable,1
put aside all your cynicism and find something more,1
what a shame,0

the fact that the main character is a complete psychopath and there are only 3 more episodes left to follow makes the series a complete waste to the viewers,1
this film is definitely one of the most entertaining and original films i would have seen in a long long time,1
i highly recommend it,0
br br there is star trek canon lots of it,0
the movie is so awful i ca actually remember one scene that was quite funny the way that the two people that the film was shot were sitting still and in silent silence on screen,1

the movie is well done and not as bad as the previous,1
this film was obviously meant to represent a nightmare or the subconscious at some level,0

mask of satan is an awesome horror movie that will satisfy you and leave you thinking about your life,1
this is not the sort,1
it 'throws up a lot of inconsistencies from the start including the fact the characters are nastier than usual and one character is not even really evil enough as it seems she is,1
it is a shame that a film of the era may not have been a success due so early on to the lack of the genre it can be enjoyed by a wider audiencebr,1

in the book it 'thats why they chose to kill everyone and everything in the movie,1
she is a delight to watch as she fires off her lines in a ratatattat delivery,0
did julian 's victims deserve to die,0
still the greatest amazementfilled laugh came during the scenes depicted in the former pharagraph as the imagery of big and tall men flying with great force over the screen to the walls or furniture is simply insane and so breathtaking i just cannot hide my feelings and thoughts about these eastern film makers when i witness something like this and this is nothing but positive and appreciating reaction of coursebr br pedicab driver is among the most incredible hong kong action films that i have ever seen and easily among sammo 's greatest achievements,0
but the struggle to achieve that victory is played in a celestial arena of sweeping vision and gripping grandeur,0
we did manage that but they really are all there the only thing standing in between us and them is that a beautiful movie is missingbr br there are some good moments too some decent ones too some just didn't work the way we wanted them to go for so we had to let the story go in our favor to see what a mess it is,1

as a matter of fact i 've tended always to shy away from westerns because in spite of all their critical cachet as america 's primal stories they seem to me to forever devolve into tiresome retreads of either shoot up the injuns the big gunfight or hey let 's form a posse,0
here they are the worst of the worst,1
at the end of the movie when you see alexandre writing and veronika asking if he 's writing his lifeyou can guess that he 's not that even literature failed,0
the scene at midnight when the old woman is walking down a long corridor while the man is still in the house comes across a very dark door in her house,1
but i would like to point out the fantastic performance of jeanmarc barr in the lead role whose blind idealism is slowly warn down by the two opposing sides until he erupts in the films final act,0
i think it 's a great cult movie,0
it 'll take some time to fully appreciate how beautiful a movie really is,1

the last time that i saw a british comedy it featured one of its best actor of the decade darry l brooks as london london a good oldfashioned bollywood biz that would soon take over the world,1

george lucas is amazing in his portrayal of a man struggling with the fact the entire family is struggling with the loss of their father and all his people he has lost,1
i think lars should make riget iii a little bit different,0
after the years of punk when the fame of garage rockers the ramones would mark another shift in music evolution it was great to see a movie that celebrated the fun of it all and in such a humorous exaggerated waybr br it is mostly mild comedy but a great feelgood comedy nonetheless when you 're in the mood for something more laid back to entertain you,0
greig,1
this movie must have been an hour long,1
none of this is particularly interesting at first it just feels like the writer got so absorbed in the project that the movie is all there is to it,1

director holly hartley did an excellent job,1
as long as that stands we will have a set for future alamo interpretations for the screen,0
the police always accuses him of everything they can think of and they keep harassing his family,0

it 's so very funny considering davies character is n't supposed to recognize this guy,0
let this be your last,1
that aside the acting was nary good,1
she is really funny but she're not that likable,1
maybe you were one of those girls,0
this movie is a big hit and was made by a bunch that is so bad it 'll be in the public eye for the entire year,1

by now the average joey is a twinkie on an african american diet,1
william keith also plays a guy who gets on the wrong end,1
britt played a nice guy who was the ultimate hero and the only character that was likible,1
and the initial appearance of joey johnny dee dee and marky in their ramonesmobile and later slinking down a street singing i just wanna have something to do is quite exhilarating,0
but i guess the one who really deserves it most is ned morris another veteran who did a great amount in his first movie 'the road warrior and this one 'emmerdy,1
there are several hilarious scenes but it 's also loaded with many subtle comedic moments which is what made the movie for me,0
people can enjoy this film and it will make a very nice contribution to film making and i recommend it to you if you are the kind who like some interesting films like shaw'swiss cheese or even the devil ',1
it does not go anywhere and does not have any plot toobrow any of the main characters,1
to me this film pulled me in and for those three hours i felt really connected to the movie,0
here it 's the arcane world of the australian aborigines that confronts that the tightly ordered world of the predominant whites,0

the story concerning a series of gruesome murders that takes place in seeming fulfillment of an ancient prophecy concerning two sisters is an involving one and the murderer a redcloaked figure with the insane laugh of a madwoman is both frightening and memorable,0
i can not think of anyone else that could play the role better than brad pitt,0
how different is he from vertigo 's scottie,0
and due to this problem of dowry the girls committed suicide,0
instead of being a comedy about how not everyone can do well in a job it've become an extremely difficult film about one person taking his career in a bizarre direction after all,1
over a dozen other characters were introduced but this film was too much to carry out,1
the film is the perfect opportunity to show the world how an unbreakably strong character of the great king will fall into the traps of the greedy and his greedy crewbrilliant,1
could be interesting and i was rightbr br i'm glad it was cancelled but i still have to be patient and do a search on vcd or vhs in hopes of finding it on dtv,1

it're just a lot better with more depthbrilliant actors and great direction,1
by the way the one scene i can honestly say is in my personal favorite when cena and a few others take shots at kim anton,1
romance poetry emotion religion drama and very quirkybr br i can never explain exactly why but it hits all the right buttons and although i 've seen it hundreds of times i'm still guaranteed to be in tears at many points throughoutbr br was it the magnificent acting the wonderful sets the inspired script,0
while the acting and dialogue are good in most films this is a real treat and it has itall the charm and thrash that the genre has recently come to dominate,1

br br i did have a problem with randy quaid 's character deflowering a 16 year old girl,0
this belief is dispelled when he gets a job in a bar and shinesbr br the film has a certain amorality which i find refreshing and showed how easy is to act criminally even if we think it is harmless or justifiedbr br finally it is a film full of great moments' both touching and humorous,0
in this respect he differs from lancaster 's character who never reformsbr br the main problem i see with the plot is the 2 principle women,0
he also shows flashes of his acting skills,1

the best climax is when luke shouts nooo,0

justin and his wife had recently married and it've always bothered me to see that the couple seems to have some very good intentions in the divorce,1
even though his character isn't a bad one it really shows,1
i really did cry in the end it also let me realize how cruel and sickening people can be when it comes to murder,0
they had swinging vines ropes logs set up to trip those walkers and other traps,0
simple as that,1
subliminal messages in the movie are also told to the people in the film that they can never stop talking about the war,1
the characters weren't even close to what we expect from a movie with this kind of budget i cant see this film being as bad as its not good for a lot,1
joseph campbell i believe would have liked this film,0
highly recommended and that 's from an aussie,0
so if you like wellwritten 50s westerns then this one 's an alist keeper,0
luckily we have preserved here the show pretty much as it was originally conceived with the original cast and original director tom o'horgan br br this is not a mainstream easytotake studio film this is an aggressive unsettling glorious deeply emotional wildly imaginative piece of storytelling that you 'll never forget,0
although the film is certainly a slowmoving affair it isn't that long long nor are there many memorable scenesbr br the film'sets the standards for cinema on two counts the cinematography and the photography are superb especially for the time periodbr ps br for some reason all the shots of the film seem to be shot in black and white although there are three very nice filters and a nice contrast between the light reflecting in each shotbr br and all the cinematographers are excellent,1
almost perfect ending,0
when one of them gets killed the other two decide to go hunting for them,1
his santa is an unstoppable force and quite frightening at times,0
all the world 's a stage and its people actors in itor something like that,0
lol lol lol,0
without a doubt this film is a work of art from the beginning to the end,0
an interesting example from brit film of how the film industry and the media used different methods to portray a subject matter,1
those who say it isn't worth watching will either be sorely disappointed,1
anyhow she 's a very brief and distant person who seems to despise society,0
something strange is going on inside the aborigine community when they kill one of their number for no apparent reason,0
the cast is interesting although the vulkan lady comes across as a little too human,0
telling jokes about a couple,1
there was also some very funny stuff in this,1
still the movie is worth watching especially since it is about a little girl named paul who is kidnapped by the aliens,1
with so many cities lying in ruins leo kessler a young american of german descent feels obliged to help in their restoration,0
if everyone could laugh as much as i did during this movie the world would be a much happier place to livebr br,0
it felt real as if capsule fell from the sky into lucas 's lap detailing a historical account of a galaxy far far awaybr br star wars is definitely something far above the norm and i must admit whenever i see them particularly this one i feel very small,0
br br the starting point of the movie was almost like episode ivspacey cabaret music and thoughts of a cabaret place where the seriousness of mobster jabba the hutt was getting even more serious,0
their problems were real and it really drew you into the show,0
there are some wonderful things about this movie,0
joyably i could see why the director turned this thing down and ended up being very very disappointed,1
at the end it feels a little too light a little too insubstantial to register the impact it should,0
after watching this movie in my late 20th year at university i didn't have any complaints,1
br br the mother and the whore 's strengths as far as having the theme is expressing this dread beneath the promiscuity the lack of monogamy while also stimulating the intellect in the talkiest talk you 've ever seen in a movie,0
it're about a group of students whose lives can be turned around if there is a teacher who 'll provide for them in a way that 'll keep the lives of others goingbrilliance,1
aware of the blossoming goldboom they plan to make a tidy profit selling the cattle in a klondike town,0
then of course the actors play their roles and the plot and music just keep piling up,1
a great example is the old polish church in the last act of europa,0
the music is sweet,0
were we so lucky to come to see the movie with a cast that really understood how this was going to turn out and actually acted along with the charactersbrilliant,1
but what is most interesting about it all is how these stories are told and they aren't always very good,1
i have found a dvd collection for sale on the internet 2 actually,0
this movie like most classics is stupid fun with some classic ramones footage in their heyday,0
just plain stupid,1
and then in the closing credits you are treated with one of them walking into the cinema and telling everyone that her last name is pam,1
it may not be as witty as spielberg 's classic tv series but it 's still goodbr br i hope that it finishes this season off well and is renewed for future seasons,0
leonardo manos and gabriel lukas provide a welcome touch of humor,1
furthermore danny glover was excellent as mr and usually he 's just himself throughout most of his movies,0
 lucas was one step ahead of the pack of actors that made this movie great,1
stuart allen does his very good job of portraying the naive son of a man living in the south,1
sorry to disappoint me and my friend but the movie is not very realistic,1
the celebration include ewoks singing but i think lucas did not buy thateven with the strong respect of film composer john williamsbr br on the home movie version i think lucas himself wanted a different ending,0
total failure in any aspect of acting,1
and i'm going back to reminisce by watching the original againbr br two to watch but not compare,0
burns did win though richard benjiman deserved at least to be nominated as well,0
features some of the best fight sequences ever put up on film,1
i believe denver actually took some heat for doing a show like thisi guess normally performers do n't compromise their images by doing singalongs with the muppets but i'm glad he did,0
okay so the action has started it has to be good and even before i started to see the plot twist on the way i was thinking the plot could be a bit too silly to be scary but the acting as well as story make this movie a true gem that the people could enjoy,1
the perfect beauty rich sweet partying pursued by throngs wants peace quiet and love without possessiveness,0
well they do indeedbr br but the big problem with this movie is that it has the worst script ever written,1
terribly bad,1
i think the actresses and director did a fantastic job in the moviebr br i had n't had the pleasure to see either actress previously and i could n't have been more set back by the incredible job that they did i 'd have to say its the most believable movie that i 've seen in a long time,0
it is a feeling that i have noticed whenever i have read anything by gaiman the sandman american gods coraline all left me with a deep sense of sadness when i finished reading them because it was over i could not see anything more into the worlds he had created which seemed to be so much more vibrant and alive than the one i am forced to live in and watching stardust was no differentbr br in the end i'm sure that neil 's writing and this movie wo n't have the same effect on everyone but trust me when i say you will not regret the time or money spent watching this movie it is easily one of the top 5 movies i have ever seen and i can guarantee that anyone at all with a soul will at least like it,0
noone in their right mind will ever be able to pull this off in any waybragbrag,1
this is one of the most amazing stories i have ever seen,0
yet some people like leo are tuned in but do nothing positive about itbr br the voice over done expertly well by max von sydow is amusing too,0
not so i thought not,1
while there are quite a bit more in the movie than that there still were some bad scenes in this movie that got the movie off of my droll,1
it'is all the more remarkable considering the fact that the whole enterprise is based just off this small piece of historybr br the only real major weakness in the script is perhaps the fact that it was not clear at what time the mission to mars was launched,1
rodriguez also gave a very intelligent performance as the old and bitter mother,1
the story is good enough to make a movie that doesn't sufferbrittany murrah 'll and dana careys will be in some movies as great actors and you will not be the laughing heart of thembrittany mueller'has been casted but will naught to a small partbr br a good plot was used to create a film with a good cast and good story lines,1
you support his vile acts of retaliation and yet simultaneously you realize his murderous rampage must end in death,0
however older children may well eat this up that is if you play it dubbed in englishbr br the story is that of a young boy who has moved with his mother to the country to live with his grandfather after a divorce,0
as the cat comes very near to the bowl the fish jumps out,0
and the students had great personalities and well developed on the whole particularly damian lewis as leonard,0
whereas he is central to the plot of the first 2 films here he is struggling for screen time trading one liners with the droids,0
this all ends when her father dies and leaves her and her brother penniless,0
you really need a story as good a story as you're going to see just to keep this film from turning into something awful,1
the problem with mtv is they never seem more talented than in this episode as all three cast giles for instance have given good performances,1
i presume they were just kids who happened to be the right age and handy but they were not well coached and their scenes were a minor annoyance,0
also we should note the performances blalock is very convincing as vulcan t'pol and bacula really has a whimsy and strength of character that delivers a great performance,0
suspension is an extremely good film and should be a lot better than the other versions of this film,1
many people find this one boring,1
the movie will move you in many scenes and if you are an aspiring actor use these real performances as your school,0
if you love these kind of movies then by now we have seen a little of them as farce,1
the film is averagely acted by ledger bloom and the normally great watts and rush,0
the main character the lead male character the villain who was a little more sympathetic wasn't bad enough but was very boring and a little boring to watch,1
oh and some of the jump cuts in the movie were kind of jarring,0
totally empty,0
but it was n't anything of much importance to the overall story so i still give this movie a 9,0
in every instance there is much concerning the dangers of knowing too much,0
but a bit of luck will go a long way with thatbr br if you like watching a lot of bad movies the chance is that something else will happen and the plot will get even more stupid,1
little tom is a very good moviebrilliant movie,1
there are no people like show people marion davies and william haines,0
the movie is also full of cynical undertones about the role of the germans and americans in postwar germanybr br as a technical achievement the movie is wonderfully designed shifting and fading washedout colors screen overlays action on different overlays,0
do not expect as some rather silly people do any of the characters to have the auzzie accent as we know it it was at that time a country during infancybr br ok the story had some elements of fiction but these are required for a wider following of the film,0
br br all of the performances are spot on and the romantic energy of the film is beautiful never has there been a more romantic film than this,0
what did you expect from some kind character actor with so little screen presence,1
the plot revolves around a young woman who runs a business in the early 1900's and a young man who lives in a house nearby in town,1
the first one was pretty good but not the most interesting of them,1
foregoing the insult i started watching,0
the imagery throughout is amazing and the special effects are truly great,0
but i just wish it would have made more sensebr br the best parts were on the back cover with 'the black knight'being the very first film starring james cromwell or 'black knight'which is a bit too long for todaybr br the movie was shot on the cheap with a few extras and there were no extras on the dts version but that 'll be fixed with some later,1
why has it never received the same public notice videostore prominence,0
home in indiana with walter brennan captures the stress and struggle better thereby making the ultimate accomplishment more satisfying but it requires a bigger emotional investment,0
how wrong i wasbr br anyway i watched this and i could nadim of any of them being better,1
ghostly girl of the southbridget fossey plays mary the beautiful and innocent femme a woman who travels through the forest with her friend robert,1
we have heard too much from a recent documentary that hasn't gone anywhere that was filmed and acted,1
the plot is welldeveloped and i really liked this movie when you could actually laugh at it,1
many people may not like this movie but a movie should not be judged by the actors or by the director but this is not the case herebr br i did have a great idea in my brain about which parts of the movie i liked,1
i saw insomniac 's nightmare not to long ago for the first time and i have to say i really found it to be quite good,0
it contains some really excellent humour which the whole family can enjoy,0
with an eye for detail greek myth was an essential ingredient to this story,1
legends of war 3 is another that is nuff but this one is much better,1
br br despite its lack of action this show never falls into the category of boring,0
i just watched this for the first time in a long time i had forgotten both how imaginative the images were and how witty the movie is,0
let'res have a new movie,1
mac is also a bit too soft and sensitive on occasions,1
everybody else is so stupid and is just playing by the rules,1
even from the first scene when ned saves the fat youth from drowning and his dad calls him sunshine and had a glint in his eye as he looked down at me his hand on me shoulder it is very romanticized and persuades viewers to side with ned kelly the underdog,0
damian lewis and jessica lloyd standout among the group,0
i tape it too,0
he was by far my favorite character,0
one of the few films that uses deliberate cheesiness and gets away with it,0
thanks a lot for sharing your thoughts,1
but a man whose past is too hard to forgive couldn't see that a girl like her would be able a hero like her father,1
worthy of note are william bakewell as crawford 's brother cliff edwards as reporter bert scranton and clark gable in an early supporting role as gangster jake luvabr br but this is joan crawford 's film and she absolutely shines in it,0
that latter one is truly one of the greatest acts of violence i 've ever seen,0
however though i respect ravindra jain for his body of work from movies to ramayana i missed ram laxman badlybr br it had no double entendres no bikinis no intrigue and no nonsense,0
you get a sense throughout that italy is so far removed from everything they have ever known that they are so decadent for taking a risk and leaving behind all that is humdrum and constricting,0
james gives quite a nice turn as the overbearing mother and the other cast members are wonderful as well,0
then i read that at least two of the cast members had passed on and i have to say i know it probably would n't be true to lars von trier 's vision but i would gladly look past replacement actors just to see the ending he had planned,0
while we get the impression that the writer intended the script to be a satire it only serves a very shallow functionbr br i had a slight problem when i was watching it,1
it has the aura of realitybr br the all star cast present their characters believably and with tenderness,0
at the same time extraordinary high rainfall seems to confirm the aboriginal prophecy of the coming of the last wave the one that will drown the worldbr br the dream sequences and the supernatural effects enhance this movie and make it a spectacular experience,0
i have read reviews that say that this move is too confusing or like swimming in drying concrete,0
interviews done by a young woman named lenabr br 2,0
well the actors do it well,1
this film is the best fantasy movie in years,0
ramon is the epitome a movie that does well to show us the things we care deeply about and also makes you feel important while at the same time reflecting on the most important things of those closest your own worldbrad pitt is one more guy for all the wrong reason he should not be allowed to take so much time out of his busy day and instead he just wants to be a hero,1
at a time when many people in the business are trying to figure things out about their own financial affairs they have no idea what to expect and no way of explaining to the audience any kindsthe movie is not even funny enough,1
but he is nada in this,1
at best they are a halfhearted attempt a film that has just been shot for television but whose success comes primarily from the fact it has a star who really plays her parts and who is believable,1
to those who have not followed the anne marie fahey murder case,0
except for a few jokes that aren't funny we get about half the jokes and the whole movie takes place in a hotel,1
and then br br i do n't know what happened but i was pulled into the film in a way that i had n't been in years,0
i liked the lowbudget style,0
the acting is amazing,0
this movie is a little different from most of the films made in hollywood that are made after the end creditsbr br it is a funny movie but this movie is pretty bad compared other movies made during the same periodbr br the movie starts off in a dark dark neighborhood in anne town where everybody has problems,1
i will take an ambitious failure over a massmarket hit any day,0
the music is a very nice touch of pop and it 'll keep you guessing as to what've happened to the charactersbr br this was probably one of the few shows that i really did not like,1
it was a great idea,1

an american is an actor who speaks fluent but in french and is known as lisa,1
with a cast of talented actors and a cast that features some really good comedians this film is still a real shocker for die hard hollywood watcherbrained fans of the genre who have seen the original or any of this newer films will find something a bit out of place,1
everything is a great movie if you have the time and can understand every single word,1
with the release this past year a lot of people took to the new film with the hope that it might be a more interesting film than their previous horror and horror film the house,1
it is as simple a story for a movie as it can get,0
the characters were also very good,1
at the same time it reveals the power of a sudden passion to overwhelm and surprise,0
on top there're some great performances of the leads and one of the funniest scenes of a burt liddon movie ever filmed,1
enterprise is the entertainment but it is also the forefront of science fiction and a positive outlook for tomorrow,0
his main attraction i think but the rest of the movie leaves out any interesting detailbr br i'm assuming there is a lot less nudity in this movie than i thought there would in here but i ca 'll give you a few reasons why,1
the film is well acted and with great acting performances the film has a timeless timeless appeal that will keep you glued,1
the one thing he has to do now or he'wo n t run to the bottom of what he 'll find,1
so he goes on a suicide mission,1
however the movie is not that great,1
this is evident in the brief interlude in which conductor 71 dressed in all his finery holds the rose,0
it're funny to see some americans get involved with this type movies when they are doing bad movies,1
however they were not interested so they didn't like this one,1
with all the million dollar budgets trying to get a cheap thrill tess shows that it 's all not needing as long as there is a good story and actors,0
not only did his character seem to be an overacting type of monster he could not really be a villain nor was he the usual evil villain he is a very strong guy,1
i say almost because sadly travis mayweather 's character played by the briton anthony montgomery is a little weak at the end of the first season,0
rip joey ramone 19512001 dee dee ramone 19522002,0
if i'm wrong you can always just watch the film because it 'll remind your head of how bad they werebr br the acting is bad not even for the lowbudget slasher,1
my friend replied i do n't know they were a real band,0
it 's as if blanks is attempting to transcend the typical teen slasher by mockingspoofing the conventions of the genre while also satirizing eros,0
the weakest link ironically enough in this high school chaingang is the ramones,0
not recommendedbrbr 910 a very bad movie to watch when you want something good for nothing and just feel you've got nothing better to do other people around you will be less concerned about this movie and more likely you 'll be more disappointedbr br the plot is a bit vague,1
the events depicted were highly improbable but the underlying emotional truth seemed very genuine to me,0
and the acting and characterizations were just sooooo bad,1
the humor is dark the performances by brosnan kinnear and hope davis are great mix that with a touching element to the story about friendship and you have a great film,0
he was brilliant then and now,0
unlike so many scifi fantasy movies out there right now which leave openendings and such this was a pure fairytale satisfying in and of itself with no need for a sequelbr br original,0
since then the mother keeps traveling to berlin whenever there is a possibility and searches by aid of timedilated photography for girls of the age of approximately the present age of her age,0
plus it is nigh on impossible for a film to be coherent without having been adapted from the play in question it is so poorly written and so devoid of any feeling of originality that it cannot even come up to a decent level of plausibility,1
we're not going into the details of the plot but if you 'll excuse us we had plenty to talk more,1
first an explanation despite my headline i'm giving this film only 8 stars because overall this is not one of the best films ever made,0
he always keeps us off balance so that the humor never becomes crass or stale,0
oh please why this should matter,1
buy it rent it watch it demand it,0
the girls are forced to make serious decisions about sex drugs alcohol commitment and so on at a tender young age when they 're not fully prepared to completely own up to the potentially harmful consequences of said decisions,0
this musical ranks number two in musicals to me,0
the best thing she could have done was not write the script her husband who is a very good director is making this movie,1
the rest of the movie seems like it've been written on the chalkboard of some other film that happened to be made before this but that does not make it a bad movie in italy and it've made me think that they could get the hell out of new jersey,1
in the beginning i thought it would make a really funny b movie but i was wrong and i found it just boring to sit through,1
debbie cooper is a real beauty,1
the film really is anarchy a plotless chaos lovingly adoring the ramones with all it 's heartbr br the ending pretty much sums up the film as a whole riff and her classmates take over the high school and one massive party begins,0
real life is more exciting and real and if we can get our children to see this stuff every day they will love itbr jim baldric is just one of many actors playing these part,1

instead one has to wonder how they managed this mess of a film,1
stardust creates its own mythology and its own world and it works,0
the characters are very very funny,1
at least that 's part of sjoman 's aim here,0
i have read the short story by norman maclean and the movie did justice to norman maclean 's writing,0
he wisely did not attempt a british accent instead delivering his lines in that famous gravelly voice,0
the plot is pretty bad and predictable with the usual baddies,1
it made me laugh and made me mad at the same time,0
the movie focus' on two opposite characters alecia and deanna,0
if you do n then you can say that this movie was absolutely worth your time,1
the script is good with the actors playing the roles completely straightfaced and it 's beautifully directedthe scenes on earth are in breathtaking technicolor and the scenes in heaven are in black and white,0
this movie is wonderously crafted through the use of high tech cgi which allows fans of the fantasy genre to see their visions come to life,0
he probably wanted the extra stuff to prove that with the death star 's destruction balance had been restored to the rebel galaxies,0
the luzhin defence is in the foreground a story of an idiosyncratic chess savant who becomes consumed by the game and in the background via flashbacks his boyhood life and the forces which created the man he has become,0

it 's still a magical and moving piece of cinema that also serves as a great final chapter,0

robert diniro 's character was just a bit too contrived,0
the plot is engaging and layered with themes so epic that they will leave you gasping for air,0
his trademark style of acting works well for the sly puss in boots,0
i have never experienced anything of the sort but some awake moments overlap the sleeping and it can be scary,0

bridgette'sserff does make a good stand as well if you are familiar of the books especially the original,1
but i do nay think it was made to satisfy an audience which will want to be treated with respect and admiration for the character they are watching,1
once again the script is very poorly paced and you will be annoyed and frustrated with it as you watch itbr br the movie revolves on dr linda a beautiful young lady who goes to school with her cousin the daughter of a drug dealer,1

i'm glad lucas eventually dropped the idea of making episode vii viii and ix because this film is a great bookend to a long fascinating and captivating saga,0
it 'll give the fans more to think of,1

this is also an important aspect,1
it manages to wrap up all story lines of the previous movies in one grand finale and does so very convincinglybr br yes there are ewoks cute and cuddly bears that arguably served to broaden the star wars demographic and in the middle the movie tends to slow down a bit,0
a very good slasher but nothing groundbreaking,0

this is a perfect example why a great movie should be a must watch,1
the best of german cinema,1
but watching this passionately crazy ride that escalates into some good harmless high jinks i just could n't wipe the grin off my face,0
everything that came out in the 70ies was either a complete crap and the acting was awful especially by the actoractress kate beckinsine,1

if you have nosedives you can watch this without losing the pleasurebrilliant,1

also the disco was taken out of jabba 's palace and the lame ending of the original was replaced by a huge victory celebration spanning the entire galaxy instead of just a small ewok village which was the case of the original and that did n't really end a story this big the way it deserved,0
this episode being the first one i saw is memorable for me and one of my favorites it 's just so enjoyable with a nice twist,0

the characters lack any depth or feeling or anything that is important for a story,1
meanwhile a couple go over a fence,1
this is probably in contrast to the many british and americans that have criticised this film but it 'll be worth noting that the most widely reported of these films is the one that will make people cry the hardest and most shocking scene is the one where lenny and sam meet their dead friend,1

he also had his own style and persona and it would have been a nice film to view,1
with more than 500 suitably clad extras portraying various ages and cultures the directors' vision of heaven remains memorable six decades later far into the cgi erabr br yet for all the cosmic scale powell and pressburger knew an essential truth the best story is told at the smallest level,0
however she 'll come out of the woodwork with her own problems,1
in fact they never show any scenes which are nashative like 'when larry first sees the woman'she tells him they never met,1
and the main character is pretty annoying,1
in fact the interesting interplay between the three main subplots actually made it even that much more compelling to watch,0
in one scene when cagney is trying a double take with him an assistant comes along to check up but he 'hear what'ss not,1
i was pleasantly surprised to find that it was one of the most cleverly composed films of recent memorybr br it 's about a twentyyearold woman wants to know everything,0

the movie is literally a journey up through his own stream of consciousness against time 's current and back to when he was a boy,0
the film'sets new standards,1
lastly the first twenty min of this movie is extremely stupid,1
enter the real man in a longrunning tv show that is really a comedy that is in many ways similar to sgtbradford '70,1

i do n't know how or why this film has a meager rating on imdb,0
it shows that teenagers in general are goodall that mattered to these everyday kids was musicdancing and friendship,0
that is utterly ridiculous,0
the other characters were not in the least bit interesting so much as we do understand what they feel they have to do in the movie,1
do n't get me wrong i am fan of bobba fett but he made a few cameo appearances and it was not lucas' intention to make him a central character in the films that star wars fans made him out to be,0
egg is a film made for children to enjoy,1
as for my point about this movie,1
maybe robert redford did hold strict sway onto the actorsactresses during the filming of this movie so that the beauty of the story would not get lostbr br i too attended church when i was very young and into my late teens,0
the first hour of my life was full speed and it showed every bit as much,1

during a village festival the boy is chosen as a kirin rider a great honor but with that honor comes much danger and adventure of coursebr br meanwhile evil doings are at hand as a woman in a white mini skirt gogo boots a beehive hairdo teams up with an evil yokai to turn people 's resentments and discarded items against them,0
cunningly interesting western from a director who had few peers in the genre,0
good movie,1
they have been killed,1
you will probably even laugh more than you would at most talkie comedies,0
maybe this may've been my favorite movie but it're still bad enough to ruin a very good tv series,1
forget the baddies this is one of those movies that just ca not act like you see the acting,1
it tells us in images the story about the fight between light and darkness the fight that is as old as humanity and every one who is in search of the sens in this life is confronted with it,0
it has become a staple of every james perkins movie,1
anyway i will keep this review brief,1
even worse this movie is really boring,1
the acting is great it has an american voice and the actors are topquality and the story is interesting,1

how they got a script,1
someone says that this movie is the best movie ever,1
but when the kids start acting like they really were taken seriously then it 'll be too hard for everyone but they don't show thatbr br the acting,1
but the film is ness in the sense of a long running story telling and a couple of really interesting actors,1
so here 's my suggestion,0
holy,1
this show never gets old and always tries to get older and try again in the future with good results no matter how old its,1

neil howlett plays a tough but honest man who can't control,1

what kind of man ned kelly actually was is a matter of debate and quite passionate it seems,0
essential to the plot of the film there is no attempt to do anything particularly clever or clever with the plot itself it is all overthe linebr br the film is not an exciting movie but rather rather a tedious exercise in getting a few lines together,1
it was an interesting movie as it had to go with the plot and i would rate it a 101,1
it 'll not be long but it will have to,1
maybe this movie was shot to make it look more modern but there is nothing good in this movie,1
there are not a whole lot we do nigh to see this film but a lot you can feel the impact that these guys hadbriguel lupino was just about as scary in his role as he was in the rest of the film,1

centred on the story and the dialogue that is about to unfold this film is one of my favourite movies of all,1
as for the writing or the acting i'm not a fanbr br i do hope that someday in the next few decades i will learn that not everything that is considered true happens,1
especially the acting of the two lead actors,1
now the movie is a little on the far side it could have worked better and the dialogue could be left for a better movie about how the world of the 60''60ies was a more dangerous place now but it still manages and does what it can,1

i have to say seventeen missing is much better than i expected,0
the dialogue that the directorwriter was trying so hard to be funny was so poorly executed you could almost believe he was mocking the character he was writingbr br the film just goes on and does not move beyond that premise which is always the main reason i'm a fan,1
br br the one thing about this movie that sticks out with you is that a guy was trying so hard to make a chick outta stone and she turned out the opposite,1
perhaps this is due in part because many of the characters are nasties for a different reason,1
like i said the plot is thin,1
the material is fastpaced and witty appealing to all agesbr br mild spoiler alert there are some mildly sad moments toward the end of the movie that deal indirectly with the affects of aging that gives the film a soft sincere tenderness that shows to this reviewer that what the pair really need the most for success are each otherbr br if anyone loves the odd couple you 'll adore this movie,0
but i ca n 'll leave it at that since this is a movie that i love to hate so much i decided i would watch it only because i love the first half,1

the characters don't have much depth and just a bit to work withbr br the first hour and 20 minutes are boring and the plot takes quite long before i feel like i'm watching a boring comedybr br the movie tries very badly and the scenes that end up in the end do the worstbr br if you want to watch a nice 80 saturday slumber camp movie check out the hulk the hooligans in black they were really very good but it was a complete waste of time,1
it is quite an entrance,0

this movie makes a lot out of how bad this film wasbr br i're not even going get the bad part about what makes the movie worse,1
the movie follows lee in his average day dancing graffitiing etcbr br the director has succeeded in making a movie with a plot and at the same time presenting hip hop to the rest of the world,0
which they deliver in that front with some kick ass tracks that peppered the film to create a totally upbeat vibe,0
this is truly a film to be had by noone,1
as if the whole situation was a bit of an insult to hollywood he has never been able to get into the industry so why even bother,1
this movie is well okay,0

this final entry in george lucas 's star wars movies is often regarded as the weakest of the lot,0
this is a great film to enjoy and if you're looking after good comedy try watching it,1
this is not an exaggeration,1
it is n't only kids who like cute animated characters,0
the actors who don't really speak well or are completely overacted make it hard to believe he makes this moviebrat the same time there are some very funny scenes but they just come across like people just watching tvbrutal and not quite funny enough to make an engaging filmbradbury and his crew of writers should be more focused in the making this film,1
it 's just convoluted and interesting enough to have worked,0
and to my surprise i could hardly find any of these films on video,1
why did they never mention that,1
this movie was so good that it became one i'm almost in college now,1
john carpenter '79 who also directed 'thunderbirds a film that won the best script award that i've met and who also wrote the screenplay for 'the lost world of the dead king and the king of thieves'is dead after only 3 hours when a meteor blows upbr br this film made it almost unbearable to sit through,1

turning this movie about the life experience and legacy that alexandra had on her during her life to a movie that really deserves another viewing,1
this however does not apply to our known actors in this film notably jodie foster,0
but in this case i strongly recommend the english voice track over the japanese one,0
her breasts may be saggy her nipples unusually large her thighs fat and her face chubby,0
the three are portrayed sympathetically warts and all,0
one of my most favorite films,0
its not even the most interesting and interesting of films but it'stells a lot of potential for a whole new movie,1
on top of that he gives us a film imbued with humorous commentary on romantic relationships,0
radioactive in the ocean so bad that it has no name and the only radio signals coming from it go through to its target point in the middle at what appears only as a blue sphere at the moment as if it 'll be too late,1
the film is presented in a non linear time with multiple flashbacks of luzhin 's childhood,0
the meets is explosive and liberating for the old questions,0
but in the heat of the spring in april everyone 's lives loosen and unravel and are slowly rebuilt to everyone 's satisfaction,0
nevertheless this movie is a must,1
emilio is very good in his part but his performance in this role is weak,1
ease is perfectly lovely and all anyone in alexandre 's position in an urban area can ask for,0
fred holywell scrooge 's nephew is an excellent example of this,0
magnificent,0
they make their own story and they have a great chemistry,1
then you get to see what else is happening around her,1
and of course he did design the bowie knife done to his specifications,0
bugs in the back yard,1
this movie easily can beat big budget hollywood productions like superman returns or xmen 3 the only thing i do have to mention is the lack of humor,0
she is held captive by a witch and leashed by an unbreakable chain,0
this film is the asian lord of the rings a high fantasy story based in actual chinese mythology,0
that 's the big theme of the movie and it involves some touching scenes but to be honest the film is n't that memorablebr br it 's still a fairly mild nice tale that i would be happy to recommend,0
really this film was really bad just a lot really crappy bad brad pitt'spiel,1
i loved that scene,0
she was in town for a few days during her honeymoon,1

he was just so very funny,1
well not totally like that lol,0
vosloo has obviously moved on from the typecasted mummy guy,0
what is the point of this movie,1
as if that were n't enough it 's funny,0
this movie is not worth wasting time watching or wasting even a minute on a rentalbr br 210,1
instead that is the one story i got,1
they are so cute and so natural with every facial movement they makebrigitta gives a real performance when she does nay,1
all in a time when everyone thought that it couldn't possibly have been anything but one movie this bad and even the most talented directors can find time in trying to do a great movie no matter how bad,1
810,0
the story line is predictable in its execution and the script lacks a good sense to build suspense or develop suspense,1
and as an aside i liked this film in another way and that is because it had a great plot,1
end of story but if its not enough to say that this is a movie where everything is a plot,1
under the rocks are the words and some of the words are theirs,0
the plot is about a middle aged man who decides he needs a new wife and son to keep the family in business,1
she is an overworked unappreciated administrative drudge who is invisible,0
hopefully that wouldn't be as painful to experience as seeing this thing,1
the actresses were great,0
audiences can readily identify with them,0
his look was a great cross between horrific and comedic goofball,0
first i thought the camerawork was a ripoff but then i got used it and started to like it,0
everyone seemed to have a different opinion on it though,1
first of all this film is set in greeca and the fact it're not made in greecs probably contributes less to the fact that it're so bad than in any other planet there really is n'much to make me laugh at it,1
having been on the receiving end when the car was stolen and being put down in such an unlikely manner i was expecting a very moving film and it was,1
in the end they do not understand that they would be in danger of going into this place and they take all the warnings they receive as their word and try and help them to escapebrilliance,1
hey who the heck is linda blake here but with a name you know it will be the same old old old same 'whoever said that i thought was n 'the james gatsby character was awful on the first viewing i thought this was funny,1
enterprise has much promise in this area as well,0
but as it turns out he 'll find out that the guy who kidnapped her is a guy he once was,1
his role is more than a little overthebar and he 'll make a very memorable character for fans of russ russ and kristen berkoff,1
i have been a fan since i first saw her in the movies perfect my favorite year dc cab and stardust memoriesbr br it 's so rare to see lee grant these days in anything,0
i saw a few minutes of jackass movie the other night and could n't believe how poorly put together it was everything just put in a line joke after joke with no relation between anything,0
one of the best episodes of this series and a good look at why harrison forsythe'sparkle in his sixties is not in it now,1
and will admit that i shed quite a few tears throughoutbr br on the whole not a movie that i would seek out to what however i am sure glad i did see it,0
a triumph,0
nonetheless it is an issue that fans have raised so it 's probably best to be warned beforehandbr br as nice as it would be to have lucas release the original versions of these three classic films he nonetheless stands by what he said about these revamps being the definitive editions of his classic trilogy and when viewing the star wars movies altogether as one complete saga it actually makes sense to keep them technically and aurally consistent,0
also the story is not as clever or entertaining,1
i have a large collection of his music on vinyl,0
both sides have a very different story,1
firsttime director tom kiesche turns in a winning film in the spirit of cutting dark comedy,0
then too the ending is bittersweet,0
the rest consists of scenes with mike and a few more to come but overall that is it,1
storywise i think all this is the best and if you haven't watched it yet please do so,1
the film follows the exploits of one of these brave heroes by his family,1
this series could have used a little work,1
furthermore trier uses socalled dutch angels and reinvents backgroundprojection by adding separately shot cooperating layers upon layers but unlike old hollywood movies that incorporated it for economical reasons trier uses it for artistic reasons,0
it was very good but i wouldn't have gone out of my house without a big box of this junkbr the only thing in this film was the bad actors and even the bad actors could're funny and the bad performances weren't,1
i highly recommend this film to anyone who loves true romances ones that go beyond superficial beauty to real love as one of the best films out there hindi or otherwise,0
whatever the reason i thought it was pitch perfect,0
lastly if this scene was still unbelievable to you how about in empire strikes back or in a new hope where there were several scenes of a group consisting of just han solo chewbacca and the princess being shot at by like ten stormtroopers and all their blasters missed while the heros were in full view,0
no one should ever ever watch it,1
disney has no way of explaining the story,1
brandon'shark attack the man in the dark is a rather strange film,1
of course he and olivia love to have fun while they do their thing,1
many of them seemed to have been inspired or had been influenced from films like the man with no arms or jaws,1
meanwhile her cousin peter takes off all his clothes,1
students from all backgrounds are encouraged to view the movie without being too impressed,1
the music is ok in the first scene of this picture however the acting was awful i really felt i was watching the worst acting in the world,1
what makes this movie stand out is that shows both sides of the war have good and bad people,0
it was great to be reminded that it was just as crazy for me back in my day as it is for teens today,0
she keeps the school rockin' and encourages her fellowstudents to join her in her jubilant anticsbr br meanwhile the school that riff attends has just hired a brandnew principal named ms togar,0
yes the action is slow but not the slowdestiny and yes the climax is great,1
unlike other horror fassbender films i can easily relate with a lot of these,1
nothing here can be compared with the quality of the rest,1
please make all 8 movies,0
the characters are interesting too and the script with some of herbert de nivola'situationatheepartcharadeshelpingplentyathenumbers plotlines as you know they come from and then move on to what you think will happen is a very well written show,1
congrats to all who made this effortbr br this would rank among the funniest films ever but what was itbr br i think i might be getting stuck on the edge of the seat a little more in the past 12 years and i'm thinking oh man,1
but eventually mcintire comes to them but not to collect stewart andor his fine that he supposedly owes to the government,0
but it is a real rollercoaster ride and if you do n't look too closely it is all quite believable,0
it gets a little bit long in the beginning which is a good sign since there is no climax here,1
the color purple at the time was considered risky especially after action classics like jaws and raiders of the lost ark,0
it 'll only be for 2 hours and i still do not understand why this movie has n been shown to the public,1
she was excellent in the show,0
instead you get this a bunch a lot of stupid and pointless characters,1
he likes castles gothic atmospheres and stylish murders too which is fine by me,0
maybe the filmmakers were hoping to make a point about why alexander roos was a little weird at first to start with but he was a true star,1
in response to this i think to a certain degree this is a correct analysis however considering this is a barjatya film i think that compared to mpk hahk hssh and mpkdh it has been toned down significantly,0
as a part insomniac myself i can relate with how the story develops,0
too bad the producers failed in making him a believable character,1
thirdly i did not find the film to be even remotely difficult to follow or confusing in any way,0
and the plot is full to the bone and the acting was a joke,1
br br in the meantime jeff agrees to ride point for ronda up to dawson in order to deliver supplies,0
because wow what a performance by busy phillips and erkia christensen not to mention the rest of the cast,0
as a matter an actor'ssssss'ss,1
the film begins with vincent price about to begin his performance as a magician,0
br br what i do n't see is why everyone has such a problem with deanna 's choice of drug in the attempt of suicide scene from the comments made you sound like it was the actresses choice and her stupid choice,0
everything about it is spot onthe clothes the music and most importantly the dancing,0
her character is also played by a very interesting jessica simmons,1
naturally the spanish have repossessed albniz and in iberia the performers reinterpret his compositions in terms of various more ethnic and regional dances and styles,0
but this does have shortcomings the ones the first part had and more,0
the movie has some nice photography and some cool characters,1
she was on top of the game creating neurotic pudgy and lovable panda with a jewish streak in her,0
i particularly liked the special effects on the chess board as alternative plays are anticipatedbr br through the feminist director maureen gorris emily watson with her big blue eyes gradually strengthens via her transformative relationship with john turturro 's fairly onenote absentminded intense chess geniusbr br the settings in italy and hungary are beautifulbr br,0
spielberg was very good in this the best of the bad guys and mitchum was really good in the first moviebrad pitt did a really great job as the evil jason,1
it 'll never stop that from happening to me,1
right from the beginning i became consumed with the movie getting more and more excited with each minute passing,0
thank heavens there won't be a remake in years,1
we learn that jim bowie was in the person of santa ana fighting his own brotherinlaw,0
the story goes on and upon watching it you can relate in some way with the characters,1
at a different location he becomes a part as a reporter on the local news station,1
needless to state that vincent price remains the absolute most essential element of triumph in this film as well as from nearly every other horror movie this legendary man ever starred in,0
nothing appears rushed unlike hero,0
the casting adds to its perfection,0
being that this movie has a lot of fine entertainment qualities i think it should some more credit than it has been given on imdbbr br it 's your basic 'who done it',0
belgian cinema is very difficult and difficult to get into,1
not only is the premise of the story about love and family betrayal and the need to stay alive in the real world but the way they are portrayed here is so realistic and authentic,1
this felt a little rushed and i think if the movie had been a bit longer they could have done the characters a little better justicebr br dialogue i give this component 10 points,0
once upon a time in a castle two little girls are playing in the garden 's castle,0

lothario denis waterman is learning to accept his role as grandfather,0

this one is an interesting one but has few redeeming featuresbronson never really gives the movie any depth,1
the first five of these films were pretty bad but by the end of this one was worth the effort to watchbrained boring,1
among the many scenes that i would highly not hesitate commenting about the rest of the movie is when the killer kidnasses a girl and then tells him he was the one responsible to get him all those people,1
the way the story is set up is excellent although the dialogues often don't do anything to enhance the story or make it compelling,1
frankly i have no idea what the producers could possibly come up with for this kindof film,1
hope davis appears only in a couple of scenes leaving us to lament why did n't she stay longer,0
how can someone be remembered as both patton and scrooge,0
who are they making this movie about,1

devosaudiard manage carla 's deafness and its attendant warped inner world with discreet stylish flairbr br in this film audiard is already clearly in control of his handling on tension action and investing his frame with a truly visceral experience which will become the great hit a prophet of nine years later,0
who would put into such a low budget the story and the production and if for no reason they do make you wonder why,1
as the film progresses it seems to get much worse,1
two songs stood out for me mujhe haq hai do anjaane,0
however this is not to say that it is a totally worthless entry in the series,0
the tape is old and picture quality is pretty good but fading the sound is not as good as the cd,0
stars,0
amanda bynes is just terrible in this film,1
the songs are a mixed bag with the title song april love being the best of them,0
you just have to take what it gives you enjoy the movie and enjoy the ride,0
this is an incredibly funny bong film starring james dean dave gregory as jack baxter,1
everything else about the movie is good at the expense of everything other than the plot,1
in the early 70ies she seemed like a natural to appear in the series and the result is a rather bland film that 'll appeal to the 'low budgeters of the city,1
his acting is so terrible that it makes me cringe in disgust,1
it is about the goodness that still persists and that keeps the world running,0
although she has been in another movies she is most memorable in this one,0
there're no plot twists to speak of and it're just a bunch,1
ed harris is no jane fenton and his character is not a big hit in the film and is very wooden in her role herebrittani is wasted on the part of her role she lacks a great personality yet has a lot to be desired in her rolebr br this movie is a disappointment,1

dale midkiff has the ways to pull off this characterbr br this movie kept me spellbound from start to finishbr br the death of missie willies baby girl with the timing of clarks visit was only gods timing,0

it gives a sadness and a tear,0
subsequently as he sees the train approaching a giant bridge he runs at breakneck speed to board the train and stop the clock,0
the third a power status hungry doctor with a desire for recognition and three ex 'sbr br they are almost the first wives club and indeed there is much verbal bashing of ex 's involved as well as some he left the credit card behaviour,0
he is helping all the students to recover from the event but alicia does n't seem to care,0
however it seems that they made a lot of money but had very little to do with the moviebr br this movie would have been much better off dead and buried with the same cast and crew and some less known actors which is what a lot of fans complain about all too so i have to say i really like this film i can honestly say i saw some pretty good stuff in it and thought it was worth a watchbr br i love this movie it was a good film a few scenes were very funny i liked the music,1
roger corman '99 isn't in it for the first 20 minutes of the movie but his acting is superb,1
fine,1
in the meantime there is the chance for a moonlight underwear swim for a bunch of pretty young things and for joan to do a couple of risque dance numbers br br but none of this is supposed to be taken seriously it 's all good fun from those wonderful precode days when hollywood was really naughty,0
goldie hawn and chris sarandon were the best two in it,0
but this movie was made in one of the most chauvinistic european countries ever and i'm sure that most french would rather drop dead than to admit that their movies have been inspired by an englishman,0
over the years it've become my personal favourite comedy of late,1
experimental music by the composer harry harris and some very interesting shots of the countryside in the summer heat,1
thought was poured over what was loved and hated about this film and while the loves overpowered it was the elements that were hated that sparked further debate within my mind,0

they are joined by an unlikely pair of ladies one caroline dester played by the enigmatic polly walker who resembles a very vamp louise brooks and mrs fisher,0
grady brat is a young american who has a family in africa,1
of course given that this movie was made after a new hope and the empire strikes back it probably should n't be so surprising that the special effects have reached an even greater level of excellence,0
one of his best performances is nelson who comes off almost as his father played brilliantly here,1
continuity is only a problem if you are forever scrutinising shows and are obsessed with the tiniest of details,0
though he did do a great job he couldn't even keep a straight face during the film,1
instead of going on to get the girl and finding out just how bad the situation turned into a great thing it ended with a happy and healthy end,1
however i ca n't remember another film where my rating has changed as drastically as it has for valentine,0
they make fun of them and they do nuff said,1
it has to be said he ca n're pretty bad if i were him,1
the only problem is that there are more good and bad actors playing characters that were n 'not there when the film startedbrrr br the story line is really bad,1
hence the mother and whore is the same person,0
it've been a couple and it've all come across well as a long weekend so it 'll be a good time to have some funbr br there are lots and lots of twists,1
they drive their cabs and are also desperate for love,0
br br but as for me i thought the film was so funny and i love it,1
they were such a cute couple,0
the patient and unassuming viewer will be thoroughly rewarded in ways most other films could dream,0
in many ways it've been similar to the 'the exorcist series for sure and the fact of this has to do with the fact they were filmed in los alamot,1
i'm stunt i must admit i never saw a movie with such good story and none stop high special effect martial art fighting scene,0
in jedi on the other hand even the rebels look like they just stepped out of a shower and had their uniforms dry cleaned,0
and the trial itself imo is the least interesting portion of this fascinating fantasybr br david niven and kim hunter are wonderfully cast as the young lovers but it 's roger livesey who gives the liveliest and most credible performance,0
as the song is being played we get a shot of the american soldiers listening to it several of them nod their heads to the rhythm perfectly at home,0
however i 'd probably be a little uneasy taking young kids to see it without giving them some sort of preshow briefing andor postshow debriefing about the violence and other off color stuff or i 'd wait till they 're older to show it to them,0
in a rare event the series did n not end as it did in this show,1
this is probably the worst i have seen in ages,1
despite the low budget i have to say that this film is still worth seeing in a class of its time with good acting and a good story,1
of course we can see her in a couple nude scenes in this film and that're pretty disturbing stuff that you'ren't supposed to noticebray did it,1
although i think the idea of ewoks overpowering stormtroopers is a bit farfetched it did n't seem very unrealistic since they were more of a distraction that the rebels could use rather than an actual threat to the stormtroopers although they did have some luck fighting them,0
and also wins the heart of young comic actor william hainesbr br she does get her first big break but it does n't come for haines as well and marion does get to do legitimate drama with actor paul ralli playing andre telfair a pretend no account count of avignon,0
i highly recommend it to only fans ofbr br 1 the horror genrebr br orbr br 2 an actor or actress featured in itbr br out of starsbr br ps i am sick and tired of people comparing this and other modern horror movies with scream,0
both do,1
the main male character is a bit irritating as we follow the main guy in various activities,1
in fact the music is so good i could take up to ten minutes on its own,1
first of all it is quite linear so when your mission says for example go to that room all the doors in the house will be locked apart from those that lead to the room of your mission this may save time but it restricts your liberty of explorationsecondly the fact all the weapons are antiques may not appeal to most fps players who are used to high tech weaponry,0
to me it seemed like rotj was the best because it had the most profound plot the most suspense surprises most emotional and definitely the most episodic movie,0
randomly he 'll find someone of the same name who might not share a common sense or if he is unlucky enough to be in the wrong area will fall into his trap,1
one of the defendants chris david gulpili begin to somehow invades david 's dreams as if he want 's to tell him what was really behind billy 's deathbr br david at first not taking his dreams of chris seriously begins to sense that their real when he meet him at the courthouse,0
each and everyone of the characters is extremely well portrayed and everyone was very likiable to usbrigitte lombardi in this movie is an excellent actor and this movie proves that,1
every time he takes off his mask the black hole appears,1
this is a terrific cast and the directing is great,1
not in my opinion he 'll ever be an outstanding film maker but he is still a very talented director,1
this could be his most controversial film ever and if so that is nigh incredible,1
this does nada,1
even the first episode is a bit cheesy and pointless,1
despite their completely different personalities and julian 's crude and insensible remarks they become friends,0
two days before the movie premiere i went to see his concert,0
there is no humor to go around with this moviebr br there is a plot in this movie but it just isn't there to have any laughs or suspense,1
in my book it is one of the best 100 movies ever made in bollywood,0
the music is wonderful and the cinematographer is a very underrated directorbruno matteti,1
i love having a movie i can watch with them where men have integrity and character,0
one is a reclusive sexually repressed patient,0
el mar is a tough stark utterly brilliant brave work of cinematic art,0
good special effects may be scary for the little ones,0
not only that but the whole plot is a total joke,1
in a way the film is the ultimate selfdestruct movie,1
this film is one of the best shorts i 've ever seen and as i make it a point to be at all the major film festivals i 've seen a lot especially of what the industry considers the best,0
the cast of characters seems to be very realistic,1
he is a bad dude but he is the most charismatic and likability guy i've ever seen in a film,1
since he didn't kill someone at the end he just wanted someone to kill him without even bothering to tell me who,1
cast i give this component 10 points,0
this was just terrible,1
the character'samoa'was not really likeful either,1
i loved her in this movie,0
you have but to look into watson 's eyes to know that the feelings she 's conveying are real,0
tonally it wasn't as strong,1
the main actor has a bad day and i've seen him in some crappy movies over the years,1
the ending is not just a bit unbelievable the plot is absolutely unbelievable,1
and the fact the people do not know who is playing is what made these film good,1
we see in his face not only his frustration but his pain at scrooge 's selfimposed separation from his only living relative,0
the idea with the dvd release of the new film of pablo 'the demon man 3 is very compelling in the extreme but in this version we get to see the story from a different perspective,1
the scenery is of the putyoureyeout variety the vintage costumes are gorgeous and the cinematography is deserving of much applause,0
along the way we also learn things about ourselves and our lives,0
definitely one of my desert island filmsbr br enter,0
when i heard the title of the film i thought it was going to be different perhaps in not such a good waybr br but i was wrong,0
so you know the expected audience right,0

the story is well written and the actors were well cast,1
growth of a young artist who becomes the face for a new generation of people with the need for social and political understanding is something people do not normally have,1
we have videos of many of redford s movies and we have watched a river runs through it many times,0
it not only explains the enormous difficulties those people have to cope wither but that even love is sometimes not enough,0
by teaching him to read and write she gives him access to the world of knowledge also traditionally gendered malebr br literacy here is used as a metaphor for the public realm and the systems of circulation that enable participation in the public realm,0
and when he does it 'll be worth the price of admission,1
then the father quits his job at the law firm,0
seagaled and in need of a quick shower she is told by the nurse her sister and a young girl she knows are in danger,1
he did it,1
the whole cast is so bad and not only that there are too few laughs,1
its main character julian played with an unusual mix of charm and unbalance by brosnan is not your typical hero,0
the film is more of a horrorthrillers sort as the film is mostly confined from one area at a single screen,1
the way he've portrayed all the other characters is just ridiculous i really wish there're more movies like this he really was and he was the one that put us here,1
but that're not all,1
we all knew the party girl the one they whispered about with tales of not only her sad home life but of her notorious exploits,0
the major issues are dealt with and this movie makes a major statement about how all of us adults feel after such major incidents,0
hamill surprises as the more wisened luke making his character 's progression from whiny teenager impatient student to enlightened warrior one of the few real character developments of the series,0

little do they know that a most ingenious trap has been laid for them and the emperor palpatine himself is personally overseeing the construction of the second death starbr br return of the jedi is my favorite of the original trilogy,0
after watching this movie at least you do n't get a headache from all the loud overrated music or any violence its just the truth it teaches about love and of course caring for the person you love throughout life i think it was an amazing movie kids can watch it without a doubt and adults will enjoy the simplicity that used to be india 's sure profoundness until all these rap hits miniskirts and skin showing became a part of it,0
as it is it still demands attention as a sweet moving small film,0
brat this time this is just another americano war movie with bad acting and bad dialogue and that're about the only reason i rented the movie,1
her reactions are spoton in this film,0
the only interesting part was the very poor dialog,1
firstly the movie does nve really well acting especially from a very poor rick baxter and matthew dillon,1
it is hard to make sense what happened and what was meant,1
i would have to say it was worth the effort,0
so what'starts out as some rather silly plot is really a clever one and the film'stirps a little more atmosphere which adds to its sense of surrealism,1
blue is not a sequel at all,0
spoiler alert the evil queen returns as a young girl,1
the whole movie was shot in a sort of jerry learystyle of a crossfire between a scowling linda russo and a raucous aufklug but hey that was how it could have beenbrigitte fosselini'ssochel'she 'll be in her 20'ssochest to die for as far you go she was only in the 50 and not worth a whole lot,1
with the usual setpieces and clich ridden dialogue of the early '60'si the movie does a very decent job in making you realize how great this movie really felt,1
there're also a lot of jokes in this film that are so bad they could make any film ever made in the historysthe way the main character is dressed is absolutely brilliantthe way he speaks with his words is so weird as if they were spoken to someone and someone was just having a laughbrayden is the very worst character in film history,1
together they are going through the motions on the film 'emotionality of italian life,1
the 2 lead actresses each give great emotional performances that really draw you in to the story and especially the characters,0
this movie is not a masterpiece but it is an example that you must give movies of this kind before they become garbage,1
norman starts getting his life on track finding love and career but paul continues to slide,0
annie is the wild child who lives for the next party or pill,0
growing up is n't easy sometimes we got to explore life how it is,0
the film makes no apologies for its treatment and i am afraid they are too,1
the plot could have more holes but hey this seems very real,1
worth it,1
this is simply not in the movie,1
but the junior brother is losing his grip,0
he was excellent the most enjoyable part of the film,0
instead the makers tried their best to make this piece of crap seem believable but did you know that the lead singer was a girl,1
this is not a horror film,1
i laughed so hard at that one scene where septimus comes on the ship oh my god wow,0
there are a lot of elements that take undying to the level of the best classic horror movies ever produced,0
the ending is a little sad but not at all like many other movies i see,1
technicians are called in to solve an issue that seems to no one in this movie,1
especially those who have been affected by any school shootingbr br it truly is one of the greatest movies of all time,0
personally i wouldn't say much about this movie it is basically a movie about an americancestrian,1
the film is a combination story of human nature friendship and fear,1
but in the end she is emptyhanded toni has disappeared with a man and her supposed mum turns out to be a sick woman,0
he was an excellent film actor as he shows us in this movie,0
it has so little dialogue it is painful to listen to,1
the acting is very poor,1
many other characters get introduced too and they remain pretty clear all the time if the viewer really concentrates on the film and its plot so i cannot say the film is confusing as it could be much worse especially in hong kong,0
we 'll miss you and you will miss us,1
as i drove from skagway alaska to dawson cityyukon a couple of years ago and was impressed with the scenery i cannot help but wish that this film even though it has beautiful color and scenic views would have been shot in the actual location,0
when i saw the elaborate dvd box for this and the dreadful red queen figurine i felt certain i was in for a big disappointment but surprise surprise i loved it,0
they could nate the kids for a few years but no one could have given them a real chance so they could have had a chance to make a better and more realistic film,1
not just because the story is good it 'll work in it 'cause it can go anywhere,1
the most interesting part of these parts is that the director and writer took themselves seriously and took the audience around them with their heart,1
this film is definitely one of my absolute favorites but as a film it fails at all points in its attempt to be unique and intriguingbragga've also had to work with a bunch other bad film makers who tried so hard to be original and original i don't really know why,1
and this is a great rock'n'roll movie in itself,0
talent is nigh on impossible to find here,1
who are they when their lives and their hopes and dreams need the help of these two girls,1
someone says that this is not a good film but as the scene develops you realize what to make for yourself,1
there is a deep dark side of this film despite there is a good ending,0
one more thing i have to say that in a short story it gives your eye an idea as it moves along and it doesn't make you look back for a moment like i did,1
postscript the scenes with leia in the slave bikini are memorable,0
this episode has so little action the film is basically a waste a cheap tv movie you want it anyway and it 'll blow the movie away even if you do manage a bit of realism,1
and for those who think certain things could n't happen in a hospital you 're dead wrong on that too i 've been there,0
the first half of their film makes me think and the rest is filled with bad jokes,1
the use of colors in this movie is something very different in today 's film world where every other movie has the payback blue filter,0
it 's not trying to show off the latest cgi techniques nor did it offend my intelligence with dimwitted dialogs and story lines that are simple enough i could 've figured them out in 3rd grade,0
then he is caught by robert 'the man from the castle who was on the list of people who made it into the top 250 of the list,1

pop the corn pop in the tape and get ready to go back more than three quarters of a century in movie making history,0

their grandfather is a mariner of sorts,0
seeing this very beautiful film sharpens my complaint that virtually none of the films of saura are available on dvd in the usa,0

what he wants in himself is to create new ones in his life and not just make them into some random messiah,1
he is more of another guy than he actually was an actor,1
johnny leung plays jane and her sister kim are good,1
speaking of the movie it was not as bad as i initially saw it made me laugh,1
at first i thought that it could go wrong but finally i figured out in the end they had to make a good movie and i am not disappointedbrilliance was a definite must and i highly encourage anyone looking for good films with good characters and an interesting story to watch this one,1

we will be reading the books now that we are hooked,0
watching jean pierre leaud 's character at work is exactly like watching what goes on in real life when guys like that destroy the lives of our female friends,0
my favorite segment of the whole movie is at first when the bad guy uses the camera he just pulls on his shirt to grab and get away the last ten bullets and then he fires an automatic weapon which is the real gun,1
so many people have seen this film and just do n't get it and i do n't understand why,0

the two are good too,1
it reminded me of battleship potemkin that intense constant style coupled with the spray of red to convey tons of horror without much gore,0
other standout parts this time are sren pilmarks doctor krogshoj who must face the horrible revenge of dr helmer and once again patient mrs drusse tries to solve the mysteries miss marplestyle,0

he steals the movie with his toughness and soon we learn an undercover secret that will leave audiences on the floor with laughter,0
my guess is that the director is still trying to figure out who will die and how,1
for a danish movie i have to say that this is very good moviebr br it 's in a class of its own yet it has an international potentialbr br the movie has a big budget and is starring famous danish actors and a few newcomers who play very well,0
the problem with this film if one watches it is its slow pacing and lack of any real tension,1
he adds more comedy to the character which works brilliantly,0
since the australian government will not prosecute tribal aborigines leaving any justice to be done by the tribes themselves,0
that said the poirot mysteries vary in quality but not as much as reviewers and raters would have you believe,0
but even if you 're not into the ramones or punk rock this movie is a terrific blast of energetic fun,0
br br a sexy female cast is always appreciated especially in a giallo and this one is a prime example for that,0
no there is another br br because every star wars fan had to have an opinion about i ii iii and because that opinion was biased since we missed so much the atmosphere and the characters of the original trilogy i will state the good points of the return of the jedi and a few corresponding bad points of the prequel,0
at any rate this teaming was in many ways the best of the betty boop try out pictures,0
do n't miss it,0
and yes there is a very good and moving sequence featuring a really good score by john goodman and a wonderful film score by dave macy and gwyneth paltrow,1
it 'll take you 10 second for nothing to make this movie any fun,1
one of the reasons was the cast,1
and yes there 's also john williams' musicbr br all told while return of the jedi falters a little bit in the middle the first and third acts deliver in style making this a rather satisfactory finale to one of the greatest sagas everbr br in 1997 george lucas rereleased the classic star wars in digitally restored special editions which featured addedin effects andor shots as well as some enhancements,0
anyway clubhouse is worth a look because jeremy sumpter gives the main character a kind of likability and naivet that is appealing without being overly sweet and cuddly,0
yesterday i caught this movie again on tv so i looked at it a bit deeper,0
the fact that a group from the us couldn't find a decent cast to play the main role should have been an embarrassment to the team,1

also he has no choice but give in and leave,1
but the italian version containing all the footage is still the one to look for of coursebr br a convincing giallo with obligatory twists and red herrings la dama rossa uccide sette volte is highly recommended to giallo fans and slightly superior to miraglia 's above mentioned other thriller,0

and there are the obvious errors,1

with one major sense disabled we see carla 's heightened intuitive power to compensate,0
and she should take an interest with the big boys,1
he 'll probably win the oscars and go straight to stardown,1
that 'depere is a poor attempt at a western,1
it is a great example for what can be taken or left out of film,1
by exploring our imagination we shape our own futures,0
and it was one i never dreamed i would see,1
and when the girl says in the final scene she 'll never stop thinking about the big dream and the girl says in no uncertain terms she must have told the man she loves to marry his own mother which i think to be the last line that i have spoken,1

the last two segments were quite welldone so i will give the rest of the film credit for some of the performances in the first part,1
but i had n't seen her silent comedies and this film is wonderful,0
all in all this movie is one of the best indepth looks at the life of a chess grandmaster and turturro and watson add a whole nonmainstream noncliche feel to the film,0
overall i recommend this movie for children and adults who are a child at heart,0
seem to be about all that the filmmakers need and most of the actors seem tired of sitting around,1
i guess when beat street made a national appearance flashdance came at the same time,0
the only problem i had was the fact i could nudge my nose at the tv,1
but the ending is totally predictable and it 'll take any fan of the series of characters of the original one to make it through to its conclusion,1
they do in this film but in other films they do in this movie,1
however it 'll turn out that he is right,1

it is a good movie to see if your a serious movie buff,1
naomi is the mother and i just had to see the two of them againbruno de la mamalo comes in second in the worst actress cast at the academy awards,1
in addition the acting is superb and the use of english and american actors quite astounding,0
for me this movie fit like a glove,0
at the end of the movie the movie was about a girl who runs away from home and then finds a man for her,1
nevertheless and i ca n't put my finger on it exactly i did enjoy this very much,0
br br this movie has the best tiny tim by far,0
kinnear holds his own opposite brosnan 's performance and injects danny white with his effortless everyman charm,0
i wish she was in more films and better ones than she generally is,0
no real scares,1
the cast is excellent to look out for especially dylan olivio who plays the lead rolebrilliantly directed the script is very well crafted as the dialogue is also very strong the actors deliver the best lines and performances are great,1

yes this can be easily forgotten if you get the chance to watch it because there are so few movies of the genre that can be categorized with this term,1
the nx01 enterprise is the perfect vessel to show the beginnings of what many people have come to lovebr br scott bakula was just superior as captain jonathan archer,0

the whole film is just boring and not worth watching,1
it 'll help if you have some other friends you can talk about and do stuff along the lines that could be done over and done well in the moviebr,1
and the movie has it all it 'll have you laughing because you will still find yourself giggled,1

that said i loved the ending very closely from the beginning and i thought it was a wonderful ending,1
many people would enjoy this masterpiece if it had at list the english subtitles,0

i will probably watch this movie a third time over the weekend just so i can watch and relive the traditions we all grew up with,0
yes it 'll be a hard slog for a while even after its initial release but in my humble judgment this doesn't ruin the film in the way you would expect,1
it also comes off a bit too similar to the old brit film,1
this film is very good not only as directed directed by the director but as written which makes this one of his best ever,1
and there are very few in the genre,1
from the beginning to the end the filmmakers tried to create tension in the story,1
my mind was changed by elizbeth von arnim 's original book,0
as usual the movie isn't very scary but the horror scenes are really good,1
in any case take a look at it,0
the plot itself is quite interesting and i would say this is one that can hold its own against many other films of the period and i haven't read much of their material in the years since,1
this movie also showed how good and interesting real people can be,1
the best movie for those who want a serious thought provoking movie to enjoy,1
creative story line with a very talented cast,0
but the real power in the film is the novel by neil gaiman and the script made from his creative and fertile mind,0
this is a feelgood movie and nothing more,0

at this point alex was willing to get a job and and help raise their child before he found out gilberte had aborted it and planned to marry someone else,0

the way he did a film like this is the best that can be done about cinema,1
an edgy stylish and exciting drama that received no promotion and was sent straight to vhs and cable tvwhere i first saw it,0
we are then faced by a story that is really good and a story we all love,1
connor trinneer plays commander charles trip tucker who always adds charm and comedic style to his character and finally linda park as ensign hoshi sato who often plays a weaker character but thankfully quickly becomes interesting,0
as the lines above may suggest vincent price is my favorite actor and while i personally would not allow myself to miss anything the man has been in none of my fellow fans of the man may miss this little gembr br price stars as don galico an underrated master magician and inventor of magic devices whose boss a sleazy businessman stole his wife from him,0
not only does the story take place in modern times but also we find themselves in the middle of such a time when war and war 'are on and the peace is being threatenedbr br it'stays in tune throughout and we are in constant suspense as the people fight to get what they wantbr br not only is this movie well cast but it contains lots and plenty characters,1

keaton plays a detective in the film who is given an extremely difficult task by a local gang,1
everyone else seemed to do well,1
however after watching it it'stalesbr br the movie does n've a reasonable pace but it leaves a lot to ponder and does n'realittle justice that 'the killer isn't a serial killer,1
there are some great action sequences that are very satisfying for the first 45 minutes or so and then a rather slow and uneventive final scene that takes itself way,1
i have to give at least 910 stars for this,0
the only bum note is a subplot concerning the missing wife of paul 's parole officer a device that seems contrived only to help steer the main thrust of the story into a neat little feelgood culdesacbr br it was the french 'new wave' of the 60 's that first introduced the concept of 'genre' to film making and i 've always felt that any medium is somewhat compromised when you have to use a system of labels to help define it so it 's always a pleasure to discover a film that seems to transcend genre or better still defy it,0
the whole film is about a mother who is having issues with a man who she is dealing out of her own personal and professional sense and she does nned the part but is now in a position in which she has to deal with more than her husband and his friends,1
there presence however is either obtrusive or irrelevant with hastings,0

this movie rejuvenates the values that we forgot,0
the chief threat to their love is kiki 's brother and her difficulty in trying to severe her relation to him,0
there're a million ways in this movie and they can be put together or if you're interested try something elsebr br the characters in this are all likably likible but when the plot turns to one of the most despicable acts of evil one 'll have a pretty hard time understanding why a group of young males would do such a thing,1

he is a great actor,1
morgan is an old college girl living in a very empty apartment on the east side,1
because of the success of very british comedies of manners situated at the end or beginning of the twentieth century most notably adaptations of e m forster novels this very merchantivory like production was received in the light it brought when it was released in 1992 it was an exceptional year for actress miranda richardson having appeared as the wife of jeremy irons who discovers her husband has been having an affair in the worst possible way in damage and as the ira terrorist who eventually dons a wig and gets a nasty comeuppance in the crying game,0
by now you've probably learned most or less all that you learned about the movie,1
my guess it will find big success on video,0
there is also udo kier the tremendous actor who blew me away in von trier 's shocking second film epidemic though here he is mere scenerybr br another guest at the house is eddie constantine an actor with a quiet strength playing a somber american intelligence man,0

instead i had to really control myself in order to convince her that i was not scared,0
and she is not a bad actress when it comes to acting but she is not quite as convincing as he 'll like to admit she was in the first couple of films,1
does nada really deserve such praise,1

there is plenty happening but it is up to you to connect the pieces,0
we 've become very sophisticated according to the media as far as what we watch or not,0
enterprise is fantastic,0
the we 're having a baby number was shortened as well but other than that it was practically dead on,0
i think the weighted average for this film is too low,0
i can identify with the characters and the situations they live i like reality,0
needless to state this film could have been better served had the characters not tried so very to be more,1
well i should point out here that no one is really sure what to say but what is clear is that this movie does not have such an obvious plot,1
yet i remember it pretty well with a nice twist or two and an interesting ambiance on a windmill farm,0
the movie has little in common with a hong kong soap,1
overall you will need to watch the whole movie for all the action,1

if you like those old and tired classics check out this one,1
george c scott plays a convincing and mean ebenezer scrooge and the actors playing the ghosts are rather frightening and menacing,0
in the late 80 '90'seventh sense the film was a mess it 'll take you till the wee hours but for a few hours it was worth the effort to see it,1
the color purple is at times hard to follow and on one or more occasions tends to be a little erratic in regard to time frame,0
at first one of my favorites the scene with robert roman as the young boy who is bullied by the school bully jerry leahins,1
she 'deserves to be called up in a movie of all time,1
it sounds misconceived but the connection is soon made lucid with the events that followbr br clocking in at nearly 5 minutes the rapidfire exchange between british pilot peter and american radio contact june is breathtaking in its intimacy,0
one of the funniest scenes is when the woman and her son are in the kitchen playing with a bowl of soup,1
both were very believable and in their way funny especially the part about the father of the girl in the wheelchair,1
how any of the others relate i have no idea making an even more interesting coincidencebr br,0
i liked the quick sexual encounter which must be out of character for a normally reserved school teacher,0
many others have pointed out that mary jolene fonda does not seem quite as innocent as her husband,1
and why is hollywood so obsessed when it comes down to acting talent and skill,1
the problem though is not that the film fails to offer much in terms of comedybr br the film lacks any real drama and it has little to offer other than to provide one too many stupid and uninteresting comments about everything,1
the way the characters talked in the movie was very funny,1
madeline zima was decent if not overly memorable as the teenaged lucybr br vivian vance and william frawley were not featured much thankfully since rebecca hobbs and russell newman were not very convincing in the roles,0
a great movie rather challenging than really entertaining,0
the revelation comes totally unnecessary ruining the logical climax the movie could have had,0
the third follows their european tour,0
again the best part of the film is the music and sound effects,1
those of the average joana fan,1
still he just seems like an overthetop hack and his voice is the only real strength in this film and the script is just plain stupid,1
first off i have to say that the first movie was sooo good it was so funny it was awesomebrat then they changed the ending so it would never work again it would be boring and if you had the courage to watch it i bet you've seen some of the funnies in the film and still think they are goodbr br also i would love for everyone to see another movie with tom robinson playing his character tom robinson because i think he 'll be awesomebrats all the girls in this film like jane austin and all the chicks at the endbr br the story is not bad it just has to,1
though we do not know for certain what is real and what is a dream he comes face to face with his deepest fears in a haunting climax that will leave you pondering its meaning into the wee hours of the morningbr br in this period of history in which native hopi and mayan prophecies predict the end of history and the purification of man leading to the fifth world the last wave though 25 years old is still timely,0
we find jerry and mary have a relationship,1
its not just a waste the music and story are just downright awful and the story gets to be so ridiculous that you feel compelled to walk out and tell someone what you feel and then go out,1
nononsense detective blyde tully who leads the lead on a mission to solve a major murder by solving a crime that he is aware is still a mysterybr br this film was in its low budget and is extremely poor special effects,1
it 'll be a lot easier to see this after the 2nd viewing,1
br br other jarring changes would include the need for reduced average seconds for cutting and the inevitable plea to shorten dialogue so it can preserve the low attention spans of most audiences,0
music was ok but only in the thirdbrilliant ending where everyone died with a single shot br br the main message is that we shouldn't accept that we haven't lived to tell the truth,1
what ends the film is a gunsblazing furious show of good against evil and a genuinely feelgood feeling that everything will be alright,0
when will his friend the killer come along to kill them,1
she seems to have a few coming up so i 'll keep my fingers crossed,0
as the song from whom the films takes its title the film makes the impossible true and tries to make us aware that noone is able to judge anybody all this with the lightness of a comedy and the timing of a masterful direction,0
because i'm a huge fan of the japanamerican movie genre i had to make such an attempt to catch japan in one scene after another but i found it annoying and forced,1
accompanied by a great rock soundtrack featuring some of the ramones best songs this film allows a viewer to accept a time in life when war did n't dominate headlines and people just had a good time,0
the two girls got to a casting,0
this could have been a very good film but i thought the dialogue was just way out of context,1
the only reason they bothered renting this movie was to add to its awfulness,1
the last wave is never going to win over the mainstream audience,0
the dialogue is so good and it makes you feel sorry for you,1
the dialogue is simply unbelievable,1
it was very entertaining and interesting,1
vadar it seemed had won the day,0
the special edition dvd sleeve is a wonderful addition,1
moments are thrown in with no explanation whatsoever,1

and why did they sound like supersonic planes in the battle through the sky in the end,0
max von sydow provides his great voice as the narratorbr br a one of a kind movie,0
in short i think that this is a great episode to watch over andover again and i think that the series will live on and grow in depth and in fact my personal opinion about the series i think that it is a good addition to the canon of tv 'films,1
maybe they will make one someday so we may all remember these two brothers,1
plus a great performance from udo kier in a more substantial role,0

once i arrived early for one in a series of mostly antoine doinel truffaut films,0
but that is how it ends the story is a boring messbr br in all honesty this movie should have been a better effort if not for the bad bad writing direction and direction of burt lancet,1
would love to hear how he did itbr br for those who enjoy the movie the characters were very believable too,1
i'm very disappointed that it was cancelled,0
well i had seen they all laughed when it came out inbr br europe around 1982 and had kept a vague but dear souvenir of it,0
i managed to catch some recordings of it at least and of course purchased the recently released dvd of the complete series,0
all i ca not believe the whole people that made that movie were trying to make a movie,1
equally it shows how our memory deceives us a 100 accurate reconstruction is a lie,0
another factor is that poonam chichi is really mean to her and you feel sorry for poonam because she has been treated bad and makes you want to see her happy and when she finally finds happiness you too start feeling happy with her the movie basically makes you fall in love with poonam more then just prem,0
12 out of 10,1

that is a great villain,0
he discovers the fallen star has taken the form of a beautiful girl yvaine,0
in a way this film has inspired me to go into the theatre to get some drinks,1
a society in which there is no dissent or challenge to authority is crazier and more dangerous than any bushrangerbr br so not expecting this to be an accurate recreation of the historical kelly gang i actually found it a surprisingly unencumbered and refreshing movie,0
being of course it is not in the vein of the classic slater movies and the story is different and this film is much more sophisticated,1
ricky gervais is an added extras,0
much like his first film the element of crime von trier uses the perspective of the main character to draw us into his world and much like element the film begins with the main character being hypnotized,0
in french with easy to read subtitles and good translation,0
actually while the new films are inferior to the original films they are good for one reason only,0
agent dennis gerald is the first suspect that goes missing in a huge bust in los angeles,1
this isn't a bad thing and i believe i am going to give the movie an a,1
hope davis has a small but subtly effective supporting role as kinnear 's wife who happens to get a little excited when she has a facilitator in her living roombr br the visuals and settings are perfect including a bullfight racetrack and denver suburb,0
the movie is like a big brother film set in the '70si era with all the clich 'thugs in the audience 'getting the girl 'ing over and putting her on,1
it've been a couple of years since i've watched it but i'm still glad i do,1
other than that it 'll be a good way for one of the greatest films of the 80 'til the final countdown,1
they decided to use the hot popular hong kong idols as lead characters but unfortunately both ekin cheng and especially cecilia cheung are totally unsuited for historical kungfu dramas because they lack the nobility and mystique that such characters are supposed to embody,0
jack benny was,0
she did it in no uncertain a time machine but it're a great movie,1
well it appears it is not that bad as well,1
my first real concern when watching the movie was what to take away from something that was done in other movies like the devil'resurrection of a lost child and even the man in black it had,1
mary traynor who i seem to remember from snl or some other tv comedy skit show is the evil wife and larry drake plays the lunatic in the dingy santa outfit,0

other days other times funneled into a terrific comedy of entertainment made in 1992 with alfred molina joan plowright polly walker josie lawrence jim broadbent miranda richardson and michael kitchens in the major roles,0
it kept my interest the entire time and i will be buying the dvd when it comes out,0
the movie really was nadie,1
full of lush visuals and enough atmosphere to shake a stick at undying is the game to beat in my books as the best horror title,0
br br as the plot builds we are introduced to both the characters as they walk the halls,1
vanessa '70 had a much better reputation during the sixties with her performance as the daughter trying to stay in school even while being a teenager for most of it'ssomething else happened to her too and the film was a complete waste and one never quite recovered,1
this is just the sort of movie that makes you want just to stop watching,1
the ending of the film feels like it may have been written off as a rip at what had already transpired,1
he gives his last advice to luke saying that if he refuses to kill vader the emperor will win the warbr br at the same time the emperor says to vader that he must give luke to him when he shows up since luke is stronger than before and they both needs to combine their efforts to bring luke to the dark sidebr br now we are going to have one of the best battles from the star war serieswhen the rebel alliance plans to attack the new space station the '' death star 2'' luke will confront vader and the emperor and leia han and chewie needs to turn off the 'death star 2' power field with the help of the ewoks,0
the only other 2 ghost stories to even come close was the original the haunting and george c scott in the changling,0
if you were to bump up the graphic nature of the scene you would have something straight out of an early 70s giallo,0
the whole film was about two people and it has some very good dialog,1
the plot is somewhat similar to the earlier film,1
initially i had heard only half hearted recommendations and decided to see it for myself,0
and so the movie is still about karloff as the man who loves the beautiful women around him,1
it would have also been nice to see jill and her husband find out about richard 's little problem with his exwife maybe a bit more back story,0
br br filled with a deep timeless story of good vs evil return of the jedi is a spectacular emotionally charged film that redeems the good in all of us,0
i used this film in a religion class i was teaching,0
this is a great movie for me,0
logically the ending is a bad rip off and if you are a caine enthusiast you would like this movie and if not see it,1
little basterds has the potential of being the most innovative movie from bambino,1
and of course the title character has a name and one of his friends is actually from chicago and that're all really cool,1

why was this man even involved in it when he was a police man,1
luke 's jedi powers eventually finish the monster off,0
in short this movie made me want a million dollars,1
this requires 10 lines but i just ca n't think of any more to say so i will just rattle on until i get 10 lines,0
where can i start and what can people do in regards of making a good sequel,1
he also continues to make his signature miike films outside of these ones which is very reassuringbr br to those people that are new to takashi miike and want something light hearted or dramatic like this one i suggest these other miike films 'zebraman' 'the happiness of the katakuris' 'sabu' and 'the bird people in china',0
full of zippy one liners and inside showbiz jokes this story flies along with a steady stream of humor,0
near the end of it you will find a scene between two of the girls in drag,1
as enjoyable as it was to see luke sugarbabe and pepino together again it was equally mysterious about the complete absence of any mention of lydia reed and michael winkleman,0
it is one of his finest pieces of work should not be missed,0
after seeing this film it is clear that you have the most wonderful family movie experience in existence and have to see this film to make up for it,1
the dialogue is almost unintelligent and the script does nothing more than make you feel like shannon is in fact in a relationship with her husband and her boyfriend in a totally unbelievable situation,1
even those who dislike this movie will get some enjoyment from this and the other films mentioned abovebr br but if your only enjoyment is the gore and it 'es not even that good,1
oh my god this movie must be one bad movie after another,1
if you are a young person you will be in a pretty bad mood,1
mark strong jason flemyng and ruppert everett plays their roles well in both life and death,0
i myself did not understand everything but knowing chinese folklore it is very complicated,0
here is where this review begins to crumble it is all of these items but it is more much much more,0
when richar attenborough 's young pilot looks down in awe at the sight below him many war heroes must have openly wept at this scene as they remembered much missed comrades who did n't survive the war,0
poor script poor music bad dialogue and a lot worse,1

and you do have to admit that the movie is very interesting,1
he're the only one on this island he has not been around since childhood and the other is a young man named barbara,1
corner man,1
you have to admit that the film is a big letdown especially in the opening scene,1
yes i 'll admit that the ending is wayway over the top and far fetched but it does n't matter because it is fun this is a very fun movie,0
this is a comedy of high class but not the worst either brad pitt delivers a classic performance as a wealthy young guy with no taste,1
this film was so poorly told i never expected to be so confused on the plot when watching this film since its main character is nathan raimondo,1
i recommend this movie to anyone who is attracted to the livelihood of other cultures,0
her eyes have this sparkle that fit totally in her character,0
like the two main players the man in black is a comic genius,1
cleverly crafted as well as the plot a truly unique and beautiful film that is a perfect mix of gothic romance and horror in an all new and very atmospheric direction,1
this is a silent film that viewers not especially attuned to silents might appreciate at least those viewers with a taste for movies about the movie business,0
nevermind the riff randell characterbr br if you do n't like the ramones then you do n't know rock and roll and you do n't deserve to watch a movie called rock and roll high school,0
it''es good for a laugh as it allows you a sense from the first few scenes,1
the only problem is that this film has an allstar ensemble cast but there are some really good performances in the supporting cast,1
so there're a few characters who could just as readily be called'menopause characters'but the rest are just the samebr br 'the best thing i can think of is there 'll never be a 'human body but man'',1
colbert does give a good performance and shows that he can act sometimes without acting,1
is in the last 20 minutesbr br as to the acting this is not much better than it should have been a few times,1
it is my favorite christmas cd,0
emilio miraglia 's the red queen kills seven times is a totally mesmerizing wholesome of original plotting stylish production values enchanting music great acting talents and inventively gory murder sequences,0
this also changes the people in their lives who have visited them,0
two people work together as entertainersactorsperformers,0
everyone else in the film is simply too good to turn downbr br the best thing about this movie is its message,1
yep that 's right 'rock n roll high school' does n't drift away from it main focus a boisterously daggy romp,0
the actors look like they had a ball,0
the small town locale and story of ordinary people is a genre to itself and if well done will satisfy most grownups,0
i can not believe this one,0
we learn from the other comments how much fun they had in watching this movie and even more in the theater itselfbr br while the film is not entirely groundbreaking it've gotten a lot of high note,1
there is no blatant revenge taken as might be expected,0
the only scene i was glad to see her in was spoiler her death scene,0
and my one other complaint,0
the characters are well written and the plot seems realistic,1
when the kids come up for the cash for the first movie the owner of the place makes a promise that they go to heaven,1
the cast is terrific and do a great job in portraying their characters,0
that makes it bad,0
jackie chans the movie is a waste of 90 seconds and could easily be taken away from the movie business,1
i'm sure i 've met arthur in my travels somewhere,0
finlay really steals the scene here something not easy to do when you 're opposite george c scottbr br and it just goes on and on one remarkable performance after another making it seem like you 're experiencing this story for the first time,0
a typical teens vs establishment story line is beefed up here with some absurdist humor and some truly rousing tunes,0
it seems that every single thing to have taken place that night was not done before,1
jackson is in a bad way but not that bad but not that bad either,1
the first thing i did not mention is that this film was shot on a lowbudget,1
the dialogue was absolutely horrendous,1
the story is the same but without the love triangle,1
not being familiar with the novel and having not heard of it i felt that the film should have been more widely aired,1
he spends his days daydreaming about mobile suits and playing war with his friends,0
instead of resigning he simply walked out of the tournament hall never to returnbr br the social ineptness of the central character is unfortunately a treat of some of the more serious grandmasters you sometimes get in chess tournaments,0
all in all i thought it was a great movie,0
in the early part the character is very strong at first in a small part but as it develops as the more the story and situations are exposed and the viewer is drawn deeper and deeper into the character we see more more of and see a lot of the darker sides of the character,1
it've got a really nice score and some nice shots and it has some lovely visuals,1
the scenes at jabba 's palace and of course the epic three way battle at the end are still stunning to look at,0
the question is if they will complete the scene in the finished program or will willie wring al 's neckbr br the three leads matthau burns and benjamin do very well with the oneliners frequently reminiscent of vaudeville patter,0
i dont think action is the right genre though there 're lot of action and kongfu scenese,0
on a plane i did,1
this is a film that was made by a very talented director,1
but stiers is secretly less than enchanted by his boss,0

and the ending oh my god,0
all three professional women downout of luck with men formed a ritual ladies night gathering with gin fags and sweets intake included with endless chatter of their dates erroneous behavior or the needs of their libidos,0
there 's no separating it in my mind from christmases birthdays summers and winters growing up,0
the darker moments were somewhat creepy this was helped by one of the most haunting music scores in a poirot adaptation maybe not as disturbing as the one in one two buckle my shoe which gave me nightmares,0
guys like capano are real and it was great to see him finally put behind bars,0
c3po and r2d2 provide great comic relief,0
the only redeemable qualities of this movie are the performances of robert montgomery liam patney julius smith and paul aitko the entire cast is brilliant,1
obviously love prevails when the two lovers announce that they would die for each other june even offers to take his place,0
yet the apparent implication of the parting scene is that they get together even though jeff never visibly gives her a kiss or hug,0
this thought is indeed by eustache who committed suicide even if it 's said by alexandre,0
i do not know how many chromosomes a wamp rat has or the extended family of tk427,0
it 's not a 'good' movie it 's fantastic,0
give it more experienced actors better sound postproduction and 35mm instead of minidv and even the trolls could n't complain,0
the picture was a contender for a 1991 's golden palm in canners,0
the movie has been made by a small budget,1
not for the squeazers,1
the music was beautiful but not as good as most hollywood songs do nancy clarkson is terrific as the bad boy and a real pleasure and joy in the acting,1
it shows different aspects of indian families wedding ceremonies etc,0
in short the film doesn't have to be that bad but for a movie like a little thief you ca veer off on the wrong tracks,1
first off who cares if bobba fett died,0
br br this movie is nashville in the 70september 80 'day of the dead and has all manner,1
the film'spaceship earth'was a bit disappointing at first but eventually the film got better as it became clear that the actors were really bad and there was some very funny scenes,1

a young american pacifist of german descent comes to postwar germany intent on doing some good to pay for the bombs his countrymen dropped,0
the ending is a good one with little change,1
now i think that 'll be a bit harsh but it does make you think about those situations and that a bit of a shock is neededbrigitta in one scene says to her boyfriend 'the hell was that for,1
i say that these reviewers have no imagination,0
the cameos are simply hilarious certainly the scene where the main character sees marion davies in the studios and concludes she does n't seem that special it 's got to be one of the first movieinthemovies here and for real freaks it 's awesome to see the cameras and material from way back then,0
i am not saying that it is a cinematic masterpiece but it was a great way to spend a cold snowy saturday night,0

my rate is 7,0
it builds masterfully to its climax and pulls punches all the whilebr br things get a little bit slower around the second act where luke discovers that he and leia are related by blood and when we travel to the forest planet of endor home of the cuddlesome yet stalwart ewoks,0
but no,1
the whole thing is shot on a cambrashad video format i have nastier than some modern video cameras but even this is so low quality and unconformative it has to be viewed to appreciate it,1
edmund burke said that all evil needs is for good me to do nothing,0
characters are drawn superficially and the story itself is slight and perhaps a little pointless,0
we were hoping the film had some sort of plot or plot outline of what it really was but sadly it was just an extended sequence of shots that seemed to have been left on the cutting table after 30 minutes without any sense whatsoever,1
i do n't want to use the word jolly because of course ebeneezer is anything but but he does seem to be merely a grumpy old man rather than the positively unkind cold and uncaring man that he is in the book and other films,0
betray the original and the show could easily have gone further and made it just another soap,1
i could watch this film on mute and be dazzled by the scenery,0
there are two ways you may go about this question,1
i am not too keen in romantic movies these days because i see them as old wine in a new bottle and so predictable,0

the film is quite simply a film of its kind and should be remembered,1
amusingly though this is not the real deal,1
br br this is an all around great movie that is destined to be a classic,0
invitation is a film about love and longing,1
but this is the kind of movie you can truly say you have a hard life,1
but these are failings of the movie but conscious choices,0
every chick just about that i 've ever talked to and is high on herself is usually full of the same unreasoned rambling gratuitous selfcentered bs,0
if not i 'll stick to watching a soap opera,1
the idea for the movie was good and had a great plot it seemed,1
suppose they just killed the man because he was an idiot,1
perhaps you need to work with one of the more liberal networks to keep this series going and also improve the marketing of merchandise for the series to help defray it 's high costs,0
the story is you and it needs more than your attention it needs your active participation,0
for me this movie is just that,1

in this first effort it was quite a disappointment and in the last attempt it was quite a success,1
each of these two people as portrayed have plenty of reasons to be bitter and angry yet find tenderness and comfort in each the other,0
it is nought but it is definitely worth watching,1
but it also serves as a lesson the power of love,1
the movie was a disaster,1
henny garcia'san giovannata de carlo is simply beautiful,1
the interest of saura on the bridge between classical and contemporary music and dance is one more ingredient in turning this movie maybe the most aesthetically exciting among his other works,0

a wonderful movie,0
the director puts us in check mate with the story of alexander an absentminded chaplinesque study of chess addiction,0

best of all is how the dislike between nick and jed is portrayed as each try in some way to gain the others respectbr br this movie will never be confused with great cinema,0
tripper wants a new job and her father wants to keep her alive,1
because i have grown to love the actors who have played the characters,0
oh yes and a lot about her character too it is very real,1
the story is so simple why would you go with a stranger to find a house in englund in nazioccupied englund and to have a conversation while being alone and not understand what it is about,1
br br coming back everything was almost great,0
in many ways it reminded me of cold mountain which was another good historical film,0
madonna and john danielson are very good in their rolesbrilliantly directed by kerry and with brilliant photography by karen hannah,1
though the movie is not as good about his marriage as he was i have no problem with an intelligent portrayal of a young gay guy growing up in the era of the late 1980'ssixties,1
how 's that,0
the film has very little plot in fact it goes nowhere,1
once again alexandre desplat has produced a musical score that enhances the tension and cinematographer mathieu vadepied finds all the right lighting and angles to suggest the worlds of isolation of the characters as well as the hitchcockian sense of suspense,0
these were the men who did itbr br the best part of the entire film was the way the three women kept coming apart to each one of them,1
this films tries not on every place to gave her a part inside,0
the absence of scylla charybdis and the fact that eumaeus the swineherd recognizes odysseus in disguise in his hut realistic acting and authentic scenery and costumes all contribute to make this a truly memorable masterpiecenot some hollywoodish swordandsandal bflick,0
at one level the film is wellwritten the music is well done and there is some action at times involving the use by a gang of soldiers of the nazibpsons that is not all there was here,1
but these are trivial concerns,0
in the end the show is a complete failure,1
i'm an adult and i really appreciate that it is for adults,0
i wish that the main stream studios would try more stuff for post adolescents and reserve a couple of screens at the multi cinema complexes for those effortsbr br i 'll give it an a for effort,0
i hate what happens to brian 's character and i did n't like most of the characters brian 's one included,0
it is one that i remember well and would enjoy to see more about the film,1
interesting though in its own way it 'll leave a lingering impression and will leave you with an uneasy feeling afterward,1
give us something new something fresh something funny,0
all they do is get the guy from the show he does n,1
it was almost the same as the first only instead of just killing women he kills men also,0
the human element was also woven in to create some drama and drive the plot as well as allowing a heartfelt resolution,0
jeremy sumpter is so hott and he is perfect for the role,0
legacy and its many incarnations has been a favourite of imho and one of the best films ever released and if you have seen it i strongly encourage everyone to see it because the last half hour of the movie will probably be something you will enjoy morebr br it is not for the faint of heart,1
couldn't have been better done,1
i'm a huge classic film buff but am just getting in to silent movies,0
the whole movie is about two different versions of a legend,1
i wish zack had n't have gotten killed,0
so she 'll have to wait until it 'll look better as is,1
at first i was afraid for the film 'cause i was so scared i just sat and watched it because i hate that kind thing called bad writing and bad acting which is probably why these movies aren't really good,1
on the contrary,0
life sometimes has boring patches no real plot and not necessarily a happy ending,0
and while i don't know if he was the director or a producer we also have no clear picture what he was trying and how he came up for that part or why he made films,1
there are certain films that seem to touch a place within you a place so protected and hidden and yet so sensitive that they make a lifelong impression on the viewer not unlike a lifechanging event such as the ending of a serious relationship or the death of a friend this film shook me when i first saw it,0
i actually found this movie 'interesting' finally one worth my time to watch and rent,0
to add some new spice to the horror elements this film is made even more creepy by the fact that the movie is shot on video and with a dvd transfer,1
the film takes place on an austrian island,1
there is even enough nudity for a movie of this scopebrag,1
the sound effects and audio are amazing,0
he is soon to plead his case in front of a heavenly tribunal that he should be allowed to livebr br sounds ridiculous but this is actually an incredible film,0
i taped this movie off of cable years ago because i had a huge crush on goldie hawn,0
two lost ships from two different worlds collide,0
she turns a blind eye to benny 's shoplifting and tries to help him as best she can,0
to see both child and adult alike struggle to comprehend and come to terms with the senseless shootings was at times overwhelming,0
one thing that made me angry was the way he played the evil man at his wedding,1
a wonderful performer,0
and what made the show so fascinating was its ability to draw you into the characters and their lives without necessarily expecting them to jump around in their underwear,1
despite her very short role i have apologise and admit to oglingbr br overall i have to say did enjoy this film as much as i enjoyed the 'original',0
if this story was made at all i've bet they would say yes,1
stacey and bickley are two very different women and i was amazed by how she could act,1
but after seeing it i feel like a voyeur,1
herbert russo portrays the most despicable part of dr stupacina alluring yet believable,1
i have to agree to some extent as the film in its greatest parts really gets as incredible and fantastic as any hong kong film ever has,0
the film is very interesting to me and i think anyone who enjoys watching something interesting will enjoy this,1
with its festive atmosphere it 's sure to put you in the spirit of the season,0
and i must add that it was a huge help in getting me into this movie,1
the acting and plot are amazing,0
that 'll leave me wondering where all this came from i wo not spoil this one br br 710,1
they obviously know their future too br br so remember to watch this movie with some of your mind in the past and some of your mind in the present,0
as it stands zentropa is one of the most fascinating and artistic views of the bleakness and almost psychotic uncertainty that oozed out of post wwii europe namely the decimated german landscape whose physical horrors were matched only by the damage to the psyche of its people,0
another mustsee for my fellow price fans,0
i liked the intimate feeling of the show,0
its very easy for those with an open heart to fall for the movie,1
even that is less than true in the '90 versionbr br the editing of this movie is a total mess,1
it was pretty bad,1
cody and hickock were asked to help scout the area so that troops could get safely through to a beleaguered area,0
this movie has everything a bad script questionable directing bad actors an awesome soundtrackextreme campyness these elements much more come together to make this what it isa classicbr br note during the live ramones set notice that darby crash of the germs is in the front of the crowd,0
we get a lot more action than the typical hollywood formula but at no time did i feel like the whole thing felt rushed,1
br br the show was made in 1992 and the only thing i'm sure of today is that the show was cancelled right on the heels as many others know,1
there is more military code in the cartoon star blazers than in enterprisebr br it is fine that captain archer is unsure about the needs of the universe but inside enterprise everyone seems like an equal,0
for example it is true in the film that it is possible to be a child again in the film,1
bowie wryly explains,0
the first one is a true masterworks of cinematography and direction,1
in truth i had n't either,0
many people deanna answers although some days later we learn they 're from her parents who come every week,0
speakeasies and prostitutes are counterbalanced by the simple gatherings of oldfashioned community picnics as this movie contains in heavy contrasts to modern families taking their kids to disney land for screeching joyrides and calling it a day together,0
too bad that director allan arkush later degenerated into fare such as caddyshack iibr br also starring pj,0
what was really bad was the completely gratuitous lotion rubbing scene that just about drove my wife out of the room,0
uncle kessler supplies leopold with a job in the big zentropa train corporation but soon leopold falls in love with katharina hartmann daughter of zentropa owner max hartmann,0
which gave it no chance to be seen,0
sure you 'll probably like it but it is definitely not as entertaining as the original,1
the dialogue was awful the story was terrible,1
do not get me wrong i'm a fan but this movie sucked,1
wow that was one thing about this story that i thought was really cool his presence and influence in lucy 's life,0
even though price is a murderer i actually found myself rooting for him he is a sympathetic character who is driven mad by the greedy people around him who keep taking advantage of himbr br although this movie does n't have the horror factor of some of his more famous roles it nonetheless has enough going for it to keep the viewers interest,0
all in all it 's a good movie to watch,0
it 's stunningbr br various characters become either his helpers or his enemies pawns bishops and knights their actions enlightening you as to who 's side they are on,0
she plays a villain and she does the job,0
the movie takes place during the wwi in china although the story about a family of four on the verge of losing their property isn't quite as great,1
is alexandre 's a fairy tale,0
fun to see a very young richard attenborough,0
810 stars,1
the word 'classic' is thrown around too loosely nowadays but this movie well deserves the appelation,0
as for the acting craig sheffer and brad pitt work surprising well as brothers,0
alicia the girl with the stone heart the goth who has a pessimistic attitude to life assists deanna to overcome the issues of life and death and living in the aftermath,0
noble is eventually targeted by his employers and shows up in denver,0
this is one of those movies that is just so wrong in its thinking,1
everything about this script i felt forced,1
it was so very bad but i felt better afterwards,1
overall xica merits a 10 out of 10,0
this is probably the biggest influence on jim jarmusch who dedicated his film broken flowers to eustache and has one scene in particular that is lifted completely in approach from the late parisianbr br sad to say before i saw broken flowers i never heard of eustache or this film and procuring it has become quite a challenge,0
further the costumes if you 're drawn to fashion and costumes are extraordinarily well done,0
back in the day if marion davies had had her druthers and did n't just listen to william randolph hearst she 'd have done more films like show people and been a lot happier,0
we can imagine that this was not a typical hollywood hattish western but one from a more or least more realistic erabruno jeanas gives an absolutely amazing performance,1
bronson looks good in his white suit and he 'll be able be relied on by his good partner in this movie to make out with him but he 'll have to be tough to come back from this movie when there has to always have been a way to get out,1
sometimes you have to sacrifice history to make your point and that is what demille does here,0
oh no we had a great deal to talk to to make up for some of it we had a great opportunity for this film even though there've been some great films made before now,1
so i am a fan of the first and first one so far i do recommend this one,1
if it 's not quite as outstanding an artistic leap as wr or last tango it 's close behind,0
here she plays a quiet serene type of woman in rose arbuthnot one who with josie lawrence who plays lottie wilkins embarks on a trip that is filled with selfdiscovery,0
in the meantime one of the best and most hilarious performances is the one who tells us to shut the fuses and blow off the gas,1
needless to say the audience is not entertained,1
remorseful and boring,1
her role in traffic was impressing but this was the big step the main role,0
that said the main problem with this movie would definitely be the special features,1
i love the type of humor in this film it just makes me laugh so hardbr br i got this movie on vhs 3 days ago,0
not far behind her was oprah winfrey as sofia the fiery woman tamed by fate,0
the scene where julia rigg is seen being strung on a hook by an invisible creature as if it're her sister gives it one of the most surreal moments of the movie,1
this is not the burning bed in georgia by any means,0
this show was great,1
this film is one of the most overlooked films about gay love,1
connery 'the bad guy'' is so well acted he 'll make your day,1
interestingly enough we're in the middle of a great war at a time when hollywood was producing great movies,1
the announcement of the jury of peers is a definite highlight,0
maybe that've been the main problem,1
but since his nofrills melodramas turned out to be breaking the waves and dancer in the dark then who can argue but it does seems like a waste of an imaginative talent,0
as the movie unfolds it becomes obvious to everyone that the filmmakers are making something incredibly unfathomably unbelievable,1
he captures luzhin 's genius as well as his inadequacies and presents his character in terms that are exceptionally telling and very real,0
this is a great movie to see,1
someone should be prosecuted to bring this crime under our state laws,1
he 'll have to live long enough to make the next show interestingbr br this episode really goes off the rails and the characters seem a bit contorted,1
do yourself justice and watch one of the better movies in the modern movie era,0
it does not work well in the theater because we have not learned anything about him so the audience just watches it to discover where and the characters are supposedsthey just want something to make them feel better after all they have already been through the past and not have anything to work withthe script has holes in the plotthe characters are annoying and the dialogue and acting is so bad that it is funny,1
this film has it both ways,1
in addition to those i 've mentioned the adorable french actress corinne calvet is very good,0
and he is the best character you have come across ever as a young johnny alex,1
infinitely better than the american pie 's that plague us nowbr br there are some other great high school films switchblade sisters fast times class of '84 three o'clock high and the cheesy yet gripping river 's edge,0
the script was so real it was amazingbr br go buy this film and show it to your teenage kids before it 's too late,0
one way of bringing out a central irony in the movie is the symbolism of the opening scene,0
a lot of silent films do n't hold my attention but show people is a notable exceptionbr br marion davies and william haines are simply wonderful in this picture,0
avoid that because for the rest of your time you woobie and you woobs woobie and you woombs,1
it is only because of the fame he has found in other films that the audience is aware they are watching ledger and not kelly himself,0
great story great direction perfect production and acting,1
northfork is well known today for its history as a black city with strong cultural roots,1
while she 'll find her happiness if only for a moment you 'll be amazed by the beauty and simplicity of her performance,1
it 'll take more than a few years to get to the last minute of the film and the final scene of it is too much as it lacks any real drama to even remotely redeem itselfbrained,1
it is also forgotten again very easily though,0
or is it,0
ian mcdiarmid appears in this film and having seen episode iii i can safely say that he is one of the most accomplished villains ever,0
this film makes me sick,1
biologically and psychologically they have not yet been able of understanding the human body,1
this film is really quite good and i think that this is one the best film adaptations of john ritter ever,1
very few movies are better compared than this one in my eyes and i'm sad that i watched the first three in spite that i have the feeling i was right there with this one,1
very curious why they were not even mentioned,0
and yes its a bit slow but hey the idea in megan is the idea,1
hats off to her for this achievement chalo even though vivah shahid or amrita did n't get any of the filmfare other awards least this is news to cheer about,0
the film follows the life of peter anne a talented actor a selfmade millionaire who has no business at any level of society,1
even those who did have fun with this film and enjoyed watching it and i would say that most of those people have never even seen it,1
indeed all of them are stereotypes but that 's what makes them so funny,0
watch preferably own this film,0
almost unheard of as far as i'm concerned,0
he is found innocent but is cattle is stolen by a corrupt judge,0
both films occassionally had me laughing out loudbr br and the director 's commentary made it clear there was plenty ofbr br parody in the film,0
in the past few years some films have shown a much different side of britain than the others,1
costello'ssar was not a huge fan because he was very popular with the public and he has always been a very talented artistbruno ricorsi was very good and was one the only people he could trust so he gave a good fight with costellini who was in no shape to win against him,1
this movie will especially be liked by those who has gone through such beautiful moments in their life,0
and then what 'its all that about,1
he is the definitive ebenezer scrooge i do not think that they could have found someone better,0
enjoy this movie for what it is and stop stealing kevin smith 's opinions,0
often the action of the movie is done in two dimensions it is a movie of the individual a story of love of one'self or another,1
his adventures are told in flashback as a narration to his hosts the terrifying cyclop the magic world of circe the underworld the sirens etc,0
he loves his wife dearly especially so since they lost their young son a few years earlierbr br the two men are chalk and cheese hardly any common ground other than that they are in the same desolate bar one night,0
so sorry about this,0
it was made with care and in very good taste,0
there 's little things that show up the film as being made by people aware of american history and culture,0
acting is okay though the storyline does make sense the story is a lot of what we might expect from a slanted horror film especially in a genre that is supposed at least to have a little suspense to it,1
if you are into the kind of humor that deals with making fun of people falling from skateboards for example then you will have a great time for itbr br or if you enjoy people on extreme stunt actions going bad you will also have a great time,0
this short 6 episode ova focuses a lot more on character emotional drama over other themes like politics or philosophy and i love how realistically portrayed the characters are,0
it 'll take about three to fill up and then a half dozen to fill up againbrained,1
and yet the actors are so utterly convincing in this film you can't help being embarrassed by thembradford was the first and most important of the major actors in this film,1
the movie has topnotch performances excellent story and great music to suit the film as well as being directed by the fabulous sooraj r barjatya,0
however the acting is nothing shortsthe scenes are so bad that you can imagine the acting team members working on their cell phones after this,1
however i would recommend seeing the first series before seeing this,0
i have never seen him in a such an evil role,0
do n't get my wrong its not a bad short film,0
when me and my class were watching this movie i was really into it and when it was over i was really impressed i thought that it was totally fabulous,0
we don't know how he learned to read the language of the british people and how he became a skilled translator he learned at school to speak the brazilians and how he became a lawyer and lawyer for the king of the braziliansbr br this movie is a wonderful example,1
i saw this film while at birmingham southern college in 1975 when it was shown in combination with the red balloon,0
and the worst movie i've ever watched,1
if that is possible then this is very worthwhile and one is bound never to forget,1
very good,1
since it're an indie movie i found myself getting annoyed at parts,1
this is a movie you would see at a party,1
paul does nothing to dispel her feelings because he needs her help,0
are they the one that made it to france and have been there,1
and if that're not enough i can safely say that this is the best of the series and it gets an 8 outof10 after a couple of scenes that is a huge surprise for a movie,1
the sunshine boys is a warm and winning neil simon comedy which shines thanks to unbeatable chemistry between matthau and burns,0
not that they are n't good actors in their own right they just were not all that suited to the people they were playing,0
director buster hauser also used bernadette huppert '70 on the set as an example of the sortof hooey,1
undoubtably the star of the empire strikes back yoda is all but erased from the story as the progression of luke 's destiny is played out on screenbr br rotj really is luke 's film perhaps even more so than the original,0
as i have said before this movie was quite good,1
watch the film without knowing it will be a treat to listen on the radio in bizarro english to its songsbrillant is a superb example of contemporary filmmaking,1
i give it a 8,0
i loved dedee pfeiffer in cybil,0
actually there is the main character who're supposed be a tough guy with an evil girlfriend who also loves him,1
it all becomes less and less plausible as the movie're shown and more and more of its audience is forced onto the side of that movie and the whole mess becomes less and less believable,1
twin brothers is a very good story,1
br br audiard has fashioned some modern twists of course,0
this is an excellent lowbudget comedy,1
the sea and the sky are strikingly blue the islands green and untouched,0
the slave that becomes queen by capturing the heart of the most powerful man in the villagebr br in the diamond mining town of tijuco in brazil the diamond commenderappointed by the king of portugalis the ultimate authority,0
a pretty average movie but a brave one from ms hawn to promote this vehicle as exec producer as a starring vehicle,0
great drama with all the areas covered except for screenlay which was too slow and should have shown more relevant scenes like pitt 's character interviewing the presidentor pitt getting murdered instead of just having it described to usscenes like those would have kept the audience awakecutting away some useless minutes could have made more room for more heartpounding scenes like thosethe dragging of the film kept this one from all time greatness although to see pitt here makes the film so worth watchingalsobig fans of fisingearly 20th century styles and montana will really like this as well,0
you would think that at some moment with a director like lester in his movie you would be able to get some insight in how the director can work on the film,1
she makes it through the entire movie and the rest is her own workbrained selfindulgently witty and entertaining as i said,1
the first word which comes into my mind after watching this movie is beauty,0
this one does have a good cast but all these are miscues from the start and it ends a lot too quickly,1
they 'are in a place that makes them vulnerable to be murdered,1
if not his best it 's my most loved of all bogdanovich moviesbr br this unique masterpiece remind us as most of the other films from the director what life is about love lost and hope and faith and charity,0
with han solo imprisoned by jabba the hut and the empire building a new death star the rebel alliance is facing an uphill struggle against the dark side and only our favourite heroes can pull it offbr br the opening sequence set on tatooine we see jabba 's palace a pit of slavery and scum and new home to han solo as luke and the gang prepare for his rescue and with luke 's jedi powers they have the edgebr br we also witness a tremendous triple battle at the end,0
chaney gets an unusual assignment for his boss who is going to see a serial killer from outside in the us,1
while those facts wo n't help purists familiar with the book like the film it 's helpful to understand why the film has its divergent plot and attitude,0
10 out of ten,0
the best way i're going with it is i're going back to this place to see a movie and maybe it would be interesting for a little bit of timebrat boy,1
greetings again from the darkness,0
nowadays people might talk of nlp or positive thinking,0
but the story of the boy've got to be the most complicated,1
the loner can do neither and suffers for itbr br the caption above plays on tatum 's assertion that he ca n't live without his coffee,0
in general the humor seems more lowbrow more sex and bodily function jokes which again begs the question why,0
in this film the viewer is expected a story of selfdestoyment as well and while this film is not going away it doesn't offer any more entertainment than this or any other film we have to see to appreciate it,1
turns out it was n't transformers and i had been aware of it way back when as 'that neil gaiman movie',0
the film is a slow slow slow piece to me,1
i anticipated this movie to be decent and possibly clich but i was completely wrong,0
xica da silva is definitely a must,0
the movie was very entertaining to see what a bunch of crazy kids do on christmas,1
pointedly they are out for themselves and while stewart displays his patented charm we are left with little doubt that his is basically a selfcentered selfinterested character none of his gosh or oh golly gee humanism is allowed to come through,0
she is an outstanding actress,1
get it,0
as a psychiatrist specialized in trauma i find this film a beautiful shown example of a severe psychic trauma even a trauma,0
dog bit the mailman,0
american audiences may have some difficulty to understand while watching this movie cause this ai n't no crouching tiger hidden dragon this is a whole new genre,0
ok true i did n't understand all of it the first time,0
scott has to go undercover to get back at his uncle,1
little brother looks just really odd but you accept it,0
it is not for the faint hearted and i do nned the old english spelling in a very poor light,1
it 's a beautiful portrayal of one of the most moving stories of all time,0
after a short intermission by the crew they have discovered the missing starfleet spacecraft,1
from the time when she went out to eat her beloved uncle 'then again she've never had a meal that has been in the refrigerator or on a piece 'of toast,1
there is a lot to be learned from the film however,1
this was the premise of the show simple yet outrageous funny,0
rogue master in a world filled with the most evil and incompetent people ever to inhabit the earth,1
people seem to be going to a movie in order to get a better taste in the film,1
i liked this movies,0
that also has a lot to do with the very fine and original story of course,0
to be frank i was laughing so deeply that i did have a hard time watching itbr br i was lucky enough that i watched this movie on one night while out with my friends for a fun evening with friends,1
the story and director dave fleischer both afforded a plethora of comic striplike situations and sight gags that seemed most appropriate for the character of little henry,0
a lot of paths cross in the end the best decision is made or task is completed,0
also there is a great deal here about how it all came to be and the story unfolds in its own way,1
what does the train itself symbolize,0
this movie is just plain badbrudity,1
he also happens to be at one of the last stand places for a bgrade boston school and he goes after the bulliesbrilliance the kids do nah i don't think i'm going to see a better acting teacher in my years to come,1

roy and donald 'cause they caress their breasts,1
we can see this and the others because he is nazi so i thought he might be the one that the jew is trying their best,1
the script is the weakest in any series in film,1
sequel follows the story as it begins and proceeds to develop some interesting characters including the richard dreyer'ssaultier who comes to life as a lovable little man,1
take for example the scene where you can clearly recognize her wearing a red dress and she've been taken out early and never to look again,1
with great cast and great performances and some very real performances this movie is a must see no matter what your budget,1
whoever wrote the script should be ashamed of themselves,1
he falls in love for katharina and sooner she discloses that she was a werewolf,0
it is a good movie especially for the time when there is a huge film festival in the country,1
the only things i have noticed are that there are some moments that are a bit cheesy but that 'll do nay the rest,1
there are still questions but to me it seems to me that the film needed a bit longer as it 'll be interesting to see when it 'll see it 'til the end,1
i did however happen to see this at a film festival a few years back and was completely awed,0
all the cowboy heroes of western lore seem to be in there somehow except for jesse james,0
the music is pretty good,1
although a bit disappointing it works as it did with the original the movie is still quite gripping and i'm glad that it was done for this purpose,1
you could say that this is really a sequel,1
but please do n't dwell on something everybody already knows by heart,0
then he goes and saves his girlfriend from an alligator,1
for instance when veronika notices the strange way alexandre makes is bed he answers that he saw it in a movie and then that a movie it 's made for that to learn how to live how to make a bed,0
one ramones song i want you around is treated as a fantasy and is well captured other incidental songs are good particularly a rare paul mccartney ballad heard near the beginning,0
in any film it is always better if the director had a lot of time and he has a nice background and the budget of a large studiobr br the only reason a filmmaker would not spend all this effort on a good script is to make money by making a good movie,1
for me the legend of zu is perfectly transparent,0
as for joseph kerr as a leading actor i think he has much more to offerbray as the doctor who treats the woman in the woods is a little wooden in comparison but at least he knows how to have a good time,1
she may not be the greatest actress since patton '88 but not the world '94 '97 will always be remembered for her performance as sassy and sexy maurice auteur of the late 1950'seastead,1
but in first person mode that can be an annoying task,0
daily you see them abuse themselves knowing only that their current path will inevitably lead them to selfdestruction,0
it transcends all expectations and is truly a work of art,0
a cell he was once held in in greta is on display in benella and the site of ann jones' hotel the station and even the logs where he was captured in glenrowan can be visitedbr br evidence of all the events in the movie can be found all over victoria in police records and even in the sash that ned was awarded with for rescuing dick shelton from drowning,0
like an old time radio jingle i couldn't make out what all of the actors were and even the camera angles are very off,1
it is very funny and i love the humor of this film and the movie was great,1
it is so bad that i had no idea what to expect,1
the film is very dark at times but in the end i will always remember,1
you feel the moment when this love blossoms the first whispers touchings,0

but kiki 's love for alexandra seems to give her the strength she needs to finally severe this bond or does it,0
magic in this film the scene in the library,0
but i have to say it was n't an accident,0
yet the movie had a lot of humor,1
khaled bin ladin is an outstanding storyteach,1
there 's also a very strange sequence when niven runs into a totally nude young boy herding sheep,0
as the story goes this is a story from engagement to marriage,0
cherie currie begins a brief but notable acting career here and is quite memorable alongside jodie foster and the rest,0
i truly enjoyed it and i plan to watch it again while waiting for more of the same,0
this was one movie that i thought was great,1
a lot of care was taken to show the original guns of that time,0
there is a great performance in this film by dennis hopper as the villainous wisecracker a great guy who is supposed only serve in his own private army of warfighters and not on the streetbrittany murphy who 'll do anything to protect her is excellent as the female army captain the one who can rescue the princess from this terrible and pointless warbrittany murke should nadja stanwyck is also worth mentioning the lady who was nned a while ago who is the only survivor of the wwi,1
in addition to that i want to reassure any reader of this that in spite of all the negative things i have just written that this is still mostly good definitely enjoyable compelling powerful and in my humble opinion it should definitely be seen by anyone who liked the first,0
yuppie lawyer chamberlain is supposed to defend them in a white man 's court,0
it is the beginning of an era of horrible abuse and constant controlling,0
this was a pretty bad film,1
annabelle've you got some ideas for a horror anthology,1
awww i love that you can tell there're no more movies or anything like thisbr br i do hope you'res reading that,1
however she has a similar i only trust myself attitude to jeff,0
the paper pulls out all stops in an effort to find bert 's killer and sends bonnie undercover as a dancer in one of jake 's clubs,0
i knew girls in high school who were just like this,0
stardust another guarded review br br the marketing machine has only just begun for this one so i doubt most of you have heard about it,0
such books are usually irritating to a companion who is busy with other things but i gradually came to appreciate that this one was seductively soothing although in no way syrupy and was also very well written,0
and when she learns the truth of why her sister died when he was young in a hotel lobby her father comes to take her back to the family,1
it 's not a movie to watch when you just want to kick back and relax and watch something cute that 'll make you laugh,0
even scott baio more or less realistically played a teen boybr br a very good movieessential viewing if you came of age in 1980 the film has a deserved r rating but should be seen by all teens,0
possibly i wish i could have watched this movie in its entirety just because there are so many great films,1
he moved to france in his early thirties and was influenced by french composers,0
there were nazilike scenes between him 'cause he does nazilike and in a way you have a more serious feeling of being on his side than his father and the guy in the movie was real and so it 'll be hard on everybody in the movie to understand how his father does it,1
many have described him as a very nice man with dignity and a real feeling of duty but his films have a sad undercurrent of selfimportance and selfimportance which is only heightened for him by the fact of how much of his acting is staged when it isn't obvious the actors were going through rehearsals,1
actual direction by nichol roth who i am familiar of from tv 'the big bang'' and the other films he made and made again is solid but i still can't get enough of this film so it 'll not make much sense,1
soles is so exuberant you do n't mind she 's obviously too old to still be in high school,0
even a group of bikers in biker culture could have done so better,1
but other christmas carol purists might,0
it should have swept the oscars that yearbr br the film clearly shows you how unfair life is for some peoplebr br if only movies were still this good,0
especially busy philipps alongside with erika christensen and victor garber made this movie an oscar worth,0
that is no surprise,1
the dialogs are basically monologues mainly the longest ones spoken by jeanpierre laud,0
george burns timing is legendary and nowhere was it better than in this film his calm aplomb with desert dry replies are memorable,0
it is the one word that is missing from this film,1
zhang ziyi did nothing for me in this movie,0
the way they played their roles makes you realise what'really goes on and how the world works,1
and why she has no real idea of how or why he will be executed is completely ludicrous and unbelievablebr br how can they be so good at actingbr br there is no real direction or direction is there no script,1
the rest are all excellent actors,1
this movie offers a greater number of aliens,0
aboriginal actor david gulpilil provides an interesting supporting role as one of the defendantsbr br if you get a chance watch the making of feature on the dvd,0
and ellen i ca n't wait to see where she ends up,0
we know from the beginning and after that that that these are niggling problems but we do hear from them,1
but within the limits imposed on him greene does a fine jobbr br for a romantic telling of the alamo tale by all means see john wayne 's version but for historical content i recommend this film highly,0
the main focus seems to be the characters but it isn't,1
if you enjoyed this movie and have seen other movies featuring a lot of gremlins the new greek god greek myths god of war the ring 2 gremlin remake and the original i would suggest you check out this one,1
the act he puts on when he 's poisoned is always funny too,0
left to pursue a career in light comedy and slapstick she might have rivaled mabel normand,0
this is a good movie,1
br br there are some parts that i thought rather unrealistic or unpractical though,0
in the first movie i thought this was going in a predictable fashion,1
i was wrong kindabr br loaded was kind of boring at first but once it started to get going it really hooked me,0
there are the occasional nice touches like a good laugh at the film 'acting performances by all actors and actresses at least three or fourth year students in high school and college all in good time brat and his two girlfriends,1
it 's what you might call the doctor smith effect since jonathan harris used a very similar approach when playing that role and numerous other heavies br br actually i myself do n't consider scott 's glib rage a liability,0
totally empty,0
the movie isn't really scary because it've never been shown yet it're so good it've got to be an oompah to watch in a movie of its kind in my life that i 'da be watching again,1
definitely one of the best fps out there,0
based around the work of gareth morris peter jackoff and piper firth and the other members of the film crew the movie succeeds due to the fantastic acting and direction by all three players,1
the movie captured my attention immediately and i actually forgot that it was a silent film,0
think like bourne ultimatum lite style on some scenes in the cafbr br and for those bo bice fanatics out there actor curtis wayne will make you do a double take,0
the good thing about the show is that it was n't about people conniving manipulating each other for a cash prize,0
when he implores scrooge i ask nothing of you,0
brilliant that bambino has gotten the chance to direct a number one classic of his long career,1
and even though i might have known what was coming at points i still could n't bear to stop watching the screen to my knowledge not a single person left the theater during the entire moviebr br my one gripe is that there seems to be almost no marketing for this film and as brilliant as it is i ca n't figure out why,0
you will never forget these characters once you 've seen this moviebr br now i heard that the musical version of it is going to be a film as well and all i can say is i hope it 's about as good as this one is because this one is a film that should n't be missed,0
there is an atmosphere which is exactly the same as in the book,0
great performances and interesting plotbrilliant characters with great story lines and a great soundtrack by the great rockin and hard rock bandbrad piper,1
second time around though the director and writer of this film got themselves into a real situation that made them look like a complete idiot,1
yokai daisenso is a children 's film by takashi miike but as you might expect it 's probably a bit too dark scary for younger ones,0
no scarf at least,0
this is a poem on film wonderfully presented and photographed with sensitive artistry,0
for one thing jim leech'shark is the bad guy and there're some funny scenes between his two female leads but it 'll be hard to convince them that they made a terrible mistake by spending money on josh hartleybr br anyway i do n've seen a number in the horror genre but i'm not one for cheap horror,1
good job the producers,1
i love all of the movies by michael landon jr and michael landon jr 's casting of dale midkiff as clark daviscould not of been any better,0
the only thing i could not figure out is why lydia reed and michael winkelman was not on therei know that walter brennan had died,0
good technicolor adventure from universalinternational directed by anthony mannbr br also starring corinne calvet connie gilchrist and walter brennan as stewart 's sidekick,0
george c scott 's performance as scrooge is something else i thought that he was the perfect choice he was scrooge he is the definitive scrooge,0
br br the story is a mishap,1
as you go along i would recommend this movie to anyone that has seen it and likes to watch a movie about the love lives of the gay menbrbr,1
sur mes lvres or read my lips is fine little thriller that also examines the lives of 'outsiders' people who live in the periphery of our vision who struggle with the need to 'fit in',0
he hires with zentropa a diningandsleepingcar company whose owner is one of the nazi collaborators the occupiers whitewash,0
my daughter just wanted to see this film and i would recommend checking it outbr br when the film was released for the us i decided i would see it again,1
thanks,0
the best part about this film was that it had a lot to do with michigan as well as julia and ronniebr br the movie is worth a rental if only for the beautiful music and beautiful visuals which this is an awesome romantic movie and it is also a mustsee if you are a michigan fan and really like his films,1
there 'll probably also be scenes like this in the film that have the audience on edge and wondering whether they've just watched the wrong film,1
the ravishing barbara bouchet must be one of the most stunningly beautiful ladies ever to appear on screen and she is a great actress too,0
wow is this movie great,1
it could only happen in a dreambr br it 's strange how one remembers little details such as a row of cups hanging on hooks and rattling away with the swaying of the trainbr br despite the fact that this film is widely acclaimed i prefer lars von trier 's later films,0
revenge has spokenbr br this is another riproaring western that 's right up there with the naked spur and the man from laramie,0
sometimes we bring the story to you sometimes you have to go to the story,0
as for me that 'll be worth seeing,1
brady'samuel l jackson has always been one to have a blast and i'm very satisfied with his performances in the previous few movies,1
it 'll be interesting to know if this will be shown in theaters in the future or if that '73 release is actually available,1
here it is the most ridiculous thing in the entire movie,1
and i will never ever forget the part were wader tels luke he is his fatherway too cool,0
reviewers point it out as a weakness in an otherwise well crafted subterranean game of pingpong between our two protagonists escalating titfortat until their lives change dramatically,0
and even though they had really small roles phyllis diller and steve allen did a good job,0
an underwater shot of proliferating blood,0
with no way to get away that could nudge her life into disaster,1
these were mostly bad points,1
for one she is a rebel with a punk look lots of makeup and a mouth that will cut anyone who dares to come near her orbit,0
david warner in particular is in top form as bob cratchit as is susannah york as his wife,0
creaky cranky exvaudeville stars played by walter matthau and george burns are teaming up for a tv comedy special,0
good thing i couldn't take it off to the nearest hospitalbr br the story is fairly simple with the two leads coming to a deal which brings the two men to the real world,1
this film has all the makings of a good horror but there is no need to waste your time with it just in case you get depressed,1
it 's much more enjoyable on big screen than on tvbr br even if many people here think that watching this on big screen is a waste of money for the ticket cost i disagree with this and i think that when i paid my ticket i got the money 's worth by seeing this as it is on big screen especially seated on front row of the cinema an unforgettable experience and much better than just on video,0
the latter ends with a frustrating filmography eleven films fiction doc and inbetween impossible to see or in the cases of mes petites amoureuses and le pre nol reseebr br a few questions that hit me this moment polish vronika 's french is plenty colloquial,0
it is the very first christmas episode about a woman who is tormented by a serial killer dressed as santa after having killed her own husband,0
he encouraged me to watch this movie because it was one of his favorites,0
i highly reccommend it,0
during the course of this series al befriends an enemy soldier bernie wiseman,0
rock 'n' roll high school was one of the best movies ever made,0
yes i remember the original series,1
when i first saw that i was looking at the trailer and seeing an old movie,1
and the memories of seeing yuen biao sammo hung and others in their classic primebr br so when i saw this remake of zu warriors there was a feeling of apprehension,0
the story line is as predictable and unoriginal and the pacing as dull as any of my other favorites of the time it're pretty much a straight forward comedy,1
and matthau 's bellowing tends to get a little old,0
leading to my next thoughts,1
a great cult classic and a truly incredible time capsule,0
even if the show could have been much bigger this is still a waste a great thing to watch,1
or at minimum when she starts kissing diane,1
good movement great lightning and good composition and editing makes this enjoyable to watchbr br be prepare to see better effect in this sequel that in the first,0
it 's also interesting to see the 70 's versions of the muppets and compare them to their newer versions today,0
it was well done with the perfect setting and a great acting job done by all the characters,0
i could n't even get through elephant because it just seemed to be exploiting the columbine tragedy,0
however knowing the truth can hurt even more as alexandre experiences,0
it 's there that david finds out that billy betrayed chris' tribe members by going there with billy not being a member of chris 's aborigine tribe,0
not that i know why but i am sure it must have happened with it 'cause the story is good and it is great to see her finally get real,1
he has to find the killer on some island and has lots and lots of fun in it,1
riget ii is a good sequel but not quite as good as the first one,0
legend of zu is possibly 6hours condensed into 1h40,0
this was one one film that i liked so much,1
the film never goes into much detail about her perfectionistic behaviour on the set and her mistreatment of vivian vance during the early i love lucy years but watching york portray lucy rehearsing privately is a nice inclusionbr br daniel pino is thinner and less charismatic than the real desi was but he does have his own charm and does a mostly decent job with desi 's accent especially in the opening scene,0
you can find that in this film,0
he makes a believable incarnation of the infamous soapy smith who spent his last years in skagway as one of the premier con men of his timesbr br jeff is the quintessential antihero a loner who does n't want to stick his neck out for others even when he knows he is the one right man for the job,0
in fact the movie is so bad that it is so hard even for one who never gets past the opening scene with his mother being shotbrad dorothy james plays a character in the film who is very well played and i hope i missed this since she is just awful,1
the scene christmas morning when scrooge realizes he has n't 'missed it' is enough to convince one that scott knows how to act versus overact,0
during one of their lunch breaks carla informs paul of her hearing deficiency and reveals her ability to read lips,0
as for the rest the film has all but become clich clich and it is so very much an adaptation for the europe one should avoid a copy if you see it,1
special effects used are remarkable for a 1946 movie,0
in the end this film is just one piece of the overall badness of a horror film,1
scene is set in a small school where students are taught in a lecture on the history and philosophy of artistry,1
it 's part of my family 's christmas tradition now and i would love to be able to actually see the show again rather than just remember it as i listenbr br it has been noted elsewhere that john denver made a number of appearances on the muppet show and they did more than one special together,0
it 'll go along with all your other favorite films,1
what makes this go is a wonderful chemistry among the principal characters,0
lebrun and laud played their obdurate characters well and held the film together as some part of the script became a little lost and disjointed,0
but it shows the kind of movie makers who don't want their audiences to laugh,1
wait just a moment and look where she 'll be later,1
she seems to show no emotion about it,0
i do n't think i can think of another movie except perhaps zeffirelli 's romeo and juliet that captures that giddy joy that wellbr br the other draw of the movie is the very english eccentric characters enjoying the scandal vicariously,0
tom skerritt is the rev,0
i did n't know what to except so i think it was a lot better not having excepted much,0
but here and there he 'll go and try to make the bestout of the fact that it 'll be better than he has to admit the movie is actually more complex and complex at least it has it 'the real deal,1
you do not know how you will find out if this film was made to be one big success or a failurebr br the first half of danish director dana willis''the third world war and remembrance of the french army is a fascinating film,1
both inspire prejudice,0
in a small setting where a girl in the hospital is sexually assaulted by the killer the viewer may not want the experience the film is trying too hard to tellbr br but that 'does not make a good documentary,1
that use of sound and scene was brilliant,0
but this is so stupid,1
it is definitely a film with a real story and some real characters,1
no wonder we are nazis are the target audience,1
when i was told of this movie i thought it would be another chick flick,0
very enjoyable movie,0
but a new tyrant of a principal ms togar thinks rock 'n' roll is a bad influence on the students especially the music from the ramones,0
still i found it very entertaining,1
br br murdering someone hiding in a bodybag though is a pretty original one as far as i know,0
some of the best cinematography ever done in the history of filmbr br in all five of the westerns that stewart and mann did together the supporting roles were perfectly cast,0
ca n't ask for more than thatbr br oh and if you 're lucky some moron will put the adverts reel in wrong and you 'll get inverted upside down reversed adverts,0
the acting of dominic monaghan is simply fantastic,0
the teens spend their days in and out of school and their nights at parties concerts or out on the street,0
my brother who plays tommy who lives beside me at home is a real joy to watch and i am always looking out the window at some of tom,1
the movie begins with lupino and nicholas who were friends for a couple years in pariscola in the early 90st century,1
she falls for this oddball of a man who is obsessed with chess,0
she gets the brunette thinking there 's something up between them and then she steals the boychildman which is only appropriate since they appear to be from the same age group,0
but they have a few moments in the script where you ca hardly believe what happens next,1
and did n't she look fantastic,0
it was like watching some sort of dream sequences from a dream,1
this film was directed and produced at a relatively young age but it certainly wasn't meant specifically to appeal exclusively or to follow in any way the popular movie,1
now we're still getting some good films in the mix as far as bad films go,1
a lot of fun to be had here if you 're a fan of the genre,0
this installment of the star trek franchise is in my opinion the first series since tos to recapture the feelings of wonder danger and excitement of going where no man has gone before,0
in any event i loved it this time giving it a 9 out of 10 or an abr br it might sound ridiculous saying i did n't get a film like this but there is something to get,0
the first film was just a silly one at that,1
there 'll be plenty of bad punters in this film in my eyes,1
i love matthau 's grumpy characterhe 's just the same as he always is and yet also very differentbr br burns as the absentminded old man is just as funny as matthaubr br matthau want some crackers,0
this is a challenging provocative movie that does not wrap things up neatly,0
br br paul does everything wrong from the start of his job interview and his getting hired clearly demonstrates carla 's interest in his nonjobrelated qualities,0
the way the film switches from black and white to colour and back again is well done and the film has such stellar actors as roger livesy marius goring and an early appearance from richard attenborough,0
not much else to write about either but this is about the best film i could n a film with such low expectations,1
this film is not very original at least not by mcconaugly,1
it 'll probably be one more hit to the video business,1
the movie is not good,1
even by his standards he'sets the bar above his usual standards,1
however he is not alone as the viewer is also led by albert davis as the villainous duke,1
the film is pretty much as it should have been a very wellcrafted story about a love triangle between a married couple,1
one of the things about the film that warmed my heart strings was that dry fly fishing was a major part of the scene,0
jamies on saturday night rock and make me cry,1
nevertheless there is a difference between alexandre and eustache if eustache is absolutely alexandre alexandre is like a double without art a horrible vision of the artist which crystallizes his fearsbr br by fallowing veronika at the end of the movie alexandre is condemned to illusions,0
the two kids have no choice in the matter of whether lila is dead for real or not and her parents are in love with her,1
i thoroughly enjoyed this movie because there was a genuine sincerity in the acting,0
i love these stalker type stories,0
but the thought of going back to prison with at least another ten years added on to his sentence was just too much for jimmy,0
still one thing i would say about this movie are its characters,1
after watching it i realized how sad lucille ball 's life really was,0
and family 's are forever and love means more then words,0
they believe san salvatore the castle they stay in has an enchanting effect on people,0
bottom line as pseudohistory painted on celluloid this western is compelling and fun,0
no other film can hold up to a truly memorable scene and when you watch it you see something new and different,1
she is also the mother of the child of the man who murdered the wife of the man who killed her,1
it is wellacted in its many parts and with a decent storyline the story is welltold and wellmade,1
to top it all up they should've been making an entirely different film with a much wider audience,1
with such a great story that has to be seen in the first movie you could really hope for the story and that there would be some good scenes,1
this is undeniably the scariest game i 've ever played,0
another reviewer noted this being a pretty funny movie for a laugh,1
810,0
he plays a very good and very smart guy and he tries every trick to get by the character which is what he excel 'cause he has to overcome that fear by being a great fighter and you just caress him,1
at the end the movie just becomes an excuse for another senseless senseless torturefestbrat i give it 4 stars,1
like his earlier film in a glass cage agust villaronga achieves an intense and highly poetic canvas that is even more refined visually than its predecessor,0
there was a tv commercial in japan a couple years before this movie came out,0
if one were to believe the impression that this film creates a matter of weeks even days passes between the time that ned kelly becomes a wanted man on the sayso of one corrupt policeman and the infamous shootout at glenrowan,0
my favorite character was the black girl,1
this particular production was directed with a much bigger scale production budget and an even bigger talent cast and some more sophisticated musical score,1
the scenery breathtaking and the message of love genuine,0
the story is well told and gives some really great moments,1
in the 35 years seince tos premiered the crew of star trek have become experts at economybr br ultimately they have decided quite rightly in my mind to abandon the look of tos and reverse engineered tng et all,0
it displays the amazing acting abilities of whoopi goldberg oprah winfrey and danny glover,0
an intelligent film,1
on that note deniro 's performance is spoton it 's not the excessive lisp that most actors use to portray gay people but a surprisingly effective one from someone used to being seen as a roughandgruff typecast character,0
this film has little to do with documentary and is more interesting in playing with our ideas of advertising and its relationship to reality,0
it made me laugh because some of the situations she found herself in were so ridiculous i had to laugh,0
still the action sequences are spectacular and will leave no time up for any action scenes,1
there are also many scenes of the people being picked up and held hostage in a way reminiscent of the movie'snuff filmsbradford 'the man with black hair 'branbridge street 'bradford hall and also of course 'the man with dark hair,1
the music is fantastic and is always a treat to follow the storyline and the characters from the first 2 films,1
i was n't looking for a superficial impersonation of lucy,0
one of our very favorites of my time,1
stealing them back and taking them across the canadian border he soon finds himself unwillingly drawn into the growing conflict between prospectors and the judge as he cheats or kills them out of their claims br br while it 's no great surprise which way stewart turns at the end he 's a surprisingly callous critter along the way even using his desire to just be left alone to excuse not warning a group of prospectors of an impending avalanche when he has the chance because it 's not his problem,0
personality and acting are so bad it 'll even shock if it were made in 1971 i wasn't even kidding when i said i was going to love this movie,1
it comes highly recommended to anyone looking for something unique and captivating and different from much of the repetitive films that are out there,0
the acting is all horrible and some scenes are just cheesy which makes it hard for me,1
polly moran is a maid,0
unfortunately it're not in black comedy,1
the tiny tim in this version of the christmas carol is a little tough to look at almost too sweet,0
it doesn't get much better than this,1
actually i believe that this is another one of his worst movies ever as well,1
br br but the best part of it all is that i was the happiest,1
it will be a great classic,1
you do n't have the total story but only fragments,0
ryan lennox is greatbrilliant and he plays this role with so little emotion that he can't help it,1
yellow is energetic playful selfaware explorative,0
busy is so amazing,0
best friends are on his case but they are so desperate i'm sure they're about to have a hardtime taking care not to mess her up,1
that 'll be finebr br,1
there're so few scenes that would remotely be considered to have been filmed before the camera was switched on,1
they'res a couple that work in a bar and then the husband is trying too hard to keep an eye on both of his kids and is constantly looking for the next one to fall down in a row but this time the guy is a little too busy,1
they are the first of five films to bring us our first clue in the new millennium as to the impact the bizarro world has on our society at this point,1
anybody that has read the book will know the original story,1
i also read ann rule 's book and saw the city confidential segment on ae,0
what 's even more alarming is that spielberg himself was n't even nominated for best director,0
true the actors do n't act true they talk a lot but what they talk about is just what makes life worth living or dying,0
while the script is a bit lightweight you ca n't help but like this movie or any of the characters in it,0
but even if it had been done as an independent movie rather than for a major studio or any other film company it would have been a good idea if it was shot with a budget as low as they were,1
there is also a whole lot of symbolism used in the film including how kyle william does his best to make his way across time for the sake that one,1
he has come to take part in fixing up the country since in his mind it 's about time germany was shown some charity,0
this movie did nve a really neat premise and i mean that a really cool twist as well as some really cool action scenes,1
in another example of how much the matador respects its characters bean instead of panicking at the presence of a hired killer in her house merely asks with forced calm did you bring your gun,0
when katherine finds out the truth about michael and dennis the first thing she can't figure the murderer of michael is michael 'father,1
meryl stratten gets topless and has some great dialog about how she feels and how everything changes,1
there're also some really bad looking robots which was just plain stupid,1
all the women are so attractive i thought that these were the very best actresses in their right minds,1
and there were a few plot twists that made the movie almost ridiculous,1
so many fine things to see,0
one day as he sits down to get a coffee,1
avoid it,1
the action sequences of this movie are breathtakingly amazing and the sword fights are serious and gritty,0
he is a good actor but it seems that if the script could actually handle a script written without him i think it would be a good movie,1
it shows that some people are truly oblivious to the awful things happening around them,0
watching the film i thought that it had been shot in brazil and i guess that was the case,1
the one guy in the bar is a great actor who acts very wellbrigitte foch plays a girl who has a lot to do in a year'sweeney 'the rose of the thai kingdom,1
he takes hold of the ebeneezer scrooge role and makes it his own and creates an incredible character,0
in this movie called the last wave an aboriginal native is murdered for no apparent reason,0
fabulous ladies in fabulous outfits in wonderful settings and the whole thing constantly on the move and accompanied by a wonderful bruno nicolai score,0
while he're doing this he goes to the library and finds a picture of an old guy dressed as a man and he says he found itbr br as i watched the movie the next day and then the afternoon i realized that this is just what i saw so i'm just grateful he made it because it actually wasn't a horrible film but still i would nst say his performance in the first part was pretty bad,1
the movie and book hit an emotional spot within my heart and i was weepy for several days after seeing the movie,0
well i'm pleased to report that most viewers should be well satisfied with the various knifings shootings impalements and other carnage that this film tastefully dishes out not to mention the crypts freaky dream sequence rats and bats the drug references a rape scene the obligatory red herrings and in the person of ugo pagliai a hunky leading man for the female viewers,0
he agrees but soon the stakes get higher when a girl who had admitted that she was responsible for most of the thefts is found murderedbr br hickory dickory dock is a solid brain exercise without being as mindnumbingly complicated as one two buckle my shoe,0
camera work is okay and the editing quality looks good,1
i contend that whoever is ultimately responsible for creatingapproving the trailer for this movie has completely blundered,0
see this movie if the devil desires you,1
of course the plot script and especially casting are strong in the film,0
of all the versions of the odyssey this in my opinion is the best of them all,0
the movie is a fastpaced frolic that does n't copout everything gets blown to smithereens at the end and that 's just as it should be,0
this works very well although changes from the book are few and basically the film remains true to the original story,0
the acting the characters the story,0
this show is a total waste,1
dull it as you've come,1
you laugh you cry you cheer it brings out every emotion imaginable,0
you pity don gallico yet at the same time you fear him enormously,0
the fighting scenes were very fast paced and complex,0
hence the movie was a bit difficult for my family and i had my head poked through while trying to find the correct words,1
or perhaps a movie,0
it takes itself extremely serious,1
br br i have always loved the films of alexander van peet and his partner marcel schoeniger,1
there're also some scenes like the final scene with a bunch of nikigod 'ingsters looking through a window to see all the dead bodies scattered about,1
in my opinion the whole thing was really just a very good way of ending the movie,1
having chronic insomnia jack is plagued by hallucinations causing him to try and determine what is real and what is n'tbr br we find out interesting things about jack near the end and think that by the time the movie is over we will have a happily ever after hollywood ending,0
they find out they have some things in common besides an animal attraction,0
as i said a perfect giallo,0
br br stewart is partner with ben,0
being a fan of the original it will be interesting and will make for interesting conversation,1
clouce danes is great as diana and richardson in the role of diana 'dad who works and is not very rich,1
he records his days with his family and hopes to become a rich and famous writer one day because of his observations,0
good movie the story is as good as ever but they make the actors look stupid,1
they are two very good actors and do very good jobs,1
on the other hand it'seem like some sort oaf,1
the cast and story has been done a great deal more effectively and it is the way the film is done that makes it so enjoyable to watch it is also the story itself the main actor is superbly cast,1
good show,1
i 'd watch it again with my daughter,0
serenade is a very good actioncommer and the first thing the movie tries to say is that if you want an actioncomming martial arts movie this is the movie for,1
for a more serious film this wasn't a good sign,1
most of the movie takes itself way to seriously and is very much a parody of the movie itself,1
there neighbours tell on other neighbours sometimes because their political views are contrary to the new regime but many people are told on because of old family fights or maybe the silent introvert who has no friends is told on by someone who wants to earn some points,0
it is quite obvious the movie is not worth viewing it wouldn't be so bad even if the plot were so poorly executed or had nary the acting or plot to work,1
anytime the dawkins character asks his question to a stranger the stranger responds by asking if my mother was killed by your father ',1
brite,1
stuck in a castle on an abandoned highwaybrained as it appears the story line is not entirely straightforward and the film is extremely poorly made,1
bratish,1
or perhaps it was the fact that they could not make any sense,1
a truly moving little story that deserves more credit than it is being given,0
a must for any serious film buff or for anyone interested in the stillmaligned marion davies,0
i graduated from high school in 1980 and i was surprised at how realistic it was,0
never in movies seems this predictable,1
the most powerful performance in his short and stinky run is probably that of a hickman,1
if you are sensitive at all either will bring tears to your eyes but anjos do sol may stay with you foreverbr br this is very depressing subject matter but i think no i hope that the film succeeds in bringing more attention to itbr br more people need to see this film,0
we have a guy in a boat who is being chased through the middle east with a guy in a boat,1
the chess comes alive as a tough competition much more than in say searching for bobby fischer in showing just how much hard mental work the game can be requiring thought preparation stamina and planning,0
ghost story was the pilot for the nbc series,0
riff is of course the fan of that original punk band the ramones and that band dishes out a baker 's dozen of its greatest songs during the course of the film including five at a concert that is a total blast,0
i 've heard that before where,0
tsui hark 's visual artistry is at its peek in this movie,0
the story is very realistic and believable i recommend you see a movie on this one it will be a huge inspiration,1
it was so stimulating also to see two identifiable characters in the lead roles without them having to be glossy magazine cover figures,0
in the first scene we see a very bad scene in the movie that shows a woman trying in the end to do a dance to her uncle 'theodore rossbr br that is just awful,1
this time there are christmas themed opening closing crypt keeper segments complete with the usual punsbr br director zemeckis does a good job there 's a nice winterly atmosphere with a hint of christmas influence as well,0
they do n've a great chemistry which is really funny because the whole idea of the movie was that michael jackman and lenny was a great team and had a good chemistry but they fell apart on this movie because of the fact that the movie was so badbrash but a very good action moviebrilliant,1
according to them the nx01 is how it is because of the incident in first contact,0
the two boys were well,0
it also gives us the kindest sense that a movie is more than just a film,1
over the course of the movie they realize their problems and begin fixing them,0
why do people actually say that the journey is just that amazing,0
a chinese fantasy picture may not be easy to present to an audience the director attempted to bring back the classic fantasy tales of zu mountain and this is what he displayedbr br the new legend of zu has truly improved from the one in 1983 from this new millenium update we could see tsui hark 's vision of the zu mountains,0
at this point it seems like the filmmakers were more concerned with creating the templates for future action figures than with the quality of the film itselfbr br another aspect is its lack of originality,0
this was a low rate film so when it came to the film release the movie release would get more attention,1
because that 'll always be true and just the way the film is madebr br as a bonus i're being generous a little and the duc dillier version also features a couple of beautiful nude scenes not included in a few of the other movies br br and to think that i was watching the same movie with this same problem,1
but unlike the other two this film was one which did n't overdo the graphics and the whole thing was tasteful,0
too bad,1
it is the best film i have seen in quite some time and certainly one of the most important films i have been waiting for,1
if anyone has the full lyrics please send thembr br of course one big reason why my wife and i liked this series so much was that we are 75 years old and retired but still very active intellectually,0
how many lines do we get to read that can only come with a little more workbrilliance,1
boy was i wrong,0
willy is obnoxious in the extreme fully deserving ben 's description crazy freakin' old man but you root for him throughout enjoying his small victories even when they come at the cost of others' patience,0
the most disturbing part of the movie consists in a very bad flashback which basically just leads to the very obvious ending,1
it is n the same sort of story,1
to me a matter of life and death is just that simply the best film ever madebr br from beginning to end it oozes class,0
they also do have to deal witlessly,1
unfortunately the best part of this episode was the fight scene as the girls had been in complete control over themselves for a long time before the episode got goingbrilliantbrilliarbr br the most irritating thing about this episode is the way it was directed,1
the little ghostie girl was very talented and i think her performance stole the show,0
the plot is ridiculous at times the characters are annoying even by today've standards,1
the movie is a bit too long to remember everything is told through a flashback but the storyline doesn't do that any harm especially once i think back over everything,1
well i just got done watching it and the front of my shirt must be soaked after crying buckets,0
the other stars of the show are the sigfreid and roy,0
then he announces he has to go to the theater,0
this one 'll blow your socks off,1
and the ending is the one which really hit it'stopping point i swear i could not stop looking for more,1
if the audience would like to know what happened this film is not for that at that time it was on the front page of the local newspaper and my friend and we watched the film,1
this is followed by her and cooper being taken to the war camp and being tortured,0
my vote is tenbr br title anjos do sol,0
the plot is stupid and boring,1
i first saw this movie back in the early '90 's when it was first released,0
to me no amount is worth selling this treasure,0
other than that just do n't see it,0
his family and his best friends are killed on the job,1
if the few minor flaws were not there this could rate even brighter and higher,0
robert redford lives near me here in provo utah at sundance,0
bruno 'beau aubournt is a beautiful man and a masterful director,1
they have some really good actors in this thing the head coach guy and the player that likes pete were very good and the plot has already got me but i do n't really understand how they 'll keep it stretched for a whole season there will probably be some big twist tho i cant wait till tuesday finally jeremy sumpter who is he,0
this is the best film version of dicken 's classic tale,0
she and her mother are having a baby who doesn't like being touched at her new jobbr the best part of the new job is that kate gets to meet her father at the end,1
whoopi goldberg gives her best performance ever in this movie,0
i was disappointed not to be able to find it yet on dvd,0
i can honestly say i never expected this movie to be good,0
the ending is too silly and predictable with all the people being killed off in a pointless attempt at redemptionbrat and i would have liked to have had this movie included on the dvd,1
she stores every bit of information she collects in an enormous archive,0
the main characters are pretty much the same as the rest but this time they are more like children than characters who have anything to saybragman is good as the boy and he carries the story,1
it really intrigued me how deanna and alicia became friends over such a tragedy,0
but at the same time these movies are n't cheesy,0
boy do dixie suck,1
that said i can't stress enough that this film truly isn't for everyone,1
peter weir created a perplexing but thoughtprovoking movie,0
i do n't know if america 's gonna like it but we were laughing all the way through,0
he gives this film the benefit of the better knowledge of that film to keep his audience interested,1
the zombie,0
good movie i wish more directors would see this film and give the movie a chancebr br 710br br it is a classic bad movie and there are many reasons to watch one in life,1
even the main male characters have a role which could be called sexual,1
then it leads on to them all having a family trip and then that 's when they really do fall for each other,0
then there are the big budget hong kung kong movies and most people wont be able,1
br br of course the notion of nature striking back has a certain resonance now thirty years later,0
anyway i didn't know what jeanmarie was doing before seeing her but i can tell you the acting in there should have won her any award or anythingbr br i have a little bias towards horror films,1
there 's some excellent music which many folks have mentioned but no one seems to notice a very rare appearance by angel a now mostly ignored but once quite popular musical outfit,0
tonys and charlie 'go to the same bar in the evening and the place is closed down but tony is at home with his wife and his four children,1
this continuous understatement is part of the film 's appealbr br the innovative photography and cinematography even includes some nice touches portraying the interests of the filmmakers,0
i first saw it when it as the christmas attraction at radio city music hall when it first came out and loved it ever since,0
the initial rehearsal is a failure but ben manages to get them to the taping of the show,0
difference in perspective,1
george cloake and the other performers deliver some nice performances as the parents of three kids,1
robin should have stopped filming this in the 70ies and that would have had the effect of making the film even more pathetic,1
iris' husband is dead from an illness and with the multiple references in the film about the costs of medical care the viewer must wonder if he might have lived with better and more costly care,0
if you're on the fence of whether this is a good or a horrible cartoon for children but just want to have something that makes you think twice about wasting your time on this film i recommend that 'em go ahead and watch 'nightmare rides 2 the next time,1
throughout her life she meets an assortment of characters including sophia a tough as nails wife to her step son and shug a loud and luscious saloon singer who teaches her a thing or two about lovebr br speilberg 's direction is all over this picture which offers brilliant cinematography and some stellar performances,0
i really truly enjoyed this movie,0
my friend had to turn it and watch this movie,1
had we ever taken a different tack and made this film into something really scary,1
still it was better to see his later films in fact even that is a bit better,1
br br the story however doesn't go very far and the script is so bad that it makes the story even longerbrittany murray and tilda swank are a little irritating but both caress the story and have an excellent performance,1
for the time being we had a big problem in our own family as the story dragged on we all agreed it was a total failure to capture this typecasting in any way possible the characters were annoying their jokes were laughable and at times very boring even for a western it was a real shame it was nashdale,1
aside from the intense slapstick scenes there are others more subtle but just as funny,0
it 'll always remain a favourite of mine,1
the absence of violence and porno sex was refreshing,0
that'seems to me to be the message that is delivered to all this movie the poor thing is going to go insane and kill everyone before he can get away with such a thingbrillantbrilliant,1
gelstein did n've a few interesting moments including an amusing joke about the fact that the police force was on his watch because of the death or something but that was about the last time that i saw him do it or somethingbranagh in a similar situation does 'not have a conscience'but is not an evil ',1
this kind of situations are purely cinematographic and cannot be fully restored in a commentary,0
the two convicts he trusts most are jackson and ben,0
jabba is a very effective animatronic character one of the most elaborate ever constructed,0
now for the thing that makes it so funny about the way jimmy is treated the fact that he is the same age at which he plays sam is all that makes the film funny,1
after a while a woman shows up and starts dating a little boy but then you can tell she really has trouble keeping her boyfriend from going off on him,1
they have a great website which is worth checking out,0
ali lahman is wonderful as mike who 'll give you the look and the power you need,1
this movie is really about how you can get involved with and love it,1
the most glaring problem is that even the two women who played the lead women are so unlikables that they're laughable,1
rose was really in love with jimmy 's good friend the happy go lucky fred despite his obnoxious antics towards her,0
it 's under these hectic conditions that tax lawyer david burton richard chamberlaingot involved in a case as a defense attorney involving the death of a local aborigine who was found dead outside a sydney bar,0
overcome with his own feelings about the way things are but he finds himself trapped in a world that will never return,1
apocalypse now on tv is the perfect time,1
the ending to what was obviously some sort of revenge is quite abrupt and pointless i thinkbrimming with great music is alfred the father of some of the kids and of the father who is a master in the ways he has played with people,1
he has dumped the slick armani suits for a ridiculous look and pays off showing that he is an excellent actor,0
from there we're introduced a bunch more characters then usual and a few more than normal flashbacksbrrr my biggest beef,1
he just does nsthe film is simply boring and very well produced,1
had this never been made it may have been a very interesting concept but as i'm still wondering why is danny devito always known as 'the guy with no name on the cover of the box office,1
direction is lighthearted and flows nicely,0
hopkins tries very poorly to be the cool guy and he really doesn't fit,1
a super unusual film from audiard read my lips is a pulpy lonely hearts thriller,0
strange and weird,0
then the characters are the main characters,1
and after all we are none of us past hoping,0
the only complaint i have is the subtitles on the hk dvd version i got br br i just do n't understand when i read hear from various sources it has a confusing plot i could n't follow the story or characters came from nowhere,0
the only cautionary statement about xica is that it occasionally contains some harsh scenes therefore i would recommend that children under 14 do not watch xica,0
the best thing about it was the music,1
therefor it is a pleasure for one self to watch it over and over again,0
there're really no surprises,1
this movie should be seen twice more by anyone interested in the subject,1
the scene where paul refuses to eat oatmeal and the entire family has to wait an eternity to say grace,0
it wasn't enough to have the killer get away with murder even if it made no profit and as we saw he wasn't one and that it took some time to get the killer to do it,1
who is the killer and why is the killer after them,0
this film will have to wait until mike and jake've passed along the word about the film to see for themselves whether they like the film very much or whether it will take some people for the film to become too obviousbr br this is a very fine film,1
the characters were all so different and yet clever story that made it work,0
although i have not a clue what she was thinking it is very strange that i would not be able to see this movie,1
till he achieves the maturity to discern pedestal divas from real womenbr br stardust is a fullon large scale fantasy that does credit to its myriad stars,0
br br i have to say i had my reservations,0
matthau was nominated for best actor but did n't stand a chance against nicholson for one flew over the cuckoo 's nest however in another year this was an oscarworthy performance,0
as we move down the tracks the voice of the narrator counts us down into a deep sleep until we awake in europa,0
when the credits started rolling i was in a bit dizzier than i did at first,1
i think that this movie will be a hit and will be seen over and over again my many people,0
or as one critic put their thoughts it 'll be the most beautiful picture you ever see,1
the look and feel of the film is great the effects are entertaining and some of the humor will just sail right over kid 's heads but still older ones might enjoy it,0
the first thing i thought when i saw this films was it is not really a film at least it is not what we imagine spontaneously when we hear the word film,0
this film is about the lives of two women and their struggle to come to grips with the reality of what really happened in a time when there weren't many real love stories,1
in fact it was so very boring at the very very start where you know you must get out if things go downhill quickly,1
there is an innocent american who gets emotionally involved with a woman he does n't really understand and whose naivety is all the more striking in contrast with the nativesbr br but i 'd have to say that the third man has a more wellcrafted storyline,0
voiced by john mackenzie,1
i think the best line of the film is burns mentioning that matthau called him a son of a bitch bastard,0
the fact is the film isn't really the same,1
two girls are attacked by the monster one is attacked by the killer car and car'sses,1
it is no surprise that writerdirector michael powell considered a matter of life and death his and emeric pressburger 's spellbinding fantasy from 1946 to be his favourite of their films together,0
best part is the way johnny gets rid of the annoying guy named goliath,1
it 's a beautifully made film without any flaws about the life of an africanamerican woman,0
this is in itself a good movie but it is just too much to make it watchable,1
not just that it is an amusing movie,1
and found home room and it was already in about 5 min but i got hooked,0
and you may well want to watch it several times i dobr br 910,0
if nothing could make me laugh there would be a lot of good jokes in the film though it would still be a tad bit more boring,1
the film is also very well directed with great acting from all of them making it easy for the viewer to feel the story in all of the main characters,1
two complaints the actress who played viv vance not great casting at all,0
the film 'chances for your own salvation is more realistic,1
it will have you hookedbrad pender makes a fine first impression as the father of the little girlbrick a little girl who is a bit more naivebr br i'midget with three fingers,1
it is one of the most entertaining shows on tv and a must see for the kids in this town,1
this is actually the kindest movie ever made in fact that i was not shocked that it was never released to film on dolby videobr br i loved the concept,1
due to its poor script i will be left with another complaint in my review so i 'll be adding it to my list but i will do so so that everyone in the world can see how disappointing the film was br br i couldn't understand any part that they were trying to tell about this movie as well as the character of dr mike,1
lost in the madness of the novel was the title the story of a young doctor 'who has been assigned medicine because of the death of his colleague a very young woman,1
michelle pfeiffer is the perfect witch and claire danes a wonderful choice for the innocent and loving 'star' yvaine,0
each character brought a unique personality to the story that the audience could easily associate with someone they know within their own family or circle of close friendsbr br the story has a truetolife flow that the viewer can assimilate into and be part of the drama the laughter and tears as the plot of the movie develops,0
she gives every bit of the indian woman essence in this film,0
strike a deal as this gets you nowhere,1
apples of paradise is an extremely wellacted production that does not lose any of the tension in the film,1
i fell in love with emily watson in breaking the waves then grew even more fascinated by her range and adeptness in hilary and jackie,0
casting does have a lot to do in terms that it was filmed at the same time and has the exact right feeling of the era and it adds everything a viewer need to know about today 'br br that said i would give it a 3 out of 10 to say i am definitely one to watch a movie over and i hope that i amn't forgetting the fact that these were not my favorite films,1
there 's something valuable about the song and neither reeves nor farlan knows what it is,0
it 'll give you the same kindof reaction as when the movie starts,1
the situation of tragedy was artificially created,0
outstanding acting i thought,1
the cops come and everything but no mention of all the underage drinking and how these kids got their hands on this stuffbr br foxes belongs right there with over the edge fast times dazed confused and kids as one of the all time teen angst flicksbr br i say buy it and watch it with your kids and talk about it all,0
there is an interesting amount more sex and nudity in the picture than you might have expected from a john doves movie and a much larger amount of horror,1
thuriel in one of his first big screen performances and james cagney is on top form in the next role which he made in 'the fugitive'as he played cagneys agent in a previous movie that was not really as good but in a much lesser role as inspector gordon,1
but if you like mystery drama comedy and a little forensic work you 'll love this show,0
and then they learned that well maybe its not that bad after all,0
it is an oldfashioned story,1
however i have to say that while the film was enjoyable even as a teen i don't think the film really held my interest throughout the 70 min,1
in real life the man played the captain of an army air force has never been given a medal despite the fact that it was onebr br the problem with this film is the fact that you couldn't have more of the same,1
the special edition of this film is a great addition to the longrunning michael bay series,1
appearing in all three of the seven films this was probably meant to be like any other but no one really did it except for the title character so it're almost always a bad move to just call her a villain,1
its the kind that makes it worth watching and its just a nice little surprise,1
let me say this if you are a fan of george burns or walter matthau you should see this movie right away,0
what a pity that it is n't,0
some of the scenes where i found the music interesting were the ones where the actors and actresses do the same thing as the actors and you can tell it is a story about some people trying for different goals,1
anyone else who has seen it knows a lot of it in his life and probably will like it,1
that scene which is filmed on a big screen with very poor sound,1
this is why i hate bad filmsbrittleness of plot or lack of characterization is as bad as they comebr br,1
han leia and chewy battle it out on endor desperate to deactivate the shields protecting the death star,0
mujhe haq hai and do anjaane ajnabi are nice ballads,0
the movie is a mixture of comedy and horror,1
let me first state that while i have viewed every episode of startrek at least twice i do not consider myself a trekker or trekkie,0
interesting point it is a film that i did n've heard of but is now available at the imdb,1
and to be fair the script gives him a lot more to do than the other characters,0
everyone should know what an excellent movie this is,0
at least you get a good look behind the mask of his past that gives some background informationbrash and twisted this is not the best horror film of all the year,1
there is so much in this movie just a bunch to think,1
his other mistress is definitely more attractive than the actual woman,0
hopkins has proved once and for revenge she knows the full meaning,1
it gets a thumbs down for being a real family film and has a nice ending that leaves a lasting impressionbr,1
why is that when i saw the original i thought hey we 'll probably all get a little more enjoyment from this movie,1
much anticipated twisted comedy from writerdirector richard shepard is a coming out party for pierce brosnan the actor,0
the whole thing is very contrived and barely conceals the fact that the solo character was not part of this film 's central story after his rescue,0
that film was released in 1982 and has a cult status among moviegoers,1
as a matter of fact you 'll find the whole film beautifully photographed and it was nice to see they did n't skimp in that department,0
who is paying to have people killed,0
additionally the movie seems to be written by someone in a wheelchair and all of the characters were obviously forced to work while trying not be embarrassed by the fact that they are therebr br if you're like most people you've never seen an action movie before but you will definitely like the characters and the acting in general for their part,1
i do n't think i have see anything like this in a long time on network or cable television,0
i guess nobody really knows because there will always be two camps who will each tell their own truth one camp says he was a hero some kind of robin hood the others will say he was an ordinary criminal a murderer and a thief,0
i was surprised though that she went so far as to seduce benny 's father,0
the film is made up of several segments,1
lois who plays nancy is a talented actress who is nip the popcorn on her head a little bit but otherwise she does what she does best,1
they are all on the run from the law who are afraid to show their faces and their methods aren't nearly as bad as they had earlier,1
his father'shia qin and father'shia qin'is also involved in the film,1
710,1
especially one that i 'd want to comment on,0
the idea of an evil person that is able communicate through the internet is one of the most compelling things in tv history and the series is simply breathtakingly powerfulbrilliant,1
but the only reason this episode was nastypants is to have the character be a prostitute,1
despite that some of the japanese apparitions are a bit goofy too many of the costumes scarsely more than masks without even moving lips as they speak it is all played very pokerfaced is very charming,0
but paul sees a grander opportunity with carla 's skill in lip reading and draws her even further into a world of intriguebr br this is a brutal film noir unrated and probably suitable for older teens,0
personally i never liked brosnan as bond because he fit the icon too closely,0
the only interesting thing i noticed about a couple of the movie is nami'seems a lot of the characters have nothing to do with eachother they're just in each other'and have no idea what to say other then talk,1
jeremy sumpter does an excellent job as a teenager with a passion for baseball i believe a lot of us could relate to his awe and sometimes tunnel vision for the team that he always wanted to a part of,0
his reactions after being given a mickey by christine mcintyre are superb he gives his trademark sound and miss mcintyre is noticeably trying not to laugh,0
there is a certain charm to this film but in many places the plot becomes tiresome,1
but the story went on and focused on the rocky relationship between lucy desi,0
when i started watching this show last summer i did n've never seen it before,1
some scenes could at times be taken as a warning but the scenes here are simply uninspired,1
it've all of the ingredients that make a classic classic fun to look at,1
edward woodward is everything we expect and more of the ghost of christmas present,0
wonderfully well written and directed it creates the atmosphere of a dream as the viewer is taken through one night in the life of an insomniacbr br starring dominic monaghan as jack we get to see everything he sees as the long hours of a lonely night drag on,0
the whole film is done on the cheap so no one can afford to mess with it,1
if you want to see a few great actors do what they do best then i suggest you see this film and do n't worry about the accuracy of the facts,0
if you like this you will love i hope they make another one,1
not recommended,1
it is a film that respects it characters enough to just let them get on with it without feeling the need to shove them into needless plot contrivancesbr br brosnan 's hitman will inevitably be compared to his bond but this is unfair to both performances,0
in most of these films the story takes place in a city which has become almost unrecognizablism,1
there is no killing or horror here,0
unbelievable,1
the stories in this video are very entertaining and it definately is worth a look,0
conversely there are those who warn us of not preparing for what they warn is the 'end time',0
he is very strong and i have noticed a lot of his acting ability in this picture,1
oh yeah i did not buy this at all,1
in our household we are enormous fans of a christmas carol and watch virtually every version each christmas including the old 1938 reginald owen and the modern 1999 patrick stewart,0
henne does nuts to them and they fall apart,1
the fatcheek woman such were recreated by tricks or illusions based on monsters depicted in medieval scrolls if their design for the movie is a bit simple hoky this makes them all the more representative of what historically was recreated for summer chillsbr br these rather endearing monsters have to face off destroy an ancient babylonian vampire demon who has come to japan disguised himself as a samurai lord,0
this doesn't even include the story,1
boy are you wrong,0
not only do they suddenly appear at some very funny times and in some funny ways reminding the viewer that this is fiction and artifice but their presence is itself another layer of the film they are filming themselves filming themselves,0
thing alexandre 'br br he was one of the best directors ever,1
now we knowhe made this movie,0
still it was fun to watch him do his own thing with that,1
if you want action thrills dramatic sex scenes natural or manmade disasters or harlequin style romances this would not be the film for you,0
in my eyes the movie is a piece that should be seen by all,1
his interaction makes andie 's character living as entertaining as it could possibly be,0
sooraj sir is back to what he does best,0
but there was amrita rao who has become my favorite after main hoon na,0
the only flaw i can see about this film is that it was n't captured in a more technically perfect film format,0
